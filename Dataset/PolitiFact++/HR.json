    "text":"At the CNN debate in Miami, GOP candidates sparred over immigration, social security, how to talk about Muslims and more. Here are the key moments. (Video: Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)\n\nGift Article Share\n\nDonald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. John Kasich debated Thursday night in Miami, five days before the winner-take-all GOP primary in Florida. The complete transcript is posted below. Washington Post reporters and readers using Genius have annotated it, and will continue to do so following the debate.\n\nTo see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\n\n\n\nJake Tapper introduced the candidates and the debate began.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, we will start with you.\n\nKASICH: Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I believe it's a new partnership -- a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio?\n\nRUBIO: Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.\n\nRUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.\n\nThis election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before -- 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old -- never voted before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.\n\nWe're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nLet's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in -- on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls \"disastrous trade deals\" in order to bring jobs back to America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernor Kasich, I'd like to start with you. You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?\n\nKASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.\n\nBut my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \"Oh, America was right,\" and people are out of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.\n\nBut we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.\n\nTrade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.\n\nWhy should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, \"generally very much in favor of free trade.\" More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?\n\nRUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.\n\nThe problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.\n\nOn the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?\n\nCRUZ: Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.\n\nAnd the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.\n\nAnd you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.\n\nNumber one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?\n\nRUBIO: If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.\n\nThe second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire -- Disney or some other company hires this company.\n\nWhat they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.\n\nIt is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou've -- in the -- in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.\n\nRUBIO: Correct.\n\nDINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.\n\nRUBIO: Well first, I think -- well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.\n\nIf there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not -- what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.\n\nThey are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \"lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\". He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?\n\nKAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.\n\nImmigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we -- I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.\n\nI would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.\n\nAnd I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.\n\nBut let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.\n\nWe can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.\n\nTRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\n\nWhen it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of -- and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.\n\nAnd I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.\n\nWe have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just -- we're leading with the chin.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nWe're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.\n\nDINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?\n\nCRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.\n\nAnd the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.\n\nWe're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not that we don't know how to do it. It's that we're lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.\n\nThe Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.\n\nCRUZ: We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.\n\nThe problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.\n\nBut today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.\n\nMr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core?\n\nTRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don't want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.\n\nAnd it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well.\n\nSo there are a lot of things. But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.\n\nTAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say \"education by Washington, D.C.,\" what do you mean?\n\nTRUMP: You're right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.\n\nNow in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?\n\nKASICH: Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.\n\nSecondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.\n\nNot only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.\n\nNow on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.\n\nWe need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.\n\nFrankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.\n\nSo let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That's what it is in the state of Ohio.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What's wrong with that?\n\nCRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.\n\nNow, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBeyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.\n\nAnd let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child -- African American, Hispanic -- every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.\n\nLet me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \"We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\" they're not being honest with you.\n\nSocial Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.\n\nFor example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIf I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.\n\nThese are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my -- my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.\n\nBut again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.\n\nThat's -- all of it will be eaten up by that. That's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.\n\nAnd that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.\n\nI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.\n\nTRUMP: And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.\n\nYou have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...\n\nI mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a -- it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.\n\nWe've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?\n\nTRUMP: Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take -- every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.\n\nWe have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?\n\nRUBIO: No. And I -- and I think you've outlined why. The numbers don't add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida.\n\nFraud is not enough. Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don't add up.\n\nThe bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.\n\nAnd here's the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It's barely been asked in any of these debates. And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up. What's your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up. What's your response, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't know if he's saying that. Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it. I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don't bid things out. We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don't go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That's what they're paying.\n\nAnd the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don't bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?\n\nI'm self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don't want anybody's money. I will tell you something. We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We're going to save a fortune. (APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?\n\nCRUZ: Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible. And any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions.\n\nIt's like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Here's my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... Washington right now who are killing jobs and I'll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them.\n\nBASH: Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?\n\nCRUZ: I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there's a reason, in my campaign I've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can't take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nIf we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Thank you Senator Cruz.\n\nMr. Trump, would you like to respond?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and -- at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.\n\nBASH: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.\n\nWhen I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: When I led the fight against amnesty, it's because I was standing with the people...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... against Washington. And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?\n\nBASH: OK. Mr. Trump, I'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I'm going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead.\n\nTRUMP: Well, that's fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there's no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.\n\nAnd there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We're all in this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Governor Kasich, let's get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, \"Get over cuts to Social Security benefits\" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?\n\nKASICH: Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.\n\nI also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.\n\nKASICH: I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.\n\nIf you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. That's the way it will work. And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I've done all this before.\n\nThis is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn't mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century.\n\nSo not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We're up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.\n\nAnd I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nLet's take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.\n\nHow are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I don't really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.\n\nYou look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.\n\nYou look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that's that.\n\nBut I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.\n\nIf you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.\n\nAnd if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: ... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision?\n\nCRUZ: Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He's right about the problems. But his solutions don't work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.\n\nNow he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don't know where he'll be tonight. But I'll tell you what happens. You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.\n\nAnd the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.\n\nA much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, we'll give you a chance to respond.\n\nTRUMP: The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don't behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can't. China won't let them. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.\n\nChina dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. We can't get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.\n\nThe 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It's not China that pays the tax. It's you, the working men and women.\n\nSo ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, \"I'm going to jack -- I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.\" That hurts you.\n\nIt's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nTRUMP: Jake, I have to say -- honestly, it's just the opposite. What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we'll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.\n\nSo we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products. And that's the way it should be done. And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country -- our country is in serious, serious trouble. It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me.\n\nTAPPER: All right. We're going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.\n\nMr. Trump, let me start with you. Last night, you told CNN quote, \"Islam hates us?\" Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.\n\nTRUMP: I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.\n\nDINAN: Do you want to clarify the comment at all?\n\nTRUMP: Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today. And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry -- Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree?\n\nRUBIO: Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It's a very tough place to be a missionary. It's Muslim.\n\nAnd their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.\n\nI can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be.\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Marco talks about consequences. Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems.\n\nNow you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don't want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nNow I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: We better solve the problem before it's too late.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio?\n\n(APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Well, here we go. See, I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line. We do work. There is -- Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.\n\nThere is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other -- with Muslims, who do not -- who are not radicals. We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.\n\nWe're going to have to work with the Saudis. We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.\n\n(BELL RING)\n\nRUBIO: It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.\n\nAnd so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGovernor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?\n\nKASICH: No, I don't. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn't any question. And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBut look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states.\n\nAnd we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just -- they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.\n\nLook, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view. But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.\n\nMr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, \"take out\" the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, \"So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?\"\n\nIt is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?\n\nTRUMP: Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting \"death to the USA.\" Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me.\n\nAs far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law -- this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we're working on a different set of parameters.\n\nNow, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.\n\nWe better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\n\nRUBIO: No, of course not. And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It's difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They're going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.\n\nAnd then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because -- because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had.\n\nWe are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent. And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally.\n\n(APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you've talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\n\nCRUZ: No, of course not. We've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we've faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening.\n\nBut the answer is not simply to yell, \"China bad, Muslims bad.\" You've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.\n\nCRUZ: And I'll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that's a mistake.\n\nThe Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I'll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nAs president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Thank you Senator Cruz.\n\nMr. Trump. we're going to come to you in a second, but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, \"sort of a neutral guy\". He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.\n\nHe was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am. OK. There's nobody.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: I am pro-Israel.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nTRUMP: I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I've made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of -- I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is -- I'm a negotiator. If I go in, I'll say I'm pro-Israel and I've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.\n\nBut I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done.\n\nHEWITT: Senator Trump...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it's maybe the world deal I've ever seen. I think it's the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.\n\nCRUZ: You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they're our strongest ally in the region.\n\nWe get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization.\n\nThey pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad.\n\nLet me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... Islamic terrorist. HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\n\nCRUZ: He's hunting them down and stomping them.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you.\n\nCRUZ: Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.\n\nHEWITT: I want to go back to the Israeli government's assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree.\n\nRUBIO: Well, that's undeniable. First of all, they've said, they've encouraged people to do so. And you've seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things.\n\nBut let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don't know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn't.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: Because there's no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that's what will happen again.\n\nThese groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nSo maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, and then I'll come to you Senator Kasich.\n\nRUBIO: And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel's enemies.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMr. Trump a response and then we'll go to Governor Kasich.\n\nTRUMP: If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.\n\nBut I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it's tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel.\n\nAnd some believe it's possible. It may not be, in which case we'll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.\n\nHEWITT: Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence?\n\nKASICH: Well, there's no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?\n\nSecondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you're familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground.\n\nAnd I just have to tell you this, I don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix -- to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq.\n\nFrom the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?\n\nCRUZ: We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We're not using our overwhelming air power. We're not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.\n\nBut, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.\n\nThey're not able to fight. They're not able to defend themselves. They're not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that's what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?\n\nKASICH: Hugh, I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9\/11, in and out for a couple of years.\n\nWe absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer -- is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.\n\nAnd you bring all the force you need. It has got to be \"shock and awe\" in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, more troops? TRUMP: We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice.\n\nHEWITT: How many...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we're not allowed to fight. We can't fight. We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.\n\nI mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we're kidding. They didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint. We don't fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don't even know what we're doing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nLet's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.\n\nSenator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.\n\nWhat specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He's struggling with the V.A.\n\nThe other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, \"Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail.\" Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen -- one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died.\n\nPeople need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit -- Bernie Sanders was a part of this -- we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.\n\nSenior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working. The problem is no one's being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach. No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one's been disciplined. No one's been demoted.\n\nWhen I'm president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. (APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9\/11 GI Bill.\n\nShould veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?\n\nKASICH: I don't -- I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.\n\nNumber two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.\n\nAnd secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job.\n\nAnd when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLet's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.\n\nTwo of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made -- after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime.\n\nIt will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people.\n\nThere has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.\n\nAnd we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.\n\nHe asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't really agree with President Obama. I think I'm somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making -- as usual with our country, we don't make good deal. We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.\n\nAs an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.\n\nAll that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don't want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be -- should take place. After 50 years, it's enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.\n\nThis was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?\n\nTRUMP: I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor. It the same way as the Iran deal.\n\nWe never walked -- we never -- all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give.\n\nBASH: But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana.\n\nTRUMP: I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. (APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It's the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don't have to close it that way. Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose.\n\n(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)\n\nThird, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified. Here's a good deal -- Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That's a good deal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?\n\nCRUZ: Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\n\nThere's a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCUBA: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated. So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.\n\nBASH: Senator Cruz, your response?\n\nCRUZ: Well, look. I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.\n\nCRUZ: And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don't just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.\n\nWe need a commander in chief that understands our enemies...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don't come back early -- three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way. If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate. They come back early.\n\nWhat you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster.\n\nTed, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.\n\nBASH: Thank you Mr. Trump. Let's refocus this back on Cuba.\n\nGovernor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama's policy in Cuba that we've been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?\n\nKASICH: No, I wouldn't. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are.\n\nYou won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.\n\nAnd then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake.\n\nYou need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: ... and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don't own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.\n\nWe will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us. We're not rattling a sword. You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.\n\nAnd a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nWhen I'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening.\n\nMayor Regalado told me, quote, \"Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?\" Unquote.\n\nSenator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?\n\nRUBIO: Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: There's never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?\n\nSo on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.\n\nAnd I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.\n\nLet me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.\n\nRUBIO: The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.\n\nAnd you know what passing those laws would have -- what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.\n\nTAPPER: So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change.\n\nWhen you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?\n\nRUBIO: I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass -- if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.\n\nOne, because America is not a planet. It's a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here's what he will immediately -- and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend -- but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.\n\nHe will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami? KASICH: Well, I -- I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both.\n\nIn our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we're trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power.\n\nAnd you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.\n\nNow, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.\n\nSo the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nSenator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, \"foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed.\" Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?\n\nCRUZ: Of course it does. And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.\n\nThen he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, \"it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us.\"\n\nAnd that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.\n\nIt's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That's why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said: \"When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.\"\n\nHow do you respond...\n\nTRUMP: That doesn't mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it.\n\nAs far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin.\n\nTAPPER: But the word strong obviously is a compliment...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: ... and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.\n\nTRUMP: I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: And strong doesn't mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think?\n\nKASICH: I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front -- that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one.\n\nNumber two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command.\n\nAnd they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will.\n\nAnd when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.\n\nWe're going to take another quick break. When we come back, we'll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.\n\nMr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.\n\nToday, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, \"this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence.\" Do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?\n\nTRUMP: I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people -- you've seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest -- in some cases -- you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like. But when they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable. They have anger.\n\nThey love this country. They don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know -- I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There's also great love for the country. It's a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: Some of your critics point to quotes you've made at these debates -- at these rallies including February 23rd, \"I'd like to punch him in the face,\" referring to a protesters. February 27th, \"in the good ol' days, they'd have ripped him out of that seat so fast.\" February 1st, \"knock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\"\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don't mind. But doing serious damage. And if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something.\n\nAnd it's not me. It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It's usually the police -- and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo we should pay -- we should truly give our police. They're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election?\n\nCRUZ: Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we're working for. You know, we've seen for seven years a president who believes he's above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he's working for the American people.\n\nAnd let me -- let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y'all feel disrespected by Washington?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Washington isn't listening to the people. And that's the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald's rallies recently, he's taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.\n\nNow, I got to say to me, I think that's exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And the only hand raising I'm interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you senator.\n\nMr. Trump, if you'd like to respond.\n\nTRUMP: It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having -- on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we're talking and I'm saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. T",

    "text":"Thank you! Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.\n\nIt is wonderful to be here with all of you.\n\nTo be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.\n\nTo be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.\n\nTo be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.\n\nAnd in a place\u2026 with absolutely no ceilings.\n\nYou know, President Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation\u2019s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nTwo Democrats guided by the \u2014 Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\n\nPresident Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there\u2019s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: \u201cEquality of opportunity\u2026 Jobs for those who can work\u2026 Security for those who need it\u2026 The ending of special privilege for the few\u2026 The preservation of civil liberties for all\u2026 a wider and constantly rising standard of living.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds good to me.\n\nIt\u2019s America\u2019s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.\n\nThat bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.\n\nIt\u2019s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.\n\nIt\u2019s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.\n\nWhen President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.\n\nWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.\n\nWe\u2019re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.\n\nInstead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the end.\n\nAs we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.\n\nYou worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs\u2026 you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again \u2013 going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.\n\nSo we\u2019re standing again. But, we all know we\u2019re not yet running the way America should.\n\nYou see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.\n\nWhile many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\u2019s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.\n\nSo, you have to wonder: \u201cWhen does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\nI say now.\n\nProsperity can\u2019t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.\n\nDemocracy can\u2019t be just for billionaires and corporations.\n\nProsperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.\n\nYou brought our country back.\n\nNow it\u2019s time \u2014 your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\n\nAnd, you know what?\n\nAmerica can\u2019t succeed unless you succeed.\n\nThat is why I am running for President of the United States.\n\nHere, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.\n\nI\u2019m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.\n\nFor the successful and the struggling.\n\nFor the innovators and inventors.\n\nFor those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.\n\nFor the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.\n\nFor the nurses who work the night shift.\n\nFor the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.\n\nFor the veterans who served our country.\n\nFor the small business owners who took a risk.\n\nFor everyone who\u2019s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\n\nI\u2019m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.\n\nOur country\u2019s challenges didn\u2019t begin with the Great Recession and they won\u2019t end with the recovery.\n\nFor decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.\n\nAdvances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.\n\nThe financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value\u2026 too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.\n\nOur political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they\u2019ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.\n\nNow, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we\u2019ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.\n\nOur next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that \u2014 to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.\n\nAt our best, that\u2019s what Americans do. We\u2019re problem solvers, not deniers. We don\u2019t hide from change, we harness it.\n\nBut we can\u2019t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.\n\nAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.\n\nNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\u2019re all singing the same old song\u2026\n\nA song called \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nYou know the one \u2014 all our troubles look as though they\u2019re here to stay\u2026 and we need a place to hide away\u2026 They believe in yesterday.\n\nAnd you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try singing that, too, I\u2019ll tell you!\n\nThese Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.\n\nAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\u2019ll say: \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d Well, then, why don\u2019t they start listening to those who are?\n\nThey pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.\n\nThey want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.\n\nThey shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.\n\nThey want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.\n\nAnd they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.\n\nFundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called \u201ca village\u201d that has a place for everyone.\n\nNow, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.\n\nI believe that success isn\u2019t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty\u2026\n\nHow many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive\u2026\n\nHow many young people go to college without drowning in debt\u2026\n\nHow many people find a good job\u2026\n\nHow many families get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nI didn\u2019t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.\n\nMy mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.\n\nHer own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.\n\nYou know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.\n\nThe 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.\n\nThe woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.\n\nAnd, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.\n\nTo meet every challenge.\n\nTo be resilient\u2026 no matter what the world throws at you.\n\nTo solve the toughest problems.\n\nI believe we can do all these things because I\u2019ve seen it happen.\n\nAs a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.\n\nMy first job out of law school was for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn\u2019t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.\n\nAs a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.\n\nIn Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.\n\nAs Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9\/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.\n\nIt took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.\n\nThere are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.\n\nJust weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn\u2019t quite so hard for families like hers?\n\nI want to be her champion and your champion.\n\nIf you\u2019ll give me the chance, I\u2019ll wage and win Four Fights for you.\n\nThe first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\n\nTo make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.\n\nThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nIs this possible in today\u2019s world?\n\nI believe it is or I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\n\nDo I think it will be easy? Of course not.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can\u2019t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.\n\nThere are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.\n\nBusiness leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.\n\nThere are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.\n\nThere are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow\u2019s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\u2019ll propose specific policies to:\n\nReward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck \u2013 because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.\n\nI will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.\n\nI will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.\n\nWe will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.\n\nWe will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.\n\nAnd we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\n\nDeveloping renewable power \u2013 wind, solar, advanced biofuels\u2026\n\nBuilding cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings\u2026\n\nUsing additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment\u2026\n\nAnd ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.\n\nNow, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.\n\nWe will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.\n\nWe will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.\n\nNow, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.\n\nThat\u2019s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.\n\nAnd I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that talent is universal \u2013 you can find it anywhere \u2013 but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.\n\nOur country won\u2019t be competitive or fair if we don\u2019t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.\n\nSo let\u2019s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.\n\nLet\u2019s make college affordable and available to all \u2026and lift the crushing burden of student debt.\n\nLet\u2019s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.\n\nNow, the second fight is to strengthen America\u2019s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.\n\nAnd today\u2019s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.\n\nI believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.\n\nI believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.\n\nI believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.\n\nThat you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.\n\nI believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.\n\nAnd it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job \u2014 and women of color often making even less.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.\n\nIn America, every family should feel like they belong.\n\nSo we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.\n\nAnd, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.\n\nYou know, America\u2019s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what\u2019s drawn so many to our shores. What\u2019s inspired people all over the world. I know. I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\n\nAnd these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.\n\nSo we have a third fight: to harness all of America\u2019s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.\n\nNo other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran \u2013 and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.\n\nNo other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.\n\nAs your President, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.\n\nAnd if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.\n\nAs a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today\u2019s threats and tomorrow\u2019s.\n\nAnd when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I\u2019ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they\u2019ve earned.\n\nI\u2019ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.\n\nBut, I know \u2014 I know we have to be smart as well as strong.\n\nMeeting today\u2019s global challenges requires every element of America\u2019s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.\n\nThere are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there\u2019s a lot of good news out there too.\n\nI believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.\n\nAnd we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That\u2019s why we have to win the fourth fight \u2013 reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.\n\nWe have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.\n\nWe need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\u2019s right to vote, rather than every corporation\u2019s right to buy elections.\n\nIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nI want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.\n\nI\u2019ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.\n\nWhat part of democracy are they afraid of?\n\nNo matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.\n\nGovernment is never going to have all the answers \u2013 but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.\n\nThat means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.\n\nWe need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.\n\nTo do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I\u2019ll also stand my ground when I must.\n\nThat\u2019s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State \u2014 whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities \u2014 and it\u2019s something I will always do as your President.\n\nWe Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other\u2019s back.\n\nLike any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.\n\nPeople all over the world have asked me: \u201cHow could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?\u201d\n\nNow, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled \u2013 even killed \u2013 not hired as Secretary of State.\n\nBut President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That\u2019s how we do it in America.\n\nWith that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.\n\nWe can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.\n\nWe can strengthen our families.\n\nWe can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.\n\nAnd we can renew the promise of our democracy.\n\nIf we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.\n\nI want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.\n\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.\n\nText \u201cJOIN\u201d J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6.\n\nGo to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I\u2019m not stopping now.\n\nYou know, I know how hard this job is. I\u2019ve seen it up close and personal.\n\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.\n\nWell, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!\n\nAnd the first grandmother as well.\n\nAnd one additional advantage: You\u2019re won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\u2019ve been coloring it for years!\n\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I\u2019m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.\n\nAnd along the way, I\u2019ll just let you in on this little secret. I won\u2019t get everything right. Lord knows I\u2019ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there\u2019s no shortage of people pointing them out!\n\nAnd I certainly haven\u2019t won every battle I\u2019ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.\n\nI think you know by now that I\u2019ve been called many things by many people \u2014 \u201cquitter\u201d is not one of them.\n\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.\n\nWhen I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I\u2019d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\n\nI can still hear her saying: \u201cLife\u2019s not about what happens to you, it\u2019s about what you do with what happens to you \u2013 so get back out there.\u201d\n\nShe lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century \u2014 all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.\n\nShe was born on June 4, 1919 \u2014 before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.\n\nThe story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us \u2013 not just some, but all \u2013 should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.\n\nNot only because we\u2019re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we\u2019re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.\n\nI wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.\n\nI wish she could have seen the America we\u2019re going to build together.\n\nAn America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.\n\nWhere we don\u2019t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.\n\nAn America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.\n\nThank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.",

    "text":"Photo: Preston Gannaway\/Concord Monitor\/Polaris (Thompson); Getty Images (The White House)\n\nFred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It\u2019s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. \u201cI\u2019m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,\u201d he says as he plows toward the ballroom.\n\nInside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson\u2019s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman\u2014a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband\u2019s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.\n\nThe room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson script\u2014a bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. \u201cI was telling one of my buddies up there, \u2018You know, it\u2019s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Well, don\u2019t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.\u2019\u201d Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. \u201cAnd then he says, \u2018Thompson, you got it all covered.\u2019\u201d Everyone laughs.\n\nToday, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. \u201cWe can\u2019t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We\u2019ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can\u2019t prove they\u2019re terrorists within 24 hours, you\u2019ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain\u2019t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.\u201d\n\nSomeone shouts \u201cGo, Fred, go.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. \u201cPeople talk about the last election. They say, \u2018The war, the war, the war,\u2019\u201d Thompson says with a sigh. \u201cI think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it\u2019s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.\u201d\n\nA minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. \u201cMaybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues.\u201d The applause builds to a standing ovation. \u201cYou know, I had another comment or two,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cbut I think that\u2019s the perfect place to stop.\u201d\n\nThompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. \u201cYou know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,\u201d Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. \u201cWithout raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I\u2019ve already saved $50 million this year.\u201d Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.\n\nSince announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson\u2019s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn\u2019t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.\n\nPhoto: Daily News\n\nSo far, the Thompson bubble has floated skyward on several favorable updrafts. He\u2019s the newest man in the race\u2014and one with celebrity name recognition. He\u2019s a Southerner and arguably the most conservative candidate in a field devoid of hard-liners. Despite his eight years in the Senate, people seem to buy the idea, for the time being anyway, that he\u2019s a Washington outsider. And all of his opponents have significant liabilities. But then again, so does Thompson. Among them are his work ethic and authenticity.\n\nThompson is often compared to Ronald Reagan, not just because they are both actors, but also because of each man\u2019s almost preternatural affability. But Reagan was an unalloyed ideologue when America was looking for one, with eight years as the chief executive of what amounts to one of the world\u2019s largest countries. He wasn\u2019t elected until his third campaign, when he defeated a weak Democratic incumbent. Fred Thompson is in a different place. If he\u2019s going to be elected the leader of the Free World, he may have to do it on the strength of his not inconsiderable personal charm.\n\nYou can\u2019t get to Fred Thompson\u2019s hometown from here. Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is located 28 miles from the nearest interstate. Its rolling hills are picturesquely dotted with pigs and cattle, but it remains one of the state\u2019s poorest areas. \u201cThis town hasn\u2019t been the same since the Yankees came in and opened the Murray bike factory,\u201d says Tommy Beuerlein, who owns a downtown pharmacy and was a classmate of Thompson\u2019s. The bike factory arrived in 1955. \u201cNixon was right about there being a silent majority in America,\u201d Beuerlein proudly says. \u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d\n\nOn a recent summer day, eighteen people attended a city-council meeting dealing with the local problem of illegal dumping of couches. A few steps away, 71 residents, some of them as young as 9, attended a shotgun-safety class. \u201cYou have to respect your zone of fire,\u201d insisted the instructor. \u201cVice-President Cheney didn\u2019t respect his zone of fire, and look what happened.\u201d\n\nMuch of Thompson\u2019s down-home affability can be attributed to his roots in Lawrenceburg, where as a child he pretended to be Western star Lash LaRue and courted his high-school sweetheart underneath the town\u2019s Davy Crockett statue (true story). But while Thompson may be a country boy, he\u2019s a certain type of country boy: the one who plays possum while you mock his cornpone ways. Next thing you know he\u2019s got your girl and holds the deed to your farm.\n\nThompson\u2019s father, Fletch, ran a used-car lot in the center of town, and would talk Republican politics at the Blue Ribbon Caf\u00e9. Neither of Thompson\u2019s parents attended high school (his father eventually earned a GED), and Fred, the first of two sons, proved to be an indifferent but popular student. Even as a kid, Fred had a flair for showmanship. One of the building blocks of the Thompson legend is the story of his concerned football coach\u2019s running onto the field to check on an injured Thompson. When coach Garner Ezell reached his player, Thompson smiled at his fellow Church of Christ parishioner and quipped, \u201cHow\u2019s the crowd takin\u2019 it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFred said it,\u201d says Ezell. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t ever hurt. He was just tired and wanted a rest.\u201d\n\nEven a blind squirrel sometimes finds a nut, and Thompson has always seemed to have a way of stumbling into success. By all accounts, Thompson\u2019s work ethic kicked in at 17, when he got his sweetheart Sarah Lindsey pregnant and immediately proposed. \u201cI barely got out of high school,\u201d Thompson told the Washington Post in 1985. \u201cI was interested in two things\u2014and sports was one of them.\u201d\n\nBecause of his marriage, Thompson didn\u2019t play sports his senior year, and he put in long shifts at the bike factory to support his new family. The following fall, the newlyweds headed to nearby Florence State, now the University of North Alabama, before transferring to Memphis State, from which they both graduated. Sarah\u2019s grandfather was an influential Lawrenceburg lawyer, and her family urged Thompson to apply to Vanderbilt Law School. After graduating, the couple moved back to Lawrenceburg, and Thompson practiced law with Sarah\u2019s uncle and began dabbling in local GOP politics, eventually joining the county\u2019s Republican Executive Committee. It was through that group that Thompson caught the eye of another accidental benefactor, Tennessee senator Howard Baker. Thompson worked on Baker\u2019s 1972 reelection, sometimes driving the senator around Tennessee, and the two men struck up a friendship.\n\nBy the next year, Watergate was everywhere. And while Yale and Harvard up-and-comers like Hillary Clinton and Bill Weld clawed for minor legal positions, Baker offered Thompson a coveted slot as minority counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee.\n\nPhoto: Brett Flashnick\/AP\n\nIn 1975, Thompson wrote about the experience in his book At That Point in Time: The Inside Story of the Senate Watergate Committee, portraying himself as the picture of the awestruck country lawyer. He insists when Baker offered him the job in February of 1973, \u201cthe only names I could recall without prompting were Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy.\u201d\n\nBecause it was a Republican investigator who had uncovered the fact that Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield had admitted that the White House featured an elaborate taping system, Baker insisted that a Republican cross-examine Butterfield the next day so the GOP could maintain the illusion of impartiality\u2014and take credit. On national television, Thompson asked Butterfield the now famous line, \u201cAre you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?\u201d Butterfield famously answered yes (as everyone already knew he would). It was Thompson\u2019s first star turn, a role that marked him in America\u2019s minds as a righteous heavyweight prosecutor.\n\nThompson\u2019s own book suggests he wasn\u2019t exactly an impartial participant in the proceedings, however. He admits to leaking the news about the Butterfield discovery to Nixon\u2019s lawyers without authorization. Transcripts from the Nixon Tapes also suggest Thompson was at least partially in Nixon\u2019s pocket. As the Watergate Committee prepared to call Nixon aide John Dean, Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt coached Thompson on how to question Dean. Buzhardt told Nixon, \u201cI found Thompson most cooperative, feeling more Republican every day.\u201d The next day, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig reported to the president, \u201cHe [Thompson] thinks we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d Of course, they were not. Not long after, Dean became the first Nixon aide to directly tie the president to the break-in and cover-up. But Thompson\u2019s reputation as a plain-speaking crusader for truth and justice had already been made.\n\nThompson\u2019s acting career also happened by accident. After parlaying his Watergate fame into big speaking fees and the start of a lucrative lobbying career (his clients included Westinghouse and the Tennessee savings-and-loans industry), Thompson returned to private practice in Tennessee. There, he wound up representing Marie Ragghianti, the head of the Tennessee Parole Board who was fired by Democratic governor Ray Blanton for exposing a parole-for-sale scheme. Ragghianti sued for wrongful dismissal, and Thompson won the case. Serpico author Peter Maas wrote a book about Ragghianti\u2019s story that was eventually optioned as a movie with Sissy Spacek slated to play the title role.\n\nAccording to Thompson lore, director Roger Donaldson had to plead with Thompson to audition to play himself. \u201cThe idea of him playing himself was reached,\u201d Donaldson told the Nashville Tennessean in May of this year. \u201cAnd so I said to Fred, \u2018Would you be interested at having a go at playing yourself?\u2019 He was like, \u2018Shucks, do you think I could do that?\u2019 I said, \u2018You never know until you try.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, back in 1985, when the movie was made, Thompson freely admitted he\u2019d lobbied Donaldson hard until he scored an audition. Although the film wasn\u2019t especially successful, Thompson received raves, including one that described him as the movie\u2019s \u201creal discovery.\u201d\n\nBored with the law and in the process of getting a divorce from Lindsey, Thompson started work on a novel and began going on auditions. The book was never published, but within a few years, Thompson had become a Hollywood go-to guy for gruff government types, eventually playing a CIA director in No Way Out and a navy admiral in The Hunt for Red October. Most of his parts didn\u2019t take long to film, so Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game. Tennessee insiders tried to persuade Thompson to run for the retiring Baker\u2019s seat in 1984, but he declined, quipping to the Washington Post, \u201cthe hassle factor is up and the pay is not.\u201d\n\nThe day after his South Carolina speech in June, Thompson headed to New Hampshire for a bit of packaged politicking to be chronicled by the home team. With rare exceptions, Thompson has limited his media exposure to reliably conservative outlets like The Weekly Standard, Sean Hannity, and Fox News. This morning, Fox had the exclusive.\n\nThe first stop was Riley\u2019s gun shop, the largest rifle-and-pistol joint in New Hampshire. A few minutes after noon, two black SUVs barreled down the two-lane blacktop and were waved into the parking lot by a Thompson aide. The cars emptied, and Thompson emerged with Jeri. Thompson\u2019s blue suit was a torrent of wrinkles\u2014he conjured up \u201960 Nixon more than \u201980 Reagan. His better half looked, well, better in a smart black suit that seemed a slight bit of overkill for a gun-and-ammo stop. They held hands and walked up a wheelchair-accessible ramp into Riley\u2019s, where two or three customers idly chatted with the help about the stability of this or that rifle scope.\n\nPhoto: JP Laffont\/Sygma\/Corbis\n\nThompson glanced around at the 4,000 guns, and strode toward an employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into your record, and I\u2019m really looking forward to you getting into the race,\u201d said Robert Brown, a 34-year-old salesman. Thompson beamed, pumped his hand, and told him, \u201cWe need to get back to basics.\u201d\n\nFred and Jeri then made a loop of the store, pausing before a glass display case that could be used to showcase engagement rings. Here at Riley\u2019s, it housed a dozen glimmering Saturday night specials. Thompson lovingly nudged his spouse and tilted his noggin toward a coal-black .38 Smith & Wesson and cooed, \u201cHoney, would you like one of those?\u201d\n\nOn the way out, I tried again to get Thompson to veer off-script. I jokingly asked him if he had more experience hunting than does Romney, who had been lampooned for saying he hunted varmints. As in a bad movie, time stopped for a second as I realized I\u2019d just set foot on a land mine of my own laying. Jeri beamed, and Fred halted his walk back to the car. He shot a look at the camera crews\u2014Fox had sent two\u2014and waited a second for everyone to settle in again. This is why they made the visit: It was time to contrast the man\u2019s man Thompson with his effete competitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a little different eating habits,\u201d joked Thompson. \u201cI\u2019ve hunted pheasants, and I like to skeet shoot. We\u2019d hold a celebrity skeet-shooting contest in Washington, raise money for juvenile diabetes. Now, I\u2019ve held it, I\u2019ve never won it. They couldn\u2019t slow those things down enough for me.\u201d\n\nThe Fox crew nodded appreciatively. A moment later, the SUVs peeled away. The whole stop lasted far shorter than an episode of Law & Order, and was just as well-directed.\n\nThompson changed his mind about the Senate in 1993, when Al Gore was elected vice-president and his seat became open. Thompson\u2019s opponent was Congressman Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat and the son of a former governor. At first, the candidates projected similar images of dark-suited blandness. \u201cI remember an early event at the Peabody hotel in Memphis,\u201d says Mike Kopp, Cooper\u2019s press secretary. \u201cCooper was a black hole of charisma: He didn\u2019t have any, and he\u2019d suck up yours. But Fred didn\u2019t come across as exactly electric.\u201d\n\nIn May 1994, Thompson trailed badly and talked of quitting. Frustrated, he called Knoxville political consultant Tom Ingram, who had masterminded Lamar Alexander\u2019s 1978 election as Tennessee governor. Alexander wasn\u2019t Mr. Personality either, but he caught fire when Ingram put him in a plaid shirt and had him walk across the state (a tactic, it\u2019s worth noting, that later bombed when Alexander ran for president). Thompson and Ingram met at a Cracker Barrel restaurant halfway between Nashville and Knoxville. \u201cHe was talking of getting out, and I asked him how\u2019d he want to do this,\u201d remembers Ingram. \u201cFred said, \u2018Just driving around talking to people.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s get you a truck and do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough some of his campaign staff protested the move as cheesy, they leased Thompson a red Chevy pickup and he hit the road. Cooper attempted to paint Thompson as phony, calling him a \u201cGucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Poupon\u2013spreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist.\u201d But voters loved the truck. They didn\u2019t seem to mind that the candidate often switched from a sedan to the truck just miles from his appearances. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe anyone was buying it,\u201d says Kopp. \u201cWe underestimated him. What we didn\u2019t get is that Fred is the country version of a street kid. He\u2019s been talking his way out of situations since he was in high school. He\u2019s a charmer. People fall for it.\u201d\n\nKopp and Ingram are friends, and Kopp expresses admiration for the consultant\u2019s work. \u201cFred Thompson was miscast at the beginning of the race,\u201d Kopp says. \u201cSo Tom just recast the role, and Fred Thompson played it perfectly.\u201d\n\nIngram disagrees. \u201cThe reason the truck worked is that that is Fred Thompson. Gimmicks fail in campaigns all the time because they don\u2019t ring true. Yeah, Fred is a lawyer and an actor, but he is also a country guy. People sense that.\u201d\n\nThompson ended up winning by twenty points, partially aided by the Gingrich sweep of 1994. He drove the red truck to Washington where his old boss Baker threw a raucous party for him. According to The Washington Monthly, a gleeful Thompson mentioned that the craziness made him think of the party his fellow Tennessean Andrew Jackson had at the White House on the night of his inauguration.\n\n\u201cOne office at a time,\u201d cautioned Baker.\n\nA few hours after the Riley\u2019s stop in Manchester, Thompson reappeared for a fund-raiser at Bedford\u2019s Wayfarer Inn, a hotel known for decades as a base for reporters boozing their way through the New Hampshire primaries. On this 90-degree summer scorcher, the air-conditioning in the small conference room where Thompson was supposed to greet high rollers was on the fritz. Not even Jeri\u2019s perky smile and repeated recanting of \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jeri, and I\u2019m your official greeter tonight\u201d could relieve the torpor.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, Thompson emerged, covered in sweat and looking dangerously gray. For a moment, a \u201cWhat the hell have I got myself into?\u201d look crossed his face. There was another, less exclusive fund-raiser just down the hall, packed with TV cameras (the Fox exclusive had been lifted), but Thompson bargained for some down time. \u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t look like a man in game shape.\n\nTwenty minutes later, a car drove him to the other side of the hotel, either to make his entrance grander or to save him the two-minute walk. After a brief introduction, Thompson took the microphone and talked about terrorism. He spoke in a reassuring, fatherly voice. \u201cWe\u2019re confronted with a group of people who killed thousands of our people and would like nothing more than to get their hands on technology to kill millions,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ready to resume a war that\u2019s been going on for hundreds of years, and they have another hundred-year plan. Some of our leaders got a plan for the next election,\u201d he continued, presumably referring to those leaders who want to pull out of Iraq. \u201cAnd they think they can win votes out of it.\u201d As a policy idea, it wasn\u2019t what one would call a breakthrough, nor was it much of an applause line. When Thompson talks about issues, his speeches tend to lose focus and drift.\n\nBut when the speech ended and the music blared, Thompson got in the Country Fred groove. He was doing the walk and talk, where he is most successful. \u201cKeep your powder dry,\u201d Thompson told his fans. He paused mid-mob to answer a Franklin Pierce College poli-sci student\u2019s question about entitlements. This time it was a TV reporter who ventured an unsanctioned question, asking Thompson whether he was a lazy man. Thompson didn\u2019t get angry; he just laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said about me before I ran the first time, and that\u2019s what they said about me two years later,\u201d he replied. \u201cI won the first time by twenty points, and 21 points the second time. If you can do that while being lazy, I recommend it to everyone.\u201d\n\nthe greatest testament to the power of Fred Thompson\u2019s down-home likability might be that his Senate years were widely viewed as a train wreck, yet he emerged not only unscathed but also as a presidential contender.\n\nThings started auspiciously enough. Because Thompson had been elected to fill Gore\u2019s unexpired term, he was sworn in a month before other freshmen senators on December 9, 1994. Republicans didn\u2019t waste any time putting the actor in front of the cameras. On December 15, Thompson gave the Republicans\u2019 response to President Clinton\u2019s budget address. Thompson spoke for only five minutes, but he struck a chord. A STAR IS BORN read the headline of Frank Rich\u2019s New York Times column.\n\nBut that would be the high point. Thompson spent the next two years accomplishing almost nothing of significance other than raising money for his 1996 reelection: Thompson brought back the red truck and won in a walk.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton easily trounced Bob Dole in that year\u2019s presidential race, allegations surfaced that the Chinese government had funneled money into the Clinton campaign and that Al Gore had attended a fund-raiser at a Los Angeles Buddhist temple financed by foreign nationals. Thompson, chairman of the previously backwaterish Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which had jurisdiction, called for hearings.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the hearings that July, the papers were filled with stories of Thompson\u2019s Watergate role and his prosecutorial flair. The Democrats\u2019 ranking minority member was John Glenn, and the conventional wisdom was that Thompson would charm the octogenarian into submission. It didn\u2019t happen. Thompson condescended to Glenn and alienated members of his own party. When New Hampshire Republican Bob Smith announced in his opening statement, \u201cIt is probably the biggest scandal in the history of the Republic,\u201d Thompson turned to the Democratic side, rolled his eyes, and muttered, \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Thompson donated his Senate papers to the University of Tennessee. Some of his archives are filled with notes of off-the-record interviews Thompson conducted with reporters during his Senate years. In his papers, Thompson complains about the trouble he had managing his colleagues during the 1996 hearings. He speaks of \u201cmembers on your [own] side, grilling your team to a point where [you have to] get them to a room, woodshed them, [on] how to ask questions, how to proceed.\u201d\n\nThompson was also accused of grandstanding, and his relationship with then Republican Senate leaders Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell quickly soured. Soon Thompson was warring with both sides. \u201c[We have] presidents at fund-raisers, Lott [saying] raising money is the American Way, [and] McConnell [is the] Darth Vader of Reform,\u201d Thompson says in one of the off-the-record sessions found in his archives.\n\nThompson\u2019s hearings grew even more unpopular with his own party when he diverted the proceedings to the subject of campaign-finance reform (Senate Republicans opposed such reform for fear of losing hard-won fund-raising advantages). Lott was furious, and Thompson suspected the majority leader was the anonymous author of quotes criticizing the hearings.\n\nThe senator further angered conservatives by becoming an early supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. Although Thompson has recently tried to minimize his enthusiasm for the bill, his Senate papers include a handwritten note from Senator Russell Feingold after the measure passed the Senate in 2001 reading, \u201cYou were essential to our success from the outset!\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s Senate years also featured a level of sympathy for Bill Clinton that conservatives don\u2019t tend to share. In 1995, Thompson\u2019s archives show, he sent Clinton a note after the State of the Union address that partially read, \u201cThe speech probably would not have seemed so long to some of us if you hadn\u2019t been putting the wood to us so effectively.\u201d Thompson\u2019s 1999 split vote on Clinton\u2019s two counts of impeachment squared with one of his off-the-record sessions in 1998, when he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m prejudiced in his favor, I object to the tactics used against him.\u201d This didn\u2019t stop Thompson from sending Kenneth Starr a congratulations letter at the end of the Clinton saga.\n\nThompson may blast colleagues for not draining the Washington swamp, but he did his share of feeding the alligators. His papers include ingratiating notes to George Will, Arianna Huffington, and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. There\u2019s a mash note from Bruce Willis (\u201cYou were great in Die Hard\u201d) and a letter from Oliver Stone thanking Thompson for brokering an interview with Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray.\n\nThompson\u2019s off-the-record chats with reporters also suggest that his claim that he hasn\u2019t given much thought to running for president might be somewhat disingenuous (his campaign has attempted to make a virtue of the fact that Thompson, unlike his competitors, isn\u2019t obsessed with power). During one 1998 off-the-record bull session, Thompson boasted to a reporter, \u201cAl Gore goes to bed at night and says, \u2018Please don\u2019t let it be Fred Dalton Thompson.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a senator and movie star of a certain age, Thompson was a steadily sought-after D.C. bachelor. He alternately dated Lorrie Morgan, a five-times-married country-music star, Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, former Time columnist Margaret Carlson, and Washington socialite Georgette Mosbacher. \u201cI chased a lot of women, and a lot of women chased me,\u201d Thompson told Republican congressmen earlier this year. \u201cAnd those that chased me tended to catch me.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s relationships with the Washington elite, romantic and otherwise, have paid significant dividends. This March, Carlson talked up Thompson\u2019s presidential possibilities on MSNBC, rhapsodizing, \u201cHe\u2019s handsome, he\u2019s charming, he sounds like a president, and he looks like a president.\u201d She didn\u2019t disclose their prior personal relationship.\n\nThompson scored more gravitas points last month when Washington Post columnist and socialite Sally Quinn breathlessly wrote that Vice-President Dick Cheney was on his way out and should be replaced by, yes, Fred Thompson. \u201cEverybody loves Fred,\u201d Quinn wrote. \u201cHe has the healing qualities of Gerald Ford and the movie-star appeal of Ronald Reagan.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, they both appeared in the 1994 remake of Born Yesterday.\n\nTalking about his Senate years in July, Thompson said, \u201cWhen I served eight years, I left. I was following George Washington\u2019s model of serving eight years, getting on his horse, and never coming back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only partially true. After 9\/11, Thompson announced he would seek reelection the next year. But in January 2002, Thompson\u2019s daughter Betsy died of an accidental drug overdose, ending a long, troubled life. In March, Thompson withdrew his candidacy and sharply criticized the media coverage of Betsy\u2019s death. \u201cI simply do not have the heart for another six years,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nA few months before he left office, Thompson received a call. This time, his career angel was Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, who offered him the role of Arthur Branch over the phone. He immediately accepted. Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game in 2004 by taking on Equitas Ltd., a British reinsurer responsible for paying out millions in asbestos claims. Equitas wanted Senate legislation that would limit its liability and paid Thompson $760,000 over the next three years. He also serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and in 2005 help shepherd Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts through his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIn 2002, Thompson married Jeri. The couple met in 1995 (Jeri was a Republican spokesperson at the time) on the Nashville yacht of Dale Gish, on the Fourth of July. Their relationship was on and off for years, with Kehn memorably complaining about other rivals to the New York Post in 2000. \u201cThey just won\u2019t leave him alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get up to get a cocktail at a party without coming back and finding some girl sitting in my chair.\u201d Fred and Jeri have since had two children, Hayden and an 8-month-old son named Samuel.\n\nLast November, Thompson said he wouldn\u2019t run for president, telling a political dinner-party gathering, \u201cI would have had to start two years ago if I was going to run. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever want to jump back in.\u201d\n\nBut with Giuliani, McCain, and Romney appearing vulnerable, Howard Baker began making calls around Washington to gauge the interest for a late-entering telegenic southern senator.\n\nOr so the story goes. Some Republican insiders say it is Jeri who is fanning Thompson\u2019s presidential aspirations. While Ingram won\u2019t confirm that, he does say Jeri played an influential role in the handling of her husband\u2019s April announcement that he had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but is now in remission. The move was seen as a way of clearing the decks for a Thompson presidential run. \u201cHe relies on her,\u201d Ingram says. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely partners.\u201d\n\nTo some, Jeri has already become a target. MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough mused, \u201cYou think she works the pole?\u201d and the New York Times \u201cStyles\u201d section raised the question of whether America was ready for a trophy-wife First Lady.\n\nAfter getting the high sign from Thompson, Ingram began talking up a Thompson candidacy on Capitol Hill, where Ingram now works as Lamar Alexander\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cI was at the Capitol Hill Club at Bill Hecht\u2019s table,\u201d recalls Ingram, name-dropping the presence of a prominent Republican lobbyist. \u201cCongressmen and lobbyists were coming up to me, and they were all really excited. It\u2019s the closest thing to a presidential draft in my lifetime,\u201d Ingram insists. I asked him whether the well-heeled well-wishers were familiar with Thompson from his Senate days. He hemmed and hawed a bit. \u201cWell no, they mostly know him more from Law & Order than the Senate, but Fred\u2019s not acting on the show. That\u2019s exactly the way Fred was in his Senate office.\u201d\n\nNow comes the hard part. With Thompson all but officially in the race, the media has begun training its sights on his backside. First, the Times dissected the political-consulting careers of Thompson\u2019s two sons and mentioned the payments totaling $170,000 from Thompson\u2019s political action committee to his son Daniel. Then Thompson\u2019s previously noble Watergate image took a hit in the Boston Globe when Scott Armstrong, a man Thompson had labeled a leaker 30 years ago, exacted a measure of revenge by calling Thompson a Nixon \u201cmole.\u201d\n\nThe most damaging allegation was a Los Angeles Times story claiming that Thompson lobbied the first Bush White House in 1991 on behalf of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, a pro-choice organization. At first, Thompson\u2019s people denied it. Then they said he didn\u2019t remember it. On day three, Sean Hannity, quickly becoming Thompson\u2019s Boswell, offered the senator an opportunity to explain himself. Thompson replied, \u201cIn the first place, you need to separate a lawyer advocating a position for the position itself.\u201d The answer may have been factually correct, but it came across as the kind of dissembling voters\u2014especially conservative ones, in this case\u2014despise.\n\nMeanwhile, Thompson pushed back his official announcement from early to late July and now, perhaps, to after Labor Day. All of this only sharpened the lingering question of whether Thompson is up for the job. He\u2019s also got to raise millions and build a campaign team in a hurry.\n\nThompson\u2019s supporters point to his folksy charm, which they insist will play especially well in key southern and midwestern swing states. And the lack of anyone to the right of Thompson, however imperfect he may be as a conservative, means that the party base will ultimately be forced to back him, they say.\n\nBut Thompson\u2019s strongest card, his backers say, is his Hollywood-fueled image of strength. \u201cPeople think that with presidential candidates, you need a lot of information about them,\u201d says Tony Fabrizio, a GOP pollster not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s all about the concept. He has the Schwarzenegger Factor. Just like it\u2019s impossible to make Schwarzenegger look weak because people see him as the Terminator, voters see Fred as the tough-talking D.A. or the captain in Hunt for Red October. It\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\nThose are the rational arguments. Fred Thompson is counting on something a little more visceral.\n\nOn July 10, Thompson made a last-minute trip to suburban Atlanta for the omnipresent Sean Hannity\u2019s Freedom Concert, a fund-raiser for Oliver North\u2019s scholarship fund that benefits the sons and daughters of service personnel killed in action.\n\nBeforehand, there was a meet and greet for supporters at the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce. Thompson took exactly one question and shrugged when I asked him about the impact of the recent media attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any arrows,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking a page from his dress-casual Senate campaigns, Thompson wore a camel-colored sport jacket, an open-necked shirt, slacks, and brown loafers. He thanked his supporters for turning out on short notice and pledged, \u201cWe\u2019re playing by our own rules.\u201d He touched on the well-grooved themes of competence and the \u201cshenanigans in Washington,\u201d but today he struck a more acutely patriotic chord. \u201cA lot of smart people have looked at the history books and said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s been a pretty good run. Lots of civilizations have lasted a little longer, but they all declined and got fat and happy and sassy and weak. And they all just faded into the sunset.\u2019\u201d Thompson was working the room without a microphone and spoke quietly and even slower than usual. \u201cThat is not going to happen on our watch.\u201d You could practically hear the martial music.\n\nAfter posing for pictures, Thompson was ushered next door to the Gwinnett Arena, where 12,000 people were gathered. Hannity opened the show with a Hillary imitator getting off gems like \u201cMy husband moved from the White House to Harlem. Of course, he read the map wrong and thought it said \u2018Harem.\u2019\u201d The party faithful pounded their hands in approval but quieted for the pledge of allegiance.\n\nAfter the Christian rock band Avalon performed, Thompson was introduced. He read a patriotic poem about the war, took his bows, then sat down in the audience and watched with rapt excitement as the comedian Larry the Cable Guy glided through a set. \u201cMy doctor told me I had to give up eggs,\u201d said Larry, tugging at his trucker cap. \u201cI said, \u2018Why, because of my cholesterol?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, your farts are killing us.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe arena echoed with laughter. Over in his seat, Thompson slapped his thigh and gave an \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2019cause it\u2019s true\u201d full-body shake. He seemed to be having the time of his life. It is hard to imagine Rudy or Romney, Hillary or Barack, sitting through the set, much less soaking it all in.\n\nThe fashionable book in high-level political circles these days, the one the candidates and their staffs have been talking about, is The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation by Drew Westen. The central idea is that voters don\u2019t make rational calculations about a candidate and his positions. They vote for the person they just plain like. Fred Thompson\u2019s best hope is that Westen is right.",

    "text":"WASHINGTON\n\nSENATORS say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them.\n\nOn Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms \u2014 a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count.\n\nSome of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died.

I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither.

But could rising prices,revolution, and a nuclear disaster kill the recovery? And as partisanbickering meets the bloated budget, will the government shut downlater this week?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. MIKE PENCE R-IND.: I say, shut it down.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Two top senators join us for a This Week debate.\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, This Week startsright now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome to the program. Right now, the Middle East isfalling further into chaos, violence and uncertainty as the UnitedStates grapples with fresh challenges in two of its three wars.President Obama, who ran as the anti-war candidate, now finds himselfstruggling to defend new American military action overseas, while therapidly changing situations in Libya, Afghanistan, and across theMiddle East pose new threats to U.S. security and credibility.\n\nI'll be talking to my colleagues Mike Boettcher and Nick Schifrinin Afghanistan, and Jeffrey Kaufman and Alex Marquardt on the frontlines in Libya.\n\nLet's turn first to Afghanistan, where a firefight along thePakistan border brought one of the deadliest days for American troopsin months, and where the battle for hearts and minds may have beenvirtually erased overnight at the hands of a fringe pastor in Florida.\n\nAfter months of threatening to burn a copy of the Koran, PastorTerry Jones and his handful of followers finally did just that. Thisdeliberately provocative act received little media attention here inthe United States, but it did spread like wildfire online. And withindays, protests in Afghanistan turned deadly.\n\nABC's Mike Boettcher is embedded with the 101st AirborneDivision. Mike was the lone reporter on that bloody six-day offensivealong the border.\n\nMike, how bad was that?\n\nMIKE BOETTCHER, ABC CORRESPONDENT: In 30 years of covering war,I have never seen such withering fire. And soldiers who have beendeployed four or five times will tell you the same thing.\n\nA high price was paid. Six U.S. soldiers were killed. Six werewounded. Two Afghan national army were killed. And seven Afghanswere wounded in this battle, and the battle continues as we speak,right now.\n\nThis is a significant engagement because it marks a turning pointor a change in strategy along the Pakistan border where bases havebeen closed in recent months, small combat outposts. The U.S. nowsays that they're taking a more mobile strategy, going to areas theyhaven't been before, and going after the Taliban. They're going tocarry this through, through the spring and summer and expect to seevery heavy fighting in the east part of the country in the comingyear. Christiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Meantime, in cities across Afghanistan today, morescenes of rage and violence in response to that Florida pastor'sdecision to burn a Koran. The situation does present a grave newproblem for the United States. And ABC's Nick Schifrin joins me nowfrom Kabul.\n\nNick, today, General Petraeus had to come out and specificallycondemn the burning of that Koran. How bad is it there?\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've seen threeprotests three days in a row now, massive protests, 8,000 miles awayfrom that Koran-burning. Today thousands of Afghans in the streets ofsouthern Afghanistan and eastern Afghanistan, they were burning U.S.flags and chanting \"death to President Obama.\"\n\nNow David Petraeus came out with that statement today, but thereis one good piece of news. The Afghan police did not shoot into thecrowds like they did yesterday. On Friday, they were supposed to bethe first line of defense around a U.N. building where seven U.N.workers were killed. They were not able to keep those workers -- keepthose protesters out of that U.N. building.\n\nAnd U.S. officials are deeply concerned about that, because theplace where that happened, Mazar-i-Sharif, is the first city that issupposed to transfer to Afghan control, to transfer to Afghan policecontrol in three months.\n\nAnd U.S. and U.N. officials are worried that this incident is asign that the police aren't ready to take control -- Christiane. AMANPOUR: Nick, thank you. And obviously we'll keep monitoringthat situation.\n\nAnd now we turn to Libya. America's newest war is entering itsthird week of bombing, and still there is no sign that Colonel Gadhafiis stepping down. And now more bad news for the makeshift rebelforces. NATO warplanes seem to have mistakenly bombed one of theirconvoys. Another blow in a week where they've seen most of theirgains against Gadhafi wiped out.\n\nJust Monday, the rebels were within striking distance ofcapturing Gadhafi's home town of Sirt. And they had the capitalTripoli in their sites. But by week's end, they were beating a hastyretreat with Gadhafi forces once again in control of the long stretchof coastline.\n\nOur reporters in Libya have been tracking all of this. JeffreyKaufman just arrived in Tripoli, and Alex Marquardt joins us from therebel bastion of Benghazi. Let's start with Jeffrey.\n\nJeffrey, in Tripoli, any signs of the tension or that maybeGadhafi is on his last few days?\n\nJEFFREY KAUFMAN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, actually, just momentsago we heard a NATO warplane flying above us. We didn't hear anybombs dropping. But, you know, it's actually remarkably normal here.You can see the traffic behind me on the highway.\n\nAs we came in, we saw a lot of military checkpoints, long linesfor gasoline, a lot of shops closed. But the tension is not palpableat this point. The rebels are clearly on the retreat. Really, whatwe're seeing now in Libya is a divided country, almost two countries:the rebel-held east and the Gadhafi-held west.\n\nAnd neither one seems to have the strength right now to unseatthe other. Certainly the rebels aren't organized enough, mannedenough, or skilled enough to come to Tripoli. And Gadhafi, it seems,the coalition will not let him go further east and retake thosevaluable oil fields in those areas.\n\nSo right now the word to describe this revolution, weeks into it,is stalemate -- Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: Jeffrey, thank you. You mentioned stalemate and alsodivided country. And joining me now from the rebel-held city ofBenghazi is ABC's Alex Marquardt.\n\nAlex, how are these rebels dealing with being unable to reallycapitalize on all of the help the no-fly zone is giving them?\n\nALEX MARQUARDT, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Christiane, they're not ableto capitalize because they are outmanned, they are outgunned, and theyare not able to organize. They don't have the weapons to faceGadhafi's superior firepower. So they're forced to beat a retreat.\n\nThey don't have any sort of leadership. So when they retreat,they do so in a disorganized fashion, very quickly, no one showingthem how to hold the line, how to retreat.\n\nSo we're seeing now glimmers of hope that they'll be able toorganize. Experienced officers on the frontlines trying to corralthese groups into units, keeping people back without any sort oftraining.\n\nAnd for the first time on the frontlines on Friday we saw thegeneral who is technically in charge of these forces, General AbdelFattah Yunis, welcomed with a hero's welcome. So signs that there issome leadership coming to the frontlines that is so desperately neededby these rebels.\n\nAMANPOUR: Alex, thank you so much.\n\nRarely has a president faced a foreign policy puzzle thiscomplex. President Obama, of course, came into office pledging torepair America's relationship with the Muslim world. Now thatrelationship is tested like never before. Joining me to discuss thepath forward, the president's former national security adviser,General Jim Jones. He's now a senior fellow at the Bipartisan PolicyCenter.\n\nThank you for joining us.\n\nJONES: Thank you, Christiane. Good to be here.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's first talk about Afghanistan, since that seemsto be a real crisis again at the moment. This pastor who burned theKoran, is unrepentant. Do you think despite the freedoms envisionedand expressed specifically in the American Constitution, he should nothave burned that Koran?\n\nJONES: Oh, I don't think he should have done that at all. Ithink it's extremely irresponsible, and look at what it has led to.\n\nAMANPOUR: You also heard Mike Boettcher's report, a fiercefirefight along the Pakistani border, one of the worst that theAmericans had been involved in. Right now, do you think the UnitedStates forces can pull down significantly in July?\n\nJONES: Well, I think that there can be and there will be somereduction of force in keeping with the agreement made at Portugal atthe NATO summit in December to target 2014 as, in President Karzai'sown words at the London Conference, \"This is when I want to be able tocontrol my entire country.\"\n\nAMANPOUR: But can it be done responsibly, if you'd like?\n\nJONES: Yes, I think so. I think it can be done responsibly.And we'll have to see what it looks like. A lot of it hinges on whathappens on the other side of the border with our friends, the -- ourneighbors the Pakistanis.\n\nIf Pakistan turns to what some of us think they should have donemore effectively for a long period of time now, attacking and removingthose safe havens that cause us so much difficulties, and if we canget some sort of coordination with their forces, then I think you canin fact...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: You say if. You don't seem convinced that they'replaying their part.\n\nJONES: Well, I don't -- I'm not convinced. I think there wassome good progress made in the Swat Valley and in North Waziristan ayear or so ago. But it hasn't been sustained. There still seems tobe that reluctance to engage comprehensively and buy into an overallplan that would, I think, really help Pakistan in the long term.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. General Jones, stay with us because upnext we will talk about Libya. Will Libya become Obama's Iraq, assome are now suggesting? And it's a question you'll hear more andmore in the coming days. I will ask General Jones if he sees an endin sight.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROBERT GATES, DEFENSE SECRETARY: There will be no American bootson the ground in Libya. Deposing the Gadhafi regime, as welcome asthat eventuality would be, is not part of the military mission.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Defense Secretary Robert Gates testifying on CapitolHill Thursday. He is on the record saying that stopping the violencein Libya is not a vital national interest of the United States. ButAmerica is in the game now. And the big questions, for how long? Andto what end? Let's bring back retired General Jim Jones, who wasPresident Obama's first national security adviser.\n\nWelcome back again. On Libya, Secretary Gates has said on thisprogram and on several last week, that it was not in the vitalinterest of the United States. Do you agree?\n\nJONES: I agree with that.\n\nAMANPOUR: You agree that it's not in the vital interest?\n\nJONES: I agree that it's not a vital interest in the sense thatit affects the security -- the vital security of the nation. But weare part of an alliance. We are one of the global leaders, if not theglobal leader. And we have to do -- it is in the vital interest --more in the vital interest of Europeans, when you consider the effectsof massive immigration, the effects of terror, the effects of the oilmarket.\n\nAMANPOUR: So the United States is now in it. You can call itwhat you want. But it's a third armed conflict.\n\nJONES: We're a part of it. We are transitioning to a supportingpart, only the United States could have gotten there as quickly as itdid.\n\nAMANPOUR: The United States is making a great fanfare about nowgiving over to NATO. But you were a former SACEUR, a former NATOcommander. NATO, to all intents and purposes, is an Americanorganization. It's run by an American commander. The chain ofcommand is American. The biggest command and control and resourcesare American. This is still an American-led operation, right?\n\nJONES: I'm not sure I completely agree with that. We have, youknow, in the sorties that are being flown now, as I understand it,it's roughly 50-50. And it's going to go down to where the Americansare going to be supporting and reconnaissance, search and rescue,intelligence, refueling, things like that.\n\nThere are 40-some-odd ships off the coast, only 10 are American.There are 40 flag officers from different countries involved, only 10of which are American. So it really is a -- I think it's encouragingto see allies stepping up at a level that we haven't seen before. Imean, it has been good.\n\nAMANPOUR: What is the endgame? I mean, really, what is theendgame? We've seen two weeks of bombing. Gadhafi is where he is.Yes, there have been some high profile defections. The president hassaid Gadhafi has to go.\n\nJONES: And this is the next piece that's the difficult piece.Because...\n\nAMANPOUR: But what is -- how does one accomplish that?\n\nJONES: The strategic question is, what do you do when Gadhafigoes? Because we don't know exactly who the opposition is, yet.\n\nAMANPOUR: But before that, how do you get Gadhafi to go?\n\nJONES: Well, that's the part that is being working on. And Ithink...\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you know?\n\nJONES: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the answer tothat. But I do know that that is the wish and the goal of this entireeffort.\n\nAMANPOUR: You mentioned, who are these rebels? It's a questioneverybody wants to know.\n\nJONES: Opposition.\n\nAMANPOUR: Opposition rebels...\n\nJONES: You can call them whatever you want.\n\nAMANPOUR: Whoever they are, freedom fighters. But the world hasnow taken their side. Who are they? Do you know? JONES: Well, I don't -- I personally do not know. And I knowthat there is tremendous effort going on in many capitals around theworld to make sure that we do understand what that is.\n\nAMANPOUR: When you see these rebels, as Alex Marquardt said andwe've been reporting, unable to capitalize on the no-fly zone, whathas to be done to help them? Should they be armed? Should they betrained?\n\nJONES: Well, I think the first thing that has to be done is tofind out who these -- who they are. And so if you start from theproposition that our reason for committing our forces, as Americans oras part of NATO, was basically to avoid a massacre of innocentcivilians, which probably would have happened, and now we're there,and now we have to do -- now we have to take the rest -- follow therest of the trail to identify these people, then decide, you know,whether that's meritorious or not in terms of training, organizing,equipping.\n\nThe United States has not done that yet.\n\nAMANPOUR: Isn't it troubling that we don't know who they are andwhat their goals and aspirations are?\n\nJONES: Well, it's a pop-up mission that came very quickly. Itmetastasized to the point where 700,000 people were going to bethreatened. And, you know, I wish -- in all of these things, wealways want it to be clear, we want nice end-state rules. But the fogof war doesn't sometimes allow for that.\n\nAnd so now we are putting this together, I think, from what I cansee, we're doing the things that have to be done before we decide --before the coalition decides, the U.N. decides exactly what to donext.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's just quickly turn to Yemen, a major Americanally. If Saleh falls, how bad is that for the fight against al Qaeda-- if the president of Yemen falls?\n\nJONES: Well, I think that's -- I think Yemen is very worrisome.This is a -- Saleh has been very skillful over the years in being ableto consolidate and maintain his power. The trends in Yemen are notgood. And this could be a major problem. And where terror isconcerned, this would be a safe haven that would be a very troublingturn of events for us.\n\nAMANPOUR: So is the U.S. to try to keep Saleh in power or what?\n\nJONES: Well, I don't know -- you know, there are certain thingsthat we can do and that we can't do. When events reach a certainstage, they have a life of their own. And it would be nice to be ableto think that we could do everything and make the world, you know,perfect the way we want it. But that's not the case.\n\nSo the trendlines in Yemen are not good. We've invested a lot ofwork in Yemen. But it is a disturbing trend for the future. And thisis -- again, one of the things that I feel strongly about is that whenyou look at what's going on in this part of the world and you look atthe potential, there is reason to be optimistic in some areas andthere is reason to be very concerned in others.\n\nBut it's a tremendous tectonic shift in terms of the world as weknow it, and this part of the world since -- for the last 80 years.\n\nAMANPOUR: General Jones, thank you very much, indeed, forjoining us.\n\nAnd what do you think the U.S. should do next in Libya? Tweetme, @camanpour #libyanext.\n\nMeantime, the costs of the new war are already piling up. Morethan half a billion dollars so far. All this as Congress and theWhite House remain at loggerheads over a federal budget, and agovernment shutdown is looming.\n\nThe deadline just five days off. Will lawmakers beat the clock?We'll hear from one of the Democrats' toughest negotiators, SenatorChuck Schumer, and the top Republican on the Budget Committee, JeffSessions. That's in a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) OHIO: I have never believed that shuttingthe government down was the goal. And frankly, let's all be honest,if you shut the government down, it will end up costing more than yousave because you interrupt contracts -- there are a lot of problemswith the idea of shutting the government down. It is not the goal.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: House Speaker John Boehner, the man in the middle thisweekend, caught between a rowdy freshman class of hardlineconservatives and the more moderate congressional Republicans who wantto deal.\n\nBoehner, of course, wants a deal, too. But as senior politicalcorrespondent Jon Karl tells us, it's hard to broker compromise in atown where compromise itself has become a dirty word.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCROWD: We want it back. We want it back.\n\nJON KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Compromise on spending cuts?Not if these folks have anything to say about it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE; It's time to pick a fight.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because if we don't, we deserve to be thrownout of office.\n\nREP MIKE PENCE, (R) INDIANA: Liberals in the Senate would ratherplay political games and shut down the government instead of making asmall down payment on fiscal discipline and reform. I say, shut itdown.\n\n(CHEERS)\n\nKARL: That was at a Tea Party rally on Capitol Hill where oneorganizer had this message for GOP leaders.\n\nKATHY DIRR, TEA PARTY PATRIOT: I say to the Republicanleadership, take off your lace panties. Stop being noodle-backs. KARL: The attitude runs deep among House Republicans, some ofwhom don't want to compromise on spending cuts, or issues like fundingfor Planned Parenthood. Democrats have already agreed to make morethan $30 billion in cuts over the next six months, perhaps the largestcut Congress has ever made.\n\nBut Speaker of the House John Boehner's biggest challenge may beto convince his rank and file to accept victory.\n\nBOEHNER: We control one half of one third of the government herein Washington. We can't impose our will on another body. We can'timpose our will on the Senate. All we can do is fight for all of thespending cuts we can get an agreement to.\n\nKARL: Democrats have their hot heads, too. One Obamaadministration official said the Republican bill, which cuts $5billion from the agency for International Development would kill kids.That's right. Kill kids.\n\nRAJIV SHAH, USAID ADMINISTRATOR: We estimate, and I believethese are conservative. That HR 1 would lead to 70,000 kids dying.\n\nKARL: For weeks, Democrats have been accusing Republicans ofputting the country at risk of a government shutdown. Enter HowardDean.\n\nHOWARD DEAN, FRM. DNC CHAIRMAN: Yeah!\n\nKARL: Former Democratic Party chairman who told a forum thisweek that it is Democrats who should quietly rooting for a shutdown sothey can blame it all on Republicans.\n\nDEAN: From a partisan point of view, I think it would be thebest thing in the world to have a shutdown.\n\nKARL: And even the Democratic leaders trying to negotiate thedeal seem to have one word describe their Republican colleagues.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Extreme level far to the right.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE; Extreme Tea Party.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Extreme territory beyond what was reasonable.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Small, extreme minority.\n\nKARL: Compromise with extremists out to kill kids? They haveless than a week to make it happen.\n\nFor This Week I'm Jonathan Karl.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And joining me now, the Senate's third rankingDemocrat, who you just saw there, Chuck Schumer, who joins us from hishome state of New York, at our bureau there this morning. And with mehere in the Newseum, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the rankingRepublican on the budget committee.\n\nSenators thank you very much for joining me.\n\nWell, you saw Jon Karl's piece. And there's, you know, a lot ofhijinks in that piece.\n\nLet's get to the bottom of what's going on, Senator Sessions, hasany progress been made this weekend amongst negotiators?\n\nSESSIONS: I don't know that it has.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that a no?\n\nSESSIONS: Well, I don't know that it has.\n\nMr. Boehner, the speaker, has indicated that he has not reachedan agreement. So has Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. So Ithink that negotiations continue and they need to continue.\n\nBut what this is -- Christiane, we really need to understand thisis more than a Republican-Democratic squabble. This is -- thefundamental question is, are we headed to a financial crisis if wedon't get off the fiscal course we're on? We have had witness afterwitness say that is so, Erskine Bowles said that President Obama'schoice to head the debt commission, we're facing the most predictabledebt crisis in American history. It could happen within two years.\n\nWe have got to take action now.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we'll get to that.\n\nSenator Schumer, from your perspective, has any progress beenmade? Will there be a shutdown in five days?\n\nSCHUMER: Yes. No I don't -- excuse me. I don't think therewill be a shutdown, Christiane. In fact, I'm quite optimistic. Ithink progress is being made. They're working off a number, $33billion in cuts. That's very reasonable. It's right in between whatDemocrats have proposed and Republicans have proposed right in themiddle. And after all, that was the number proposed originally by theHouse Republican leaders, Ryan and Rogers, the head of theappropriations committee.\n\nSo they're working off that number. That's good. Now we have tofigure out what goes into that number. And that's where thediscussions are headed.\n\nLet me just say a word about that. We have two goals here. Jeffis right, we have to deal with the deficit very seriously. But wealso have to deal with the economy and job growth. And we don't wantto snuff that out. And particularly when we're beginning to see jobsgrow.\n\nIf you just cut from domestic discretionary, you'll have to cutthings like helping students go to college, you'll have to cutscientific research, including cancer research. These things havecreated millions of jobs through the years.\n\nAnd so the good news is this: There's another place we can lookto cut not just on domestic discretionary. It's called mandatoryspending. It requires you to do something for somebody, but the wayof doing it is not required. We can find cuts in places likeagriculture and justice and banking. These are now being calledCHIMPS...\n\nAMANPOUR: CHIMPS?\n\nSCHUMER: CHIMPS, yes, changes in mandatory program spending.\n\nAnd we've offered about $10 billion of those to our Republicancolleagues. They're not adverse to them, because HR 1 had some ofthose in. And I believe that's how we can come to an agreement thatboth keeps job growth and cuts the deficit at about the $33 billionlevel. And I believe that's where we'll end up.\n\nAMANPOUR: You've raised a number of issues there. Let me firstquickly ask Senator Sessions, do you -- we're talking about the jobnumbers, do you think that's -- that's good news, obviously. The jobnumbers have increased. The unemployment number has come down, lowestin two years.\n\nSESSIONS: Well, it's really high.\n\nAMANPOUR: It is, but it's come down. That's good.\n\nSESSIONS: Not much.\n\nThis was a good month. This was a good month of a little over200,000. We need to average 250,000 jobs a month. In the last threemonths we have only averaged 124,000 new jobs. We are well belowwhere we need to be.\n\nOne of the reasons, as the testimony of Secretary Geithner,President Obama's Secretary of Treasury, testified that the debt ispulling down our growth and creates a threat of a crisis that couldput us back into recession. We have got to make changes now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can you live with the short-term method here. Can youlive with the $33 billion in cuts?\n\nSESSIONS: I really believe we should do 61 total as the Houseproposed over ten years. That would be a savings of $860 billion.\n\nWe have to borrow this money. The House has sent a bill overthat reduces what is before us, discretionary spending, CR, is theonly thing before us. They proposed 61. The Democrats started at 4or 5. They've how to been pushed up to halfway. I think we should goall the way.\n\nBut we'll have to let our leaders work on this and see,hopefully, an agreement that goes as far as possible.\n\nAMANPOUR: As this haggling continues, I'm going to ask you,Senator Sessions. Speaker Boehner this week basically said, and Ithink it's sarcasm, thank you guys for painting me into a box that'sjust where I want to be, talking about the conservative -- the TeaPartiers. Have they held the Republican leadership sort of hostage inthese negotiations.\n\nSESSIONS: Christiane, that's the Democratic spin. That's theway...\n\nAMANPOUR: But this is what Speaker Boehner said.\n\nSESSIONS: I know that. But I'm telling you what the real dealis. This week, the House -- Republican House will submit a mature,serious budget for long-term reform of spending in America that willavoid a debt crisis this country is facing in two years, according toMr. Erskine Bowles.\n\nThe Democrats have no plan except the president's plan whichmakes the debt worse than the current trajectory we're on. It raisestaxes. It increases spending even more. It doubles the debt. We'lltake interest from $200 billion last year in one year to $900 billionin 10 years, crowding out all kind of social programs and beneficialprograms that Senator Schumer has talked about.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. Senator Schumer...\n\nSCHUMER: Well, let me say this, Christiane. Yes, I have a lotof sympathy for Speaker Boehner because he does want to come to anagreement. He knows how devastating a shutdown would be. That's hiswords, not ours. Although we all agree on that.\n\nThe one group that's standing in the way here is the tea party.Now they have said that a shutdown is a good thing. You saw it onthat tape. Some of their leaders have said it over and over again.Sarah Palin, Mike Pence, Michelle Bachmann. They say it's our way orno way.\n\nWell, that's not how the American government works. And I wouldsay this though, here's the good news. The American people are seeingthe tea party for what it is, extreme. And their popularity isdeclining.\n\nThey now have only 33 percent of people in support of them, and47 percent people against them. And when they lose clout, it makes anagreement much more likely. It's another reason I'm optimistic.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Let me just ask you this before we turn toyou, Senator Sessions. Today -- or rather, this week, you sort ofstepped in it, sort of recording-wise. You were caught briefing yourfellow senators on how to address this issue, didn't know apparentlythe reporters were still on the conference call. Let's just playthat, because it plays right into the spin and the language about whatis going on right now.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nSCHUMER: I always use the word \"extreme.\" That's what the caucusinstructed me to do the other week. Extreme cuts and all theseriders. And Boehner is in a box. But if he supports the tea party,there's going to inevitably be a shutdown.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nSCHUMER: Now, you know, Christiane, I have no problem withreporters hearing that. I said it a few hours before on the floor ofthe Senate. I've said on it this show. The tea party is the groupstanding in the way. They are extreme.\n\nAny group that says you don't cut oil subsidies to companiesmaking billions and billions of dollars, subsidies that were passedwhen the price of oil was $17 to encourage production, and now theprice is over $100, and at the same time, says, cut student aid tohelp qualified students go to college, yes, I believe they're extreme.And I have no problem with that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: OK, Senator Sessions, extreme and holding the partyhostage.\n\nSESSIONS: It's absolutely false. Millions of Americansparticipated in the tea parties. Tens of millions of Americanssupport and believe what they're saying. And they are rightfundamentally. Maybe they don't understand all the realities ofWashington politics.\n\nAMANPOUR: But are they right for being...\n\nSESSIONS: But fundamentally they know this country is on a pathto fiscal disaster. As Erskine Bowles said, as Secretary Geithner hassaid, as Alan Greenspan has said, we're heading -- and this Democraticleadership proposes nothing.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you believe...\n\nSESSIONS: But to attack the people who are trying to get thiscountry on the right course.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you believe there will be a shutdown?\n\nSESSIONS: I hope not.\n\nAMANPOUR: But do you think there will be?\n\nSESSIONS: I doubt it. I doubt there will be a shutdown.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Well, both of you agree on that. And, ofcourse, we do have to talk at another time about these huge mega-issues, which really right now is tinkering around the edges, isn'tit? The big, big entitlement programs.\n\nSESSIONS: We're talking about trillions of dollars.\n\nAMANPOUR: Precisely. And we'll have you back... SESSIONS: And the president has no plan whatsoever to deal withit.\n\nAMANPOUR: There seems to be no plan in general.\n\nSCHUMER: That's not true at all.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we'll discuss that the next time.\n\nSCHUMER: That's not true at all.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you very much, indeed, for being on thisprogram.\n\nAnd tell us your thoughts on the war on Capitol Hill. Tweet me@camanpour #budgetbattle.\n\nAnd up next, new job numbers are moving in the right direction,as we have heard, but could a government shutdown deal a serious blowto the recovery? We'll get answers from our roundtable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: A Florida pastor's reckless stunt sends shock wavesacross Afghanistan, bringing mayhem and death. But today, Terry Jonesis unrepentant. How does the White House contain the damage caused bya preacher gone rogue? Our \"Roundtable\" tackles that one. Staytuned.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Today, we learned that we added 230,000 private sectorjobs last month. And that's good news. That means more packages,right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: The president at a UPS facility on Friday. And yes,the jobs picture is looking up. Unemployment is the lowest it hasbeen since March of 2009, just after President Obama took office. Soit's good news, if 8.8 percent unemployment can be considered goodnews. But as the recovery picks up steam, the budget showdown inWashington threatens to derail the progress that has been made.\n\nHere to make sense of it all, our \"Roundtable\" with George Will;Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning New York Times columnist; TorieClarke, the former Pentagon spokeswoman in the Bush administration;and David Ignatius of The Washington Post.\n\nGreat to see you all here. So, the jobs numbers, good, right?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPAUL KRUGMAN, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, it begins with a sigh,because, look, this is better than naught. Right? Better than nojobs. But unemployment is a funny number. Unemployment, you're onlyconsidered unemployed if you're actively looking for work. And so ifyou look, over the past year, the unemployment rates have come down alot, significantly anyway. But that's basically almost all becausefewer people are looking for work.\n\nAMANPOUR: So where is it headed in terms of the people lookingfor work?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, it's still terrible. It's still a terrible jobmarket. It's not deteriorating. But it's still a very -- there'sstill about five times as many people looking for jobs as there arejob openings. And it's still -- the length, the average duration ofunemployment hit a new record.\n\nSo we're in a situation where, you know, things are not gettingworse, or at least not getting worse in all dimensions anymore.\n\nAMANPOUR: So is that good news? It's not getting worse.\n\nGEORGE WILL, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, it's not getting worse.Actually, the good news within the news is that there are 14,000 fewerpeople working for government in the United States as state and localgovernments shed jobs.\n\nBut a corollary of what Paul just said is that when the economypicks up and people become encouraged to go back into seeking jobs,you could have the economy rising and unemployment risingsimultaneously.\n\nWe lost more jobs in this great recession than the last fourrecessions combined. Now we have had, for 28 months, essentially zerointerest rates. The quantitative easing, the printing of money thatbegan in November, under this the Fed -- the Federal Reserve Board hasbeen buying 70 percent of the new issues of Treasury debt. That endsin June.\n\nThat probably distresses Paul.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, I would just say that the aftermath of a terriblefinancial crisis, and this was the worst financial crisis since the1930s, is always a prolonged period of weak growth. And the tragedyis that Washington has given up on the jobs picture.\n\nIt's not that -- it's not a failure of policy. I think thepolicies that we have undertaken made things less bad than they wouldhave been. But here we are with still terrible unemployment rate, 37weeks the average unemployed person is unemployed. And no interest inWashington about doing anything to create jobs.\n\nAMANPOUR: So we were just speaking to Senators Sessions andSchumer. Did you hear anything from them that would lead to aslightly less grim outlook?\n\nIGNATIUS: Only that you heard a reluctance on both sides to takethe budget showdown off the edge of a cliff. I didn't hear muchenthusiasm for a shutdown from Senator Sessions on the Republicanside.\n\nI think what's excited the White House about these numbers is notthe unemployment number per se, because as Paul says, there are allsorts of complicated factors that go into that, but the job growthnumber. And it does look as if the economy is finally beginning togenerate jobs in the numbers that over time, would bring theunemployment rate down and would get you back on a trajectory of morenormal growth. We're not there yet. But I think people see, youknow, a light at the end of the tunnel, you can say, they at least seethe tunnel.\n\nCLARKE: I think the good thing from the two senators is neitherone of them tried to score huge political points one way or the other,which is kind of the norm, and I thought was very responsible andeven-handed, which is good.\n\nBut here's the failure of policy, I think. What will really getthe private sector humming and hiring a lot of people is if they havepredictability and certainty about things like regulatory regimes andare some of these trade agreements going to go through that we reallyneed? Because it is a global picture, not just a domestic one.\n\nAnd I know there's a lot going on, but nobody seems to befocusing on that, not the administration, not Congress. And Paul islaughing.\n\nKRUGMAN: Because that's not -- the reason businesses are notinvesting is they have tons and tons of excess capacity. There's avery clear relationship historically between the amount ofunemployment and the amount of business investment. When unemploymentis high, when capacity is low, investment is low. There's nothing --all of this stuff about uncertainty is just a myth being made up toblame this on Obama.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLARKE: No, it's not. Money is a coward. Money is a coward.It's not going to go unless it knows it can make money.\n\nKRUGMAN: There's nothing in there. There's nothing in there.It's exactly what you expect.\n\nAMANPOUR: Torie mentioned reform. And tax reform is one ofthem. I mean, it looks like this week, there was this whole issuewith Jeffrey Immelt, the president's adviser, and you know, allegedlypaying actually no tax on having made billions of dollars in profit,the company. It was OK. He took advantage of the system. But is itright? Does that need to be conformed (ph)? GE?\n\nWILL: It's an old axiom that what is alarming in Washington isnot what's done that is illegal but what is done that's legal. No oneis accusing GE of doing anything other than taking advantage of thebaroque tax code that we have produced over time. Mitch Daniels, thegovernor of Indiana, says, wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a taxcode that looks as though someone designed it on purpose? Theydesigned a tax code that has produced the following interestingnumber. According to Investors Business Daily, 975 people work in thetax department of GE, just trying to mine the tax code for advantage.\n\nAMANPOUR: That's true (ph), but it doesn't look good, though,does it? The optics of this?\n\nKRUGMAN: No, I have to say that Obama has got a pretty badrecord now. He picked Alan Simpson to co-head the debt commission,which turned out to be given to making some rather strange remarks.As his adviser on the economy, he managed to pick the head of acorporation that is managing not to pay any taxes.\n\nAnd look, we do need tax reform. But the biggest obstacle to taxreform right now is that any reasonable tax reform is going to raisetaxes on some people. Because you're going to close some loopholes.And what we have is the right wing of the Republican Party, the GroverNorquist types saying, no taxes on anybody should ever go up. And wecan't have a tax reform that consists solely of cutting taxes. Wehave to have one that levels the taxes. So at the moment, tax reformis just not on the agenda, realistically, because we have no agreementon that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think President Obama is as involved in, forinstance, the budget battles that are going on in Congress as youwould like to see him?\n\nIGNATIUS: In classic Obama fashion, he's involved but tries toconceal his hand. He's the most reticent chief executive I canremember. For example yesterday, Saturday, he was on the phone bothto John Boehner, the House speaker, and to Harry Reid, the Senatemajority leader, trying to talk about the details of the compromisethey hope will be coming this week.\n\nOn the question that Paul is raising, whether we're ever going toget to the point where we're seriously talking about taxsimplification, tax changes that would lead to better budget balanceand reductions in the deficits that worry everybody, I think thisWhite House is getting ready for a process. And I think it couldactually come quite soon. By June, July, in which the White House,which has been reticent, silent on all of this, will begin to roll outsome ideas similar to those that were in the Simpson-Bowles deficitcommission. And I think we could have this summer a big and a veryimportant debate on how to get these numbers better.\n\nAMANPOUR: One thing we didn't get to talk about with thesenators was the really big cuts or the big reforms that have to bemade in entitlements. And also on the Pentagon. Where do you thinkcan big cuts be made in the Pentagon budget?\n\nCLARKE: Oh, man. It's like the morbidly obese patient that'salmost, where do you start? It really is. And God bless anyone,Rumsfeld, Gates and others who are trying. It's very, very hard.They have made some significant cuts. And there is plenty, plenty ofwaste in that place. Any time you have 2 or 3 million employees,depends on how you count them, there's a lot of waste.\n\nBut that wouldn't be the first place I would start. Most peoplewould argue that's not the one that is going to make a big difference.And whether or not these folks up the street are really serious is ifthey tackle the major, major entitlement programs.\n\nRepublicans say they are going to. It has yet to be seen.\n\nAMANPOUR: Hold that thought and we'll continue. With theworld's eyes on Libya, Afghanistan explodes anew with rage and murderin the streets there. How can the United States extinguish a fusethat's been lit by that renegade Florida pastor who took it uponhimself to burn a Koran? We'll have that with our roundtable when wecome back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should you bear any responsibility forinciting today's horrific actions?\n\nTERRY JONES: We do not feel responsible, no. We feel more thatthe Muslims and the radical element of Islam, they used that as anexcuse.\n\nSTAFFAN DE MISTURA, CHIEF OF UN ASSISTANCE MISSION INAFGHANISTAN: I would tell him my three colleagues have died, andseven all together have died. We are very good people and we'reworking hard. So you should be feeling guilty and should not do that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: That was Staffan de Mistura, chief of the U.N.assistance mission in Afghanistan right there talking and weighing inon pastor Terry Jones, who decided to burn a Koran. That act, aswe've been telling you, has set off a tidal wave of anger and violencein Afghanistan. Pastor Jones of the ironically named Dove WorldOutreach Center is unrepentant and unbowed. And still a huge headachefor the Obama administration.\n\nSo let's bring that subject back to our roundtable. Let me askyou, David Ignatius, is this a one-time horrible thing or is thissomething that's going to have a lingering effect in Afghanistan rightnow? And to the detriment of the Americans?\n\nIGNATIUS: Sadly, this incident of people protesting and killingpeople because of anger at the burning of Korans, but it's reallyanger at what they see as a United States that doesn't respect theirreligion, it recurs in Afghanistan and Pakistan so often. I thinkthey are irresponsible actions by pastor Jones and by the Muslimsheikhs who on Friday prayers incited people, but the larger point isthat deep into a war where we -- our strategy is counterinsurgency, toget the population with us and working with us to fight against theTaliban, you see what angry, anti-American feeling is out there. Evenin areas that are remote from the fighting like Mazar-e Sharif in thenorth -- that is where the 12 U.N. people were killed. That's farfrom the battlefield. So that's what worries me.\n\nAMANPOUR: Torie, what should the administration be doing to winback some of these hearts and minds?\n\nCLARKE: It is going to be very, very hard. Right or wrong, theytake it as a sign, an excuse, and a reason to go after the UnitedStates.\n\nAMANPOUR: General Petraeus came out strongly today,categorically blaming the pastor and basically saying this is notrepresentative of the U.S.\n\nCLARKE: And I know extraordinary people at extraordinary levelshave talked to him before saying it is needlessly provocative. Yes,in this country you can talk about freedom of speech, but you cannotdo this and underestimate the consequences it can have around theworld.\n\nThere was no need to do this. But I think it will take a longtime to repair these sorts of things. Fairly or unfairly, it willtake a long time to repair them.\n\nAMANPOUR: And here we are, two weeks into Libya now, which somepeople are calling a war others aren't. Are you calling it a war?\n\nWILL: Of course it's a war. War planes flown by warriors doingwhat war looks like, which is dropping bombs.\n\nAMANPOUR: Did the president convince you in his speech on Mondaythat this was in the vital national interests? It had a limited goal,limited duration?\n\nWILL: What he said in his speech was broadening our militarymission to include regime change would be a mistake. If so, we'remaking it.\n\nIt's perfectly clear that we who worried about mission creep gotit wrong. It was mission gallop. Weeks ago when the president saidthis would be matter of days not weeks. He said, also, we were toldthere would be no boots on the ground. Well there may not be boots,there are certainly shoes on the ground now.\n\nAMANPOUR: The CIA?\n\nWILL: They're occupied by CIA people, because like it or not,the logic of events says that this is a failure if Gadhafi survives.Some of us worry that, even worse than the failure would be thesuccess, because it is going to whet the appetite of humanitarianimperialists for more of these interventions. AMANPOUR: Well, General Jones was telling me that it was a risk,one way or the other, whether Gadhafi stays or goes, mostly because wedon't know the rebels.\n\nA lot has been made of the end game. George just rightlymentioned that the president said regime change was not the goal, butthe president also says that Gadhafi has to go. So where are we here?\n\nKRUGMAN: This is clear. I actually have a lot of sympathy forthe president on this. It's clearly -- this was not like Iraq. Thiswas not a gung-ho president who wanted to win himself some militaryglory. There is going to be no landings on aircraft carriers for thisone, right? This was something where he was dragged in. He wasdragged in by the spectacle of a looming humanitarian disaster.\n\nAnd it's very, very hard -- it's hard both directions. I thinkif you actually look at the people like me who are very opposed toIraq, we're actually very divided. And in many cases divided withinourselves, as I am. But this is -- this was not easy. Of coursethere's no clear end game. This was something where pulled in byevents.\n\nI think the president's speech wasn't very effective because I'mpretty sure he's internally divided too. But I think that's to hiscredit.\n\nCLARKE: Wow. Maxwell Taylor, who President Kennedy brought backto look at Vietnam did this amazing speech in which he said, when youlook at these things, the commitment of forces, you better be able toexplain to the man in the street in a simple sentence or two whatyou're trying to accomplish.\n\nI could pick 500 people off the street and say what are we tryingto get done in Libya? They would not be able to answer that question.I don't know what the answer to that question is.\n\nAMANPOUR: One of your former colleagues in the Bushadministration, Megan Sullivan, has just written an op-ed...\n\nCLARKE: Smart piece.\n\nAMANPOUR: ...saying that it could be Obama's Iraq. I mean, isthat completely fantastical or is that possible?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLARKE: I think, with all due respect for all these brilliantpeople sitting around the table, I think anybody that says they knowis either stupid or lying. We don't know.\n\nAMANPOUR: David?\n\nCLARKE: You're either going to be stupid or lying. So go ahead.\n\nIGNATIUS: The unknowns are scary. Secretary of Defense Gatessaid to me and then on your show, I think, the shows -- this is darkterritory. We don't see what is down there. I think there's reasonnot to worry this is spinning off to an Iraq. There are not the tensof thousands of troops on the ground.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think Gadhafi will go?\n\nIGNATIUS: I think the White House strategy today is to seek whatone person described to me as regime implosion. And that ishappening. This regime that requires cash to survive. The cashbasically is cut off. This is a regime that has a small inner circleof people close to Gadhafi. One by one, they're leaving.They're going to London. They're defecting to Egypt.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, really two biggies.\n\nIGNATIUS: Well, there are more on the way. I have been toldanother senior cabinet minister has already made his deal and will beout soon.\n\nThe point is we're picking off elements around Gadhafi. The hopeis that he'll end up as the mayor of Tripoli. Is that a realistichope? Hard to say, but it's not -- I wouldn't rule that out asimpossible.\n\nAMANPOUR: Or a safe area around Benghazi for maybe 12 years likewe had with Saddam Hussein in Kuwait -- in Iraq rather.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, the parallel with the Kurdish protection afterthe first Gulf war is a better parallel. And that was not ideal, butit was not such a terrible thing either.\n\nAMANPOUR: We have to go. Everybody, thank you very much. Andthis conversation continues in the Green Room. You can watch atabcnews.com\/thisweek.\n\nAnd up next, we'll give you a tax season warning as we look atthe week ahead on ABC News.

Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better.\u201d\n\nMr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement \u0097 \u201cislands of excellence,\u201d he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs.\n\nThe stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union.\n\nImage Upon meeting department employees last month, Arne Duncan, the new education secretary, asked them to call him by his first name. \u0093My name is Arne,\u0094 he said. \u0093It\u0092s not Mr. Secretary.\u0094 Credit... Veronika Lukasova for The New York Times\n\nThe positions of deputy secretary, under secretary and chief of staff and dozens of other senior posts at the Education Department remain unfilled, so Mr. Duncan is relying on help from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to develop procedures for distributing the stimulus billions quickly, and many aides, he said, have been working evenings and weekends to begin organizing the effort.",

    "text":"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.\n\nIf I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\nSoldiers and police are supposed to be different. \u2026 Police look inward. They\u2019re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It\u2019s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\nWhy armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (\u201c\u2018This my property!\u2019 he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.\u201d) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that \u201cWe rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone\u201d?\n\nOlson added, \u201cthe dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\u201d\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies\u2014where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\u201d\n\nBernick continued, \u201cfederal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\u201d\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \u201ctoday, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country\u2014tanks included.\u201d\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown\u2019s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

    "text":"EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nProtecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\nSection 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\n\nNumerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\n\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \"honor\" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\nSec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).\n\n(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.\n\n(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.\n\n(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.\n\n(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.\n\nSec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n\nSec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n\n(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.\n\n(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\n(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.\n\n(f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n\n(g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\n\nSec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.\n\nSec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\n\nSec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.\n\n(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.\n\nSec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.\n\nSec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:\n\n(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;\n\n(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n\n(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n\n(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\n\n(b) The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.\n\nSec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nDONALD J.

    "text":"Rick Santorum: By amending constitution, we can balance the budget for good\n\nBy RICK SANTORUM\n\nLast summer, we saw a great groundswell of national support to get our fiscal house in order by cutting and capping federal spending and passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. However, the President refused to lead and instead pushed the tough decisions to a bureaucratic Washington committee to solve the problem, and though it was named the 'Supercommittee' it couldn't even agree on cutting Post-It Notes from the office supply closet. Now, because of the inaction, we are faced with drastic defense cuts at a time when reports show a nuclear Iran has emerged as a clear and present danger.I supported the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' movement, but the reality is that what we really need is 'Balance, Balance, Grow' - because without a balanced budget amendment, and a path to economic prosperity, we cannot ever trust the government to actively try and balance the federal budget.Both parties can talk all they want about fiscal responsibility, but passing a balanced budget amendment that requires a supermajority for any tax increase and puts a cap on federal spending at 18 percent of GDP is the only way to permanently ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.Currently, government spending has exploded to nearly 25 percent of GDP and is well on its way to 40 percent. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.Yes, we should cut spending now, but our ultimate goal is to shrink the size and scope of the federal government forever, and passing a balanced budget amendment will permanently cap spending and ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.This cornerstone of my economic policy ultimately empowers the American family and builds economic freedom.A balanced budget amendment is a long-term, permanent fix to over-spending, and it would not be a 'draconian' method because it would not happen overnight. The process to pass and ratify a constitutional amendment will take six to eight years. That not only gives our government time to put our budget on a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, but it sets a deadline for our representatives to get the job done.The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work. The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding 'no' vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals.Passing a balanced budget amendment will also force our government to address the entitlement crisis crippling our economy. For years, every member of Congress has been afraid of touching entitlements because it is considered the 'third rail of politics.' But with the passage of the balanced budget amendment, we'll be forced to address this crucial piece of the fiscal puzzle. I know that we can make the tough choices necessary to restructure and save those programs because we've done it before. In 1996, I led the fight to reform the welfare system, ending dependency for millions and providing them with avenues to get back to work. I led that fight and got conservative results despite opposition from a popular President, Bill Clinton, who vetoed the bill twice.And finally, we must implement policies to immediately grow our economy, and this starts with revitalizing our manufacturing sector, which can be the great multiplier on our economy. Yes, we must make more things in America again, but first, we must create an environment that breeds more opportunity here at home. We must eliminate the corporate tax for manufacturers, eliminate all Obama-era regulations that cost business more than $100 million a year, and eliminate the excise tax on overseas profits when those revenues are reinvested in American plants and equipment. We must also make sure the government is not in the way of energy production, and instead increase all forms of energy exploration: whether oil, natural gas, coal, etc. We must reduce the cost of energy across the board for everyone who goes to the pump to fill up their automobile and for the manufacturing plant that produces the automobile itself. This will jump-start our economy, broaden our tax base and, most importantly, rebuild the great middle of our society that has been lost along with our manufacturing jobs over the past 40 years.You can trust my commitment to getting this economy going again, and together we can finish the job we came so close to completing: passing a balanced budget amendment, which is the only way to keep our budget under control for good.\n\n\n\nColumn Presidential Guest Commentary",

Western officials have questioned whether Russia is actually targeting moderate rebels in a move to bolster its flagging ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nRelated: Assad Goes to Moscow to Say Thanks to Putin\n\nPutin\u2019s rating had been hovering above 80 percent since spring 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula and endorsed a bloody pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith the latest VTsIOM poll, Putin's popularity is now just a notch below that of Central Asian dictators \u2014 who can often rack up between 90 and 97 percent of votes in elections.\n\nWhile VTsIOM is a respected pollster, analysts have long questioned Russian approval polls. Studies show that in authoritarian states, polls can overstate the popularity of incumbent leaders by between 5 and 20 percent because many respondents give the answers that they think are expected of them.\n\nRelated: Syrians Say Russian Airstrikes Bring 'Massive Destruction'\n\nThe latest figures come amid a prolonged economic slump.

    "text":"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\n\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"\n\nThe report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"\n\nThe National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.\n\nMexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.\n\nDrugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.\n\nSmugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn\u2019t been studying drug facts for nothing.\n\nWe rate this claim True.",

    "text":"While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work \u2014 but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump \u2014 in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered \u2014 but deflation, not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, there\u2019s fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief.\n\nWho are these creditors I\u2019m talking about? Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that it\u2019s all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.\n\nNo, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.\n\nAnd that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, it\u2019s the class that has personal access to policy makers \u2014 many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesn\u2019t have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that what\u2019s good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings \u2014 hey, they\u2019re rich, they\u2019re smart, and they have great tailors \u2014 must be good for the economy as a whole.\n\nBut the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else. And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game.",

It\u2019s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.\n\n\n\nI want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who\u2019s here. (Applause.) We've got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nI see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he\u2019s got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so they\u2019ve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesn\u2019t have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.\n\n\n\nDick Durbin couldn\u2019t make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) He\u2019s doing a great job. And we\u2019ve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we\u2019re going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd all of you are here, and it\u2019s great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nSo, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. Didn\u2019t even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didn\u2019t work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.\n\n\n\nAnd on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented what\u2019s best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nSee, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries weren\u2019t keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.\n\n\n\nIn the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.\n\n\n\nBut over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.\n\n\n\nAnd so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people\u2019s wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged.\n\n\n\nAnd towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.\n\n\n\nNow, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we\u2019re off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.\n\n\n\nAnd because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of Honda\u2019s cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, they\u2019re building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- they\u2019re bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We\u2019re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- we\u2019ve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.\n\n\n\nAs a country, we\u2019ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.\n\n\n\nBut -- and here's the big \u201cbut\u201d -- I\u2019m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who\u2019ve been out of work for some time.\n\n\n\nToday, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven\u2019t seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they\u2019re going to be able to retire.\n\n\n\nSo in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.\n\n\n\nThis growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it\u2019s bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why reversing these trends has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) It\u2019s certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasn\u2019t just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what we\u2019ve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn\u2019t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.\n\n\n\nThen, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we don\u2019t need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks who\u2019ve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAlmost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.\n\n\n\nThen, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.\n\n\n\nBut you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who won\u2019t even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America\u2019s farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they\u2019ll shift the topic to \u201cout-of-control government spending\u201d \u2013- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nOr they\u2019ll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they\u2019ve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people who\u2019ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they\u2019ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) That\u2019s what this is about. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we've been fighting for.\n\n\n\nBut with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.\n\n\n\nThis moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That\u2019s what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That\u2019s why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need to be talking about. That\u2019s what Washington needs to be focused on.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. That\u2019s what we need. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need right now. That\u2019s what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, some of these ideas I\u2019ve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, of course, we\u2019ll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. We\u2019ve got to standing up for civil rights. We\u2019ve got to stand up for women\u2019s rights. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo all those issues are important, and we\u2019ll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don\u2019t have a growing, thriving middle class then we won\u2019t have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won\u2019t have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.\n\n\n\nNow, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what\u2019s at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I\u2019ll use it. (Applause.) Where I can\u2019t act on my own and Congress isn\u2019t cooperating, I\u2019ll pick up the phone -- I\u2019ll call CEOs; I\u2019ll call philanthropists; I\u2019ll call college presidents; I\u2019ll call labor leaders. I\u2019ll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children\u2019s future, our grandchildren\u2019s future, for all Americans.\n\nSo let me give you a quick preview of what I\u2019ll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.\n\n\n\nNow, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So I\u2019m going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe want to make sure that -- we\u2019re going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- I\u2019m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let\u2019s tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know there\u2019s an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let\u2019s put some folks to work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But we\u2019ve got work to do all across the country. We\u2019ve got ports that aren\u2019t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two years\u2019 time. If we don\u2019t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We\u2019ve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nBusinesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can\u2019t be outsourced. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, this isn\u2019t a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that\u2019s inefficient at a time when it\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s been since the 1950s to build things. It\u2019s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.\n\n\n\nThe longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They\u2019ll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we\u2019ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIn an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they\u2019ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they\u2019ll reward those folks with good pay.\n\n\n\nThe days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn\u2019t need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they\u2019re not going away. Those old days aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\n\nSo we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. That\u2019s what we have to do. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they\u2019re going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t make this investment, we\u2019re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don\u2019t require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of America\u2019s students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. We\u2019re making that happen right now. (Applause.) We\u2019ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didn\u2019t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to challenge CEOs from some of America\u2019s best companies to hire more Americans who\u2019ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 an honest look.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That, too.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that\u2019s straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and that\u2019s the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn\u2019t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That\u2019s in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, we\u2019re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo this is all a good start -- but it isn\u2019t enough. Families and taxpayers can\u2019t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We\u2019ll never have enough loan money, we\u2019ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. We\u2019ve got to get more out of what we pay for.\n\n\n\nNow, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, they\u2019re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.\n\n\n\nSo this afternoon, I\u2019ll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who\u2019s willing to work for it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, so you\u2019ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, that\u2019s your biggest asset. For most families, that\u2019s where your life\u2019s work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, we\u2019ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn\u2019t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.\n\n\n\nSo already, I\u2019ve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney\u2019s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We\u2019ll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system that\u2019s rock-solid for future generations.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It\u2019s getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.\n\n\n\nNow, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they don\u2019t have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nGood job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.\n\n\n\nFifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you\u2019ve worked a lifetime to build.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if you\u2019re one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don\u2019t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- that\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you\u2019d buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.\n\n\n\nAnd if you're one of the up to half of all Americans who\u2019ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act does. That\u2019s what it does. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I don\u2019t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don\u2019t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that\u2019s a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.\n\n\n\nSo just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're paying today -- 50 percent lower. (Applause.) So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who\u2019ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents' plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, you'll have the security of knowing that everything you\u2019ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nFinally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- I\u2019m going to make the case for why we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who haven't quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we\u2019ve never guaranteed success -- that's not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. (Applause.) We've tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. That's all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you're willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too. That's the American idea. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years. And that\u2019s a betrayal of the American idea. And that\u2019s why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class.\n\n\n\nThe best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community. So we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. (Applause.) We need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe're not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life\u2019s biggest winners or losers. And after years in which we\u2019ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break. A plant leaves. Somebody gets sick. Somebody loses a home. We've seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors. We've seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.\n\n\n\nSo good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- that's where I will focus my energies. (Applause.) That's where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.\n\n\n\nThese are the plans that I'll lay out across this country. But I won\u2019t be able to do it alone, so I'm going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We\u2019ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I\u2019ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I\u2019m going to highlight the ones that do just that.\n\n\n\nThere are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. (Applause.) Companies like -- there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it\u2019s not just good for the employees, it\u2019s good for their businesses to treat workers well. It\u2019s good for America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats we\u2019ve got to question some of our old assumptions. We\u2019ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to be willing to -- we\u2019ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We can't just -- Democrats can't just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing. If we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and I believe that -- we\u2019ve an obligation to prove it. And that means that we\u2019ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of you\u2019ve said before; some of them sound great, but you can't get those through Congress. Republicans won\u2019t agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I\u2019ll be proposing. I know because they\u2019ve said so. But they worry they\u2019ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.\n\n\n\nNow, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they\u2019re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.\n\n\n\nIn either case, I say to these members of Congress: I\u2019m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it\u2019s time for you to lay out your ideas. (Applause.) You can't just be against something. You got to be for something. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEven if you think I\u2019ve done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it\u2019s not enough for you just to oppose me. You got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you\u2019re willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country\u2019s infrastructure, let\u2019s go. If you\u2019ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let\u2019s hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nRepealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you\u2019re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I\u2019m ready to work. (Applause.) But you should know that I will not accept deals that don\u2019t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since I first took office. (Applause.) As a country, we\u2019re older and wiser. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wiser, but I\u2019m certainly older. (Laughter.) And as long as Congress doesn\u2019t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don\u2019t shut down the government just because I\u2019m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don\u2019t risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we\u2019ve already racked up, something that we\u2019ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don\u2019t do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, that\u2019s our choice. If we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money\u2019s power will distort our politics even more.\n\n\n\nSocial tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn\u2019t improving. And the fundamental optimism that\u2019s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the vision I have for this country. It\u2019s not the vision you have for this country. That\u2019s not the America we know. That\u2019s not the vision we should be settling for. That\u2019s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.\n\n\n\nI have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that\u2019s how to use every minute -- (applause) -- the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term -- (laughter) -- to make this country work for working Americans again. (Applause.) That\u2019s all I care about. I don\u2019t have another election. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019ll tell you, Galesburg, that\u2019s where I believe America needs to go. I believe that\u2019s where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we\u2019re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we\u2019ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger five years from now. It will be stronger 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd in the end, isn't that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. (Applause.) We haven\u2019t just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWhen we think about our own communities -- we're not a mean people; we're not a selfish people; we're not a people that just looks out for \u201cnumber one.\u201d Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That\u2019s why we don\u2019t call it John\u2019s dream or Susie\u2019s dream or Barack\u2019s dream or Pat's dream -- we call it the American Dream. And that\u2019s what makes this country special -- the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we're fighting for.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, Congress is tough right now, but that\u2019s not going to stop me. We're going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. We're going to go on the road and talk to you, and you'll have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we're going to focus on this thing that matters.\n\n\n\nOne of America\u2019s greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago -- (applause) -- he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie, and then the prairie sent out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful -- how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote, \u201cI speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, America, we\u2019ve made it through the worst of yesterday\u2019s winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. We've got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love.\n\n\n\nSo thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEND\n\n1:17 P.M. CDT",

    "text":"Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.\n\n\"He talks tough on some of these issues,\" Rubio said Dec. 13. \"For example, he was going to \u2018carpet bomb\u2019 ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.\n\nWe decided to fact-check Rubio\u2019s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.\n\nCruz\u2019s vote on Rand Paul\u2019s budget proposal\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Cruz\u2019s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul\u2019s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Paul\u2019s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:\n\n\"This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,\" Paul wrote. \"It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.\"\n\nUnder Paul\u2019s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.\n\nWas Paul\u2019s proposal a \u2018cut\u2019 for defense?\n\nSo why did Rubio refer to Paul\u2019s budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise?\n\n\"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.\n\nBut experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul\u2019s proposal a \"cut.\"\n\n\"Paul\u2019s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president\u2019s budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul\u2019s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama\u2019s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.\n\nChristopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul\u2019s budget a \"cut.\"\n\n\"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\"\n\nCruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.\n\n\"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a \u2018cut\u2019 when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\"\n\nBenjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz\u2019s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul\u2019s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.\n\n\"This was a budget, so it doesn\u2019t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,\" Friedman said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said that the only budget Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio was referring to Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Paul\u2019s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul\u2019s plan when he called it a \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.\n\nHowever, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul\u2019s proposal for defense was below Obama\u2019s request.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.",

    "text":"One in Four Congressman Joe Pitts \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Mar 10, 2016 3 min read -- 3 Listen Share\n\nOne out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than 2,400 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than 4 million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another 435,000 use heroin.\n\nThese facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain.\n\nNo one suffers alone. We don\u2019t have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family, and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community.\n\nAll of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets.\n\nNinety percent of addicts who need treatment don\u2019t get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction.\n\nAt a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has ordered every state police vehicle to carry naloxone, an anti-overdose drug that has already saved hundreds of lives.\n\nCongress likewise is working on a bipartisan basis, with the support of the Obama Administration, to make the system work better.\n\nThis week, the Senate passed comprehensive legislation to address the addiction crisis. The bill was the result of bipartisan effort, and passed with bipartisan support from both of Pennsylvania\u2019s Senators.\n\nIn November, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan bill, the Protecting Our Infants Act, to review federal programs to help the newborns of heroin and opiate addicts. Tragically, thousands of babies are exposed to and addicted to drugs like codeine, morphine, or heroin before they are even born. Doctors are able to take these babies through the withdrawal process, however. Our new law will require the federal government to develop a strategy to address any gaps in current research or programs.\n\nIn 2015, the Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held five hearings on the drug abuse crisis. In October, as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I chaired a two-part hearing at which we heard from experts like the Obama Administration\u2019s drug czar Michael Botticelli and Dr. Kenneth Katz of the Lehigh Valley Health Network.\n\nTheir testimony was as chilling as it was informative. Director Botticelli testified that over the past decade, the number of people treated for overdoses each year, and the number of babies born with neo-natal abstinence syndrome have both tripled. Dr. Katz told us about a number of adolescents in Allentown whom he has seen hospitalized and even killed after trying a new synthetic strand of cannabis.\n\nAt the hearing, we discussed seven bipartisan proposals that would improve federal public health policies and help addicts get treatment. Each of these seven bills deals with a different aspect of the epidemic, because we need a comprehensive plan: not just adequate funding, but targeted funding; not just emergency response, but education and prevention.\n\nThese bills would make a number of changes to existing law. They would expand the number of physicians who can prescribe the drug buprenorphine to addicts, develop best practices and a national awareness campaign, ban certain synthetic drugs, help pregnant women who are addicted, and create a patient tracking pilot program.\n\nWe aren\u2019t finished. Congress will continue to take action on behalf of the families and communities across Pennsylvania and across the country being shattered by this public health crisis. We will work until the system works.\n\n###",

    "text":"July 25, 2010 \u2014 -- TAPPER: Secretary Geithner thanks for joining us. Good to see you.\n\nSo, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIf they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\nThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBen Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.\n\nWe think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.\n\nNow, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.\n\nTAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?\n\nGEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.\n\nTAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --\n\nGEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.\n\nTAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?\n\nGEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.\n\nTAPPER: So, before the election?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.\n\nTAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.\n\nAre you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus?\n\nGEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.\n\nTAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that.\n\nGEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.\n\nNow, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.\n\nTAPPER: By the private sector.\n\nGEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession.\n\nTAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.\n\nGEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical.\n\nAnd you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress.\n\nTAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.\n\nGiven the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.\n\nTAPPER: Many of the details on the Wall Street Reform Bill that President Obama just signed will be determined by regulators. In fact, the bill also gives more power to some regulators, some of the same ones who failed us the last time around.\n\nWhy should we be confident that they're going to get it right either with the rule making or next time there's a crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: Excellent question. But actually, the theory, the basic strategy in this reform bill does not rest on the wisdom of regulators. It does two very important things, though. It'll help consumers make better choices with better disclosure, much more clarity about the terms of the credit card contract or mortgage loan so they get better protection against the risk of being taken advantage of.\n\nBut it also gives authority we did not have to put in place strong constraints on risk taking on all the nation's largest institutions. That authority did not exist before and it was central to what caused the near collapse of the financial system.\n\nTAPPER: Will these powers have allowed you, if had been Secretary of Treasury at the time or your predecessor Hank Paulsen to have staved off the financial crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think there's any reform bill, no law in any country that can prevent all financial crises. But if we had had this authority as a country, it -- we would have been able to limit risk taking and deal with the trauma that came from the stakes these firms made much more easily. It would have caused much less damage. It would have been much less severe, caused much less damage to the basic fortunes Americans and businesses across the country and to our -- and our long term fiscal position.\n\nTAPPER: You eluded to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was created. Many liberals and labor unions and consumer groups say there's one person they want for that job. Elizabeth Warren. The woman who thought it up.\n\nDo you support that idea?\n\nGEITHNER: She is a enormously effective advocate for reform. Probably the most effective advocate for reform for consumers for consumer protection in the country. She has huge credibility and she played a decisive role in helping make the public case for reform and she was early on this, way ahead of everybody else.\n\nTAPPER: 2007 she wrote that -- that -- she came up with that idea.\n\nGEITHNER: And even before that she was pointing out to people the risks of what's happening in the housing market and credit market. So she has enormous credibility and she'd be an excellent leader of that institution. But that's a decision the President's going to make.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the White House say that -- that you've had concerns about her appointment because she she's been a sharp critic of you, she's been a sharp critic of Treasury Department policies. Do you have concerns?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't have concerns and I should say in that context that she has been playing a very important role in providing oversight over the programs we put in place to break the back of this financial crisis. You know, put out this financial fire.\n\nTAPPER: Ken Feinberg issued a report including that U.S. banks paid out $1.6 billion in unwanted -- unwarranted bonuses to top earners during the height of the meltdown. Seventeen banks made these payouts after getting TARP funds, after getting bailout funds.\n\nGEITHNER: It's a -- you know, it really is an incredible thing. And that's what he reminded of which is in early '09, on the basis of performance in '08, in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, firms that had taken support from the government because they could not manage without it still paid out substantial sums of money to people who made the decisions that caused the crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Is there nothing that can be done about this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, you know, he spoke to that earlier this week. What he did do, though, and this was enormously effective was he went and used the authority he had to change behavior going forward. So you didn't have taxpayers' money after he had that authority go to enrich the people that had brought the system to the edge of collapse.\n\nNow, what he's also done and what our responsibility is to make sure these firms can never again go back to paying their executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the country as a whole, the economy as a whole. So, he's done a great job. Very tough judgments. Limited authority in some cases, but he uses authority very well.\n\nTAPPER: Why is it that U.S. automakers when they received bailout funds had to take serious steps to take -- what are called \"haircuts\"? Salary reductions, layoffs. And banks didn't. Banks -- I mean, you had Ken Feinberg supervising their salaries as long as they were receiving TARP money, but then they paid the money back and did whatever they wanted. How come banks didn't have to do that?\n\nGEITHNER: Great question. And that's why we have financial reform. Because we had for the country as a whole, a process of bankruptcy for dealing with failure. We did not have a similar process that could deal with the failure of large financial institutions.\n\nThat was a tragic failure for the country because what it meant is when firms like AIG or Lehman or Bear Stearns manage themselves to the point where they could not survive without the government, we had no tools like bankruptcy to force them to restructure and protect the taxpayer from losses. But what this financial reform will do is to give us that authority. A type of bankruptcy regime that we can use for these large institutions because, again, this is a basic commitment in the bill. Banks should be paying for the cost of bank failures. We don't want the taxpayers paying for the cost of bank failures. And we should have the ability to dismember them, put them out of existence, put them out of their misery without it causing catastrophic damage to the economy as a whole.\n\nTAPPER: The Treasury Department issued a currency report and concluded that China was not manipulating its currency. Very few legislators on Capitol Hill seem to agree with that report, and I'm wondering if you agree with it.\n\nGEITHNER: Well, what China did, and this is the important thing, after a long period of pegging their currency to the dollar, holding their currency constant against the dollar, they have now started to allow it to move upward again to appreciate, to strengthen their response to market forces.\n\nNow, of course, they just started that process. It's just the beginning, and what matters to us and to all of China's trading partners is that they let that currency appreciate, as they did the last time they allowed us to move. What matters to us is how fast and how far they let it go.\n\nTAPPER: But you stand by the idea, stand by the assertion, that China is not manipulating its currency?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. But again, they begin the process of letting it start to reflect market forces. That's very good for China. It's very good for the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, this has been an odd week for the Obama administration -- not necessarily for the Treasury Department, but for the Obama administration, given the whole kerfuffle with Shirley Sherrod and the Agriculture Department. President Obama has said this is a teaching moment for him and his administration. Secretary Vilsack said something similar.\n\nDid you learn anything from watching your colleagues go through this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, as the president said, I think you saw a general rush to judgment everywhere -- in the press and outside the press. And I think I agree with it -- it's something that we should all take some caution from and look at these things carefully. But he spoke to that, I thought, well earlier this week.\n\nTAPPER: Secretary Geithner, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nGEITHNER: Thanks, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: And joining me now is someone who also knows from budget challenges, New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie. Governor, thank you so much. Welcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: I'm happy to be here.\n\nTAPPER: So, Governor, your victory last November in the very blue state of New Jersey was heralded by Republicans nationally, seen as a blueprint for their victories. Now, a lot of Republicans who wanted you to win and admired your campaign said that you won mainly by criticizing incumbent Democratic Governor Corzine, not necessarily by a specific, detailed agenda.\n\nAnd I'm wondering if, first of all, you agree with that. And, second of all, how do you see your victory in the context of what Republicans can do this November?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first off, Jake, I think what we did in New Jersey last year was say very specifically what direction we wanted to take the state in. We said we wanted to have less spending, smaller government, lower taxes, and commonsense regulation that was going to help to grow private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I didn't go line item by line item through the budget during a campaign, and I didn't think it was the right thing to do.\n\nNow, in terms of what it tells us going forward, I think Republicans across the country need to get back to our brand, and I think that is the Republican brand. It's why I became a Republican: less government, lower taxes, less spending, and commonsense regulation that grows private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I think if my win tells anything, it means if we get back to basics as Republicans, then we speak to some of the concerns people have in New Jersey and across the country.\n\nTAPPER: You know, the biggest item on your agenda so far has been dealing with the budget and the huge deficit in New Jersey. Here you are on CNBC.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: We passed a budget that cuts $11 billion from our state's budget, balances it without any new tax increases on the people of the state of New Jersey.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Patrick Murray, director of polling at Monmouth University, says, quote, \"That's a nice talking point, but it's absolutely untrue. There are a lot of legal obligations that the state has that the governor just simply ignored.\" And the Star-Ledger reported, \"Budget analysts say the $11 billion deficit was closed largely by avoiding massive costs. The budget skipped a $3.1 billion payment to the pension fund, continuing a decade-long pattern Christie had criticized, and did not pay $1.7 billion to schools under the state's formula for education aid.\"\n\nSo these billions that you're not funding, are you doing this just by executive fiat? How does this work? Because they're legal obligations, right?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, listen, the legislature passed this budget. The budget I presented on March 16th has $11 billion in less spending than was projected to be done through the Corzine administration.\n\nAnd so Patrick Murray is a pollster, and he's OK as a pollster, but he's not going to be all that great as a governor, because what we did here was we took $1.7 billion less in education funding. Well, a billion of that was federal stimulus money that had been spent in one year by the Corzine administration, and we were left with $1 billion hole. Really what we did was we reduced it by about $820 million in educational spending.\n\nAcross the board, Jake, we had to reduce spending. Every department of state government was cut. And so there are going to be some cuts you make you like and some that you like less, but when you have an $11 billion hole to fill, you have to fill it.\n\nFinally, on pensions, I wasn't going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system. We need pension reform. I passed some already for new hires in March, and now this fall we're going to go after current employees and pension reform and health benefit reform because we're going broke.\n\nTAPPER: Now, one -- in that clip, you said that there were no new tax increases on people of the state of New Jersey, but also your budget did not fund $1 billion in direct property tax rebates, the homestead rebate. That means that people's property taxes are going to go up.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, no, what we did, Jake, was we did a couple of things. First, we changed it from a property tax rebate program to a direct credit. We spent about $20 million a year in processing these checks and borrowing the money to send out to people. We've eliminated that.\n\nAnd what we did was we skipped three-quarters of that payment in the current fiscal year as part of the shared sacrifice that everybody was going to have to make. I wasn't going to cut just programs for the vulnerable; I wasn't going to cut just programs for the rich, but programs for the middle class. Everything had to be cut.\n\nBut that program will be back as a direct tax credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11.\n\nTAPPER: Now, that shared sacrifice -- I mean, is that not a tax increase, even if it's a -- I mean, if you're -- if you're taking away a tax rebate, even temporarily, that's a tax increase, isn't it?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, I don't -- I don't see it that way. And in addition, what we did was we're giving the tools now to municipalities with a 2 percent property tax cap that we passed this July by me calling the legislature back into special session and with the tools that we're going to be passing this fall for them to cut spending even more at the municipal level so that people are not going to see a huge increase over the course of the next four years in their property taxes at all.\n\nTAPPER: OK, there's been a lot of tension between you and teachers, as you've been wielding your budget ax. Here's one example from a recent town hall meeting.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): You're not compensating me for my education and you're not compensating me for my experience. That's...\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, you know what? Then you don't have to do it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Teachers do it because they love it. That's the only reason I do it.\n\nCHRISTIE: That's good. Well, then -- well, and you -- and, listen, and teachers go into knowing what the pay scale is.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: I know you said your issue is with teachers' unions and not with individual teachers, but what do you say to residents of your state who say that they like your stance on taking on the teachers' unions, but a clip like that makes it seems like you don't really respect the teaching profession.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, I do respect the teaching profession. I'm a product of the public schools in the state of New Jersey, and I care deeply about our public education.\n\nBut here's what we can't have any longer: We can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession at the cost to the people who have been hurt by the recession the most.\n\nFor instance, the building trade unions in our state, they have unemployment at 35 percent to 50 percent. They're getting no raises. They're getting no benefits any longer, yet their property taxes continue to go up to pay for 4 percent and 5 percent salary increases demanded by the teachers' unions in a 0 percent inflation world and that most of the teachers in New Jersey, because of their unions, pay nothing towards their health benefits from the day they're hired until the day they die.\n\nNow, I have to tell you, Jake, we can't have one set of rules for one small sector -- the public sector unions -- and a different set of rules for everyone who's being hurt by this recession and say that those people are being hurt the most by the recession. By the way, you pay for this special treatment.\n\nI mean, now, that may be tough talk to people, and it's direct, but candidly, that's what we have to do if we want to get budgets under control in New Jersey and around the country.\n\nTAPPER: You're -- you've been known in the statehouse and nationally for a blunt style. Here's an example of that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: Like it or not, you guys are stuck with me for four years, and I'm going to say things directly. When you ask me questions, I'm going to answer them directly, straightly, bluntly, and nobody in New Jersey is going to have to wonder where I am on an issue.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: That's a high bar, so let's do it. Directly, straightly, bluntly, should New Jersey join the lawsuit that other states have filed against the Obama administration over the individual mandate in the health care reform bill?\n\nCHRISTIE: I have both my attorney general and my commissioner of health studying two things: first, what are the chances of succeeding in the lawsuit? Because with limited resources in New Jersey, I'm not going to throw good money after bad. And, secondly, what's the effect of this 2,000-page bill going to be on the people of New Jersey? When I get answers back from them, I'll make a decision.\n\nTAPPER: What's your impulse?\n\nCHRISTIE: I don't have an impulse. I'm waiting to get briefed on it.\n\nTAPPER: Immigration reform. You've said this issue is too important to demagogue. Who is demagoguing in the Senate right now? And what is the solution to immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first of all, on demagoguing, I wasn't talking about anything that's going on now. That's a 2-year-old quote, and there were some things going on in New Jersey at the time while I was U.S. attorney that I thought was demagoguery, and I called it that.\n\nListen, this issue is a federal issue that should be handled by the feds and should be fixed finally. As a former United States attorney, I had to deal with these issues for seven years, and we simply didn't have the resources to deal with them effectively.\n\nSo the president and the Congress have to step up to the plate, they have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people.\n\nAnd until they do that, states are going to struggle all over the country with this problem, and so is federal law enforcement, who doesn't have the resources to do it effectively.\n\nTAPPER: Is the Republican Party in Congress been a help or hindrance to that cause for immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think it depends on which Republican you're talking about. I don't think the party has had a generalized stance. I think there's been, you know, folks who have been all over the map on this issue. And, candidly, I don't think there's one general Republican position.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there are Democrats offering a bill, and they can't -- they can't get any Republicans to join them.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen, the fact of the matter is that they have to find a way to build consensus. And I think that's what the president said he wanted to do when he came to town, and I think that's the challenge for those who are in the majority: find a way to build consensus.\n\nThat's what I've been doing in New Jersey, Jake. We have a Democratic legislature. I've passed a budget with those $11 billion in cuts with a Democratic legislature, a property tax cap with a Democratic legislature, pension reforms with a Democratic legislature.\n\nIf you want to lead and build consensus, you can, and it's on the obligation of those people in charge to build consensus.\n\nTAPPER: Two more quick questions. One, the stimulus bill. Net positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think short-term positive, and we're now feeling the negative.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, I know you like to talk about New Jersey's cultural icons. You prefer to talk about Springsteen, but the New York Times today has this profile of Snooki from \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: Sure.\n\nTAPPER: MTV's \"Jersey Shore,\" positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: Negative for New Jersey, I mean, because it -- what it does is it takes a bunch of New Yorkers, who are -- most of the people on \"Jersey Shore\" are New Yorkers -- takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them at the Jersey shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey.\n\nI could tell people, they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time. The Jersey shore is a beautiful place, and it's a place that everybody should come on vacation this summer. We've got another six weeks or so of summer left. Come to New Jersey.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Christie, thanks so much for -- for sharing your views.\n\nCHRISTIE: Thank you, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: The roundtable is next with Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Donna Brazile, and Stephen Hayes. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately.\n\nSHERROD: I was faced with having to help a white person save their land, so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.\n\n(UNKNOWN): The full speech has been released by the NAACP, and it backs up Ms. Sherrod's version.\n\nTAPPER: Apparently she's watching this briefing, Shirley Sherrod, on CNN right now. Is there anything you want to say to her?\n\nGIBBS: On behalf of the administration, I offer our apologies.\n\nVILSACK: I asked for Shirley's forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me.\n\n(UNKNOWN): He jumped the gun.\n\nSHERROD: To have people think that I was a racist really, really hurt.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: L'affaire Sherrod, one of the many topics we'll talk about on our roundtable today with Stephen Hayes from the Weekly Standard and Fox News Channel, Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist and our dear friend, and ABC News' own Sam Donaldson, and, of course, Cokie Roberts.\n\nThanks, all of you, for being here.\n\nWe'll get to Sherrod in a second, but first I just want to talk a little bit about the Geithner interview. Secretary Geithner said he hopes there isn't going to be much of a fight over trying to keep the tax cuts for the lower income, under $200,000, $250,000 for a family, but repeal them or let them expire for wealthier Americans. Is there going to be a fight?\n\nHAYES: Yes, hope will only take you so far. I think there will be a fight, and I think one of the main constituencies in the fight is going to be moderate Democrats, as you pointed out in your questioning of him.\n\nI think you're going to see moderate Democrats who walk back from the administration's eagerness to see this tax hike on what they're calling the wealthiest Americans.\n\nTAPPER: Donna?\n\nBRAZILE: The 2011 budget anticipates that we can close the deficit largely by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. I think the president should not get into the argument should he, should he not, but rather to present a series of -- a new tax package. Don't call it Bush tax cuts, but a new tax package that is aimed toward the middle class, towards small businesses, that will close tax loopholes, and to ensure that the -- whatever package we put forward is fiscally prudent, it's paid for, and that it helps spur economic growth.\n\nTAPPER: Sam, where do you think this is going?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, of course, they should continue those tax cuts for 95 percent, as Secretary Geithner said. And as far as the wealthy are concerned to go from 35 percent as the top rate before the deductions to 39 percent is not going to kill them. It really won't. They're going to have something to eat the next day.\n\nBut here's my proposal. There is a point...\n\nTAPPER: A proposal from Sam Donaldson.\n\nDONALDSON: Here's my proposal.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I like that.\n\nDONALDSON: There is a point that at this moment perhaps we should continue to extend the tax cuts across the board, but put in a trigger. When our national product gets better, when our unemployment gets better, use some other indexes. Then the trigger automatically raises it for the wealthy back to 39 percent.\n\nROBERTS: Triggers never work. We've put in triggers -- Congress puts in triggers all the time. It's basically fig leaves, and then they don't -- they don't ever do it.\n\nDONALDSON: The reason it doesn't work, Cokie, is that Congress doesn't follow through.\n\nROBERTS: That's my point.\n\nDONALDSON: I don't think there's a chance that Republicans would agree with my modest suggestion.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... look, it's obviously not just an economic question. It's a political question. And -- and who gets to frame it? Do the Democrats get to say the Republicans claim that they're against the deficit, but they want to keep in all these tax cuts for those really rich people, including those Wall Street bankers who got those huge bonuses, or do the Republicans say, look, here are Democrats going at you again, raising your taxes just so they can -- just so they can raise that spending, because they want the government to take over every -- every part of American life?\n\nAnd I think that's a lot of what this debate will be framed around and what this election will be framed around.\n\nTAPPER: And this debate comes as Ben Bernanke, the Fed chair, is calling the economic outlook unusually uncertain, which is chilling words for some people.\n\nROBERTS: Including the market. I mean, he said those words and 200 points down.\n\nDONALDSON: The market is beginning to start to levitate again, maybe unwisely, but Europe has produced better numbers just this past week. The earnings season looks really good for some of the big companies, not just the banks, but some of the companies, Caterpillar, some of the people who make things. I think we're going to come out of it.\n\nHAYES: But the numbers are mixed. I mean, that's the rosy scenario.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: The numbers are mixed, and there are plenty of numbers that are pointing in the other direction. I think if you look at the big picture, the question I think facing -- facing sort of everybody in Washington right now with respect to the tax cuts, one of the things that surprised me most about your interview with Tim Geithner was that he said raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans won't have a negative effect on growth, that was a stunning statement to me.\n\nI think you could poll 1,000 economists and find very few of them who would agree with what Tim Geithner just said, and one of those people is Christina Romer in the White House, who has written before about the negative effects of tax cuts, and, in fact, has an article...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Of tax increases.\n\nHAYES: ... of tax increases, and has an article in the current American Economic Review, June 2010, in which she says tax increases have a large and substantial negative effect on consumption and growth.\n\nROBERTS: Now, they have to be really especially careful about the estate tax, however, because...\n\nDONALDSON: There is none.\n\nROBERTS: Well, there isn't one at the moment.\n\nTAPPER: There's not right now. And the heirs of George Steinbrenner are happy for that.\n\nROBERTS: Exactly. So then if they bring it back, they'd better do it overnight, you know, so that people aren't doing in their parents in anticipation.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, you wanted to say something?\n\nBRAZILE: Everyone is concerned about the deficit, and that's why we have to be careful how we frame this. I mean, you and I both know that -- Stephen, that over the last 10 years we've seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown. Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, they've seen their wages stagnate.\n\nSo I think the president needs to be wise enough to take a look at the entire array of tax cuts that he could provide to small businesses and middle-income individuals that will help spur economic growth.\n\nROBERTS: But, of course, the one number that matters is the unemployment number. I mean, that is the number that everybody really cares about. And -- and the president himself is now saying, again, expected to get to 8 percent or lower until maybe the end of 2012.\n\nAnd that -- you know, that then becomes not only a dampening -- have a dampening effect on the economy, but that becomes...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: There are two commissions...\n\nROBERTS: ... political problem.\n\nDONALDSON: ... running right now, the presidential commission appointed and a private one with Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin that are looking at this problem of our debt and our economic situation, and both of them say, by the end of the year when they report, we're going to be stunned by the projections for this country if we don't start cutting unnecessary expenses and getting hold of the debt.\n\nROBERTS: Well...\n\nTAPPER: It's not just unnecessary expenses. Some of them are necessary expenses. It's Medicare and Social Security.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... building a second engine for a fighter that the Defense Department says is unnecessary?\n\nROBERTS: Well, you know perfectly well, Sam, that that doesn't save you any money. I mean, you start...\n\nDONALDSON: Oh, a few billion.\n\nROBERTS: You could close down this Capitol or turn it into condos and you could close down every domestic program that we have and you'd still have a deficit because of Social Security, Medicare...\n\nDONALDSON: That's defense spending.\n\nROBERTS: ... and interest on the national debt.\n\nBRAZILE: And the loss of revenues. I mean, this recession has taken a bite out of the economy. We're not collecting money, so we need to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Particularly on capital gains.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right.\n\nHAYES: Which -- which is why the single most important thing the government can do right now is get out of the way of private-sector growth. And raising taxes in a recession on whomever is, I think, one of the most foolish things you could possibly do at this time.\n\nAnd, look, the administration implicitly buys the argument that raising taxes in a recession is a bad idea. You've heard administration officials articulate this before, and it's behind what they did in the original stimulus with the tax cuts.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: So sign on to the idea that now it's a bad idea, but at some point we're going to come out of this recession.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there is -- and there are voices in the administration...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... and now they raised them, OK?\n\nTAPPER: ... talking about -- there are people in the administration talking about maybe just keeping the Bush tax cuts in place for everyone for a year longer...\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's what you were saying.\n\nTAPPER: ... or not, but Geithner said no.\n\nDONALDSON: But a trigger. Otherwise the Congress will never come back and say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: ... have the same debate -- have the same debate in two years.\n\nBRAZILE: I'm going to be like the Republicans for 30 seconds. How do we pay for it? How do we pay for it? We know that the Bush tax cuts is one of the driving forces...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: It is -- it is part of it, but that's on static scoring. If you look at what it does for economic growth, you could argue that you'll make up some of the revenues...\n\nBRAZILE: So how many jobs were created during its period when we had the Bush tax cuts, from 2001 to 2008? How many jobs?\n\nHAYES: I don't -- I don't know the number.\n\nBRAZILE: Hardly any. We lost jobs. That's the point. The point is, we should have tax cuts that help spur economic growth. Bottom line, it's about jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nROBERTS: I think that's right. The question is, what cuts? And not just \"cuts.\" And I think that...\n\nHAYES: Sure, OK. Let's say that small business is the engine for job growth.\n\nBRAZILE: I agree with that.\n\nHAYES: But the people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners. So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can...\n\nDONALDSON: Most of the wealthy...\n\nHAYES: ... put people back to work, that's who you're talking about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... most of the wealthy, the top 3 percent are small-business owners? Wrong. There are some, yes, of course.\n\nBRAZILE: It's less than a quarter.\n\nDONALDSON: Come on, Stephen.\n\nTAPPER: We can have PolitiFact come in and weigh in on that one.\n\nBRAZILE: They will. Trust me.\n\nTAPPER: I do want -- I do want to move to the subject of the unemployed. And by the unemployed, I mean Shirley Sherrod, who is the most notable unemployed person in America right now. The White House says they had nothing to do with it, but Shirley Sherrod on CNN, after speaking to President Obama, said she wasn't so sure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I firmly believe that someone in the White House was telling them that the White House wanted me to resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Donna, the White House says, no, this was all Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's call. Do you believe that?\n\nBRAZILE: They've told me the same story, and...\n\nTAPPER: That's not what I asked you.\n\nBRAZILE: I know.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThey told me the same story, and I'm reluctant -- and I trust the source. My source said we had nothing to do with it, but, you know, once we got on top of it, we moved it.\n\nLook, Ms. Sherrod told a story that is just as amazing as the hymns from \"Amazing Grace.\" It was a story of redemption. And yet we all know from the facts that everyone, everyone -- there's enough pro (ph) to go around to ensure that everyone continue to eat bird until turkey season.\n\nBut the truth is, is that the White House jumped the gun, Fox News and others who allowed this -- this -- this bogus tape to hit the airwaves...\n\nROBERTS: NAACP.\n\nBRAZILE: ... and the NAACP...\n\nTAPPER: The NAACP, absolutely.\n\nBRAZILE: ... that did not call their local chapter, did not confer with Ms. Sherrod, it's a mind-boggling story. I talked to Ms. Sherrod. You know, when you grow up in the deep South, as I did, you know the -- you know the history of the movement and you know the history of the Sherrod family. You know Shirley Sherrod's personal story. I'm ashamed that so many people failed to even just simply Google her name.\n\nROBERTS: But the truth is, the only people who could fire her were the administration. Fox News couldn't fire her. The NAACP couldn't fire her. Only the administration could fire her. So they really bear the most culpability here, I think by a long shot.\n\nBut the other thing that's true is that what she actually did say gets us right back to the last conversation, because what she did say was that the divisions she came to understand were really not between black and white, but between haves and have-nots. And that is really what -- what turned her around and -- and made her fight for that white farmer.\n\nDONALDSON: But I think, except for her, there's enough blame to go around for everyone here. The people who maliciously and with intention misrepresented the facts, I mean, I -- I believe in the First Amendment. There's nothing you can do about them, although you wish for Joseph Welch to say as he did to Joe McCarthy when Joe McCarthy was destroying someone on television, have you no decency, at last?\n\nBut from the standpoint of Obama and the administration, who are these people that they should pay attention to and be afraid of? Who's Glenn Beck? I mean, who's Bill O'Reilly? Who's Brett whatever his name is?\n\nTAPPER: Andrew -- Andrew Breitbart...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: No, let me -- let me finish, because I want to give a little advice, since I've been doing it this morning in economics, to the president.\n\n(UNKNOWN): OK.\n\nDONALDSON: I want to quote another president who also said he had enemies, I'm going to -- of financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sexism. They are unanimous in their hatred for me, and I welcome their hatred, said Franklin Roosevelt, who said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\n\nSo, President Obama, don't be afraid of them. Take them on, and let the people judge. You may lose, but if you lose, you will lose grandly (ph).\n\nTAPPER: This is an argument you hear from a lot of liberal activists and Democratic activists. Josh Marshall, who writes at Talking Points Memo, wrote, speaking of Andrew Breitbart, who -- the blogger, the conservative blogger who originally posted this video, that -- the unfairly edited excerpt, which he says that's the -- that's the way he got it, was in that unfairly edited excerpt, and this is what Josh Marshall wrote.\n\n\"Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify. To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong.\"\n\nStephen, do you think that this -- that liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists or...\n\nHAYES: No, way. They would never do that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean, Donna's colleague, Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this. Senior vice president of news, Michael Clemente, sent out a memo talking about the need to treat this carefully, to gather all the facts.\n\nLook, it's an easy distraction. That's what they want to do. I understand that.\n\nThe basic point, to go back to what Donna said, involves the speech, and the speech was -- you know, for -- for most of the speech, a fantastic speech, a compelling speech, a moving speech. I mean, to hear the stories about Baker County, to hear about her upbringing, to hear about the men who burned crosses in her front yard, is a compelling story. It's incredibly moving.\n\nWhat happened then in the speech was that she slipped into what I think are easy accusations of racism that don't work. She said, in the -- in the middle of her speech...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: This is the speech in March, the March speech, yes.\n\nHAYES: ... the March speech, she talked about Republicans. It's always about money, she said. I haven't seen such mean-spirited people as I've seen lately over the issue of health care. Some of the racism we thought was buried, didn't it surface? Now we've endured eight years of the Bushes, and we didn't do some of the stuff these Republicans are doing because you have a black president.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Bill O'Reilly called for her to be fired. Isn't (ph) he on Fox...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: So did the White House. So did the USDA.\n\nROBERTS: But there was racism that came up during the health care debate, with the -- with the vilification of John Lewis at the Capitol. And -- and the truth is, is that -- you know, this is a conversation we -- we just don't have.\n\nI mean, I really think Eric Holder was right. We are cowardly about talking about race.\n\nI had a cross burned in my front yard, too, and I know what it was like to grow up in the South in those years. And -- and the truth is that the -- that the conversation is just different among whites and among blacks. It is. And we have to be able to address that if we're ever going to get past it as a nation.\n\nIf we have any opportunity to perfect this union, that's what we have to do.\n\nHAYES: I agree with you, but don't you think one of the reasons that we don't have this kind of conversation about race is because of the kind of comments branding Republicans as racists for opposing health care?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: This has -- this has nothing to do...\n\nDONALDSON: Mr. Beck called the president of the United States a racist. What about that?\n\nTAPPER: But is that racist, to say somebody's racist?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, he just said branding people as racists.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: What she was -- what she was saying -- I heard the speech in its entirety, and I went public when I heard the speech. What she was talking about was the political climate, a political climate that, yes, some in the Republican Party have condoned simply because they refuse to repudiate those elements within their party that simply have gone too far, with the birther notion, with his illegitimacy, and creating the kind of racial resentment that prohibits us from having a genuine conversation about race and racism.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, Shirley Sherrod on CNN also said something specifically about Andrew Breitbart from biggovernment.com, the conservative activist who posted the unfairly edited video, and here's what she had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I know I've gotten black versus white. He's probably the person who's never gotten past it and never attempted to get past it. I think he'd like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery. That's where I think he'd like to see all black people end up again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: This woman's been offered a job by the Agriculture Department as a deputy director of the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and she's saying Andrew Breitbart wants to return to the days of slavery.\n\nNow, you can think what Andrew Breitbart did was reprehensible, irresponsible, unfair, and a total smear. Did that justify saying he wants us to go back to the days of slavery?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, you know, I'm not going to -- to second-guess Ms. Sherrod. I know her history. But I am going to say that Mr. Breitbart should resign, even after -- not resign...\n\nROBERTS: From what?\n\nBRAZILE: Sorry, I misspoke. I'm not in the business of asking people to be fired. I've been fired once before. But I think Mr. Breitbart should apologize to her.\n\nI mean, she -- this is a woman who -- her father was murdered, and no one was ever brought to justice. I mean, she has some -- she has some anger that she was talking about, but she also talked about how she got -- you know, how she came to struggle with this and how she went on to -- to -- to start her life anew and fight for farmers of (inaudible)\n\nBut let me just say, going back to this conversation, can we have a conversation about race? Yes. But it cannot start here in Washington. It cannot start with politicians leading the conversation. It must start back in Georgia, where Ms. Sherrod and the Spooners can help lead us in this dialogue.\n\nAnd if Mr. Breitbart would like to be part of it, we welcome him to the conversation.\n\nROBERTS: But it's -- I disagree. I think it can start in Washington, and I think it can start in the White House. And I think that we -- that we have an opportunity -- everybody talks about this being a teachable moment. Well, let's learn and -- and let's have the president be the teacher in -- in chief. And, you know...\n\nDONALDSON: Yes. And Mitch McConnell was asked about an aspect of this, and he says, I don't want to get into that. All right. That's his privilege not to as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate. But it takes all the sides to get into it civilly, not calling names or calling people racists on either side -- you're quite correct -- and talk about it. But it's not going to happen, unfortunately.\n\nBRAZILE: But civil rights used to be a nonpartisan issue.\n\nROBERTS: That's right.\n\nBRAZILE: It wasn't black or white or left versus white. It was Republicans. I keep telling Republicans, it was Republicans who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... listen to the Johnson tapes, when Johnson was ready to sign the civil rights bill, it was, you know, dead of summer, and -- and he's saying to his aides, make sure that the Republicans are here. I'm not going to sign this without Ev Dirksen being in the room, because this is the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Well, Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader...\n\nROBERTS: ... they -- they had so much to do with it.\n\nDONALDSON: Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader of the Senate, made the last speech in favor of breaking the southern filibuster to pass the '64 Civil Rights Act. He quoted Victor Hugo. Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. That's the way the Republicans in the Senate acted.\n\nBRAZILE: But I hope Ms. Sherrod and Mr. Breitbart can sit down and have a -- whatever kind of summit.\n\n(UNKNOWN): A beer summit?\n\nBRAZILE: I don't know what she drinks.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... don't want to get into this.\n\nBRAZILE: But I know that they can find a common language to talk about the future if they can only sit and listen to each other.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, I want to ask you a question about -- Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times suggests that she should -- Shirley Sherrod should be offered a job in the White House. And she also writes this: \"The first black president should expand beyond his campaign security blanket, the smug cordon of overprotective white guys surrounding him. Otherwise, this administration will keep tripping over race, rather than inspiring on race. The president shouldn't give Sherrod her old job back. He should give here a new job, director of black outreach. This White House needs one.\"\n\nWhether or not the job should go to Shirley Sherrod, does this White House need one?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I would hope that the White House could bring in more people, people who understood history, people who could help serve this president. When they hear of a conversation like Ms. Sherrod, hopefully they won't run to the hilltop. They could sit down and say let's -- let's talk about this.\n\nI -- I know from having talked to Valerie Jarrett that she's deeply concerned and that she's working inside the White House to make sure that this never happens again.\n\nDONALDSON: But, Jake, it's not black outreach. Maureen, please, it's outreach on this issue for blacks and whites and people of all colors.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Of all colors.\n\nDONALDSON: To say, all right, we need someone for black outreach is the wrong direction.\n\nTAPPER: Stephen?\n\nHAYES: Well, yes, I mean, I don't think -- I think that Sam's right. I don't think that necessarily creating a new position of black outreach is -- is going to solve the country's problems on race. And certainly after looking at Ms. Sherrod, in spite of her history and the things that she said that were so moving, after seeing her comments about Andrew Breitbart wanting us to go back to slavery, would not be the ideal person for the job.\n\nTAPPER: Cokie, 30 seconds.\n\nROBERTS: Well, no, I think that the basic point that there has been an ignorance in some ways of -- of the immediate past history that some of us lived through of the young people in the White House is true and that -- and that there does need to be a better understanding of that in order to -- to just try to -- to salve the wounds.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Wonderful job, guys. Thank you so much. The roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com and on our new iPad app, where later you can also find our fact checks.

    "text":"2:04 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. I am Jack Dorsey, from Twitter.\n\n\n\nThrough more than 200 million tweets per day, people around the world use Twitter to instantly connect to what's most meaningful to them. In every country -- Egypt and Japan, the UK and the United States -- much of this conversation is made up of everyday people engaging in spirited debate about the future of their countries.\n\n\n\nOur partners at Salesforce Radian6 studied more than a million tweets, discussing our nation's politics over the recent weeks, and they found that America's financial security to be one of the most actively talked about topics on Twitter. They further found that President Obama's name comes up in more than half of these conversations.\n\n\n\nAnd so today this vibrant discussion comes here to the White House and you get to ask the questions. To participate, just open your web browser and go to askObama.Twitter.com. Neither the President or I know the questions that will be asked today. That decision is driven entirely by the Twitter users.\n\n\n\nAnd so let's get the conversation started. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) First of all, everybody can sit down. (Laughter.) It's much easier to tweet from a seated position. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And I understand you want to start the conversation off with a tweeter yourself.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make history here as the first President to live tweet. So we've got a computer over here. (Types in tweet.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: It's only 140 characters. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right, I think I have done this properly. But here's the test.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And you tweeted.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How about that? Not bad. (Applause.) Thank you. So I think my question will be coming up at some point.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So what was your question? Here it is.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here's the question: \"In order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep?\"\n\n\n\nAnd the reason I thought this was an important question is, as all of you know, we are going through a spirited debate here in Washington, but it's important to get the whole country involved, in making a determination about what are the programs that can help us grow, can create jobs, improve our education system, maintain our clean air and clean water, and what are those things that are a waste that we shouldn\u2019t be investing in because they're not helping us grow or create jobs or creating new businesses. And that debate is going to be heating up over the next couple of weeks, so I'd love to hear from the American people, see what thoughts they have.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Excellent. Well, first question comes from a curator in New Hampshire. And we have eight curators around the country helping us pick tweets from the crowd so that we can read them to the President.\n\n\n\nAnd this one comes from William Smith: \"What mistakes have you made in handling this recession and what would you do differently?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's a terrific question. When I first came into office we were facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. So, looking around this room, it's a pretty young room -- it's certainly the worst recession that we've faced in our lifetimes. And we had to act quickly and make some bold and sometimes difficult decisions.\n\n\n\nIt was absolutely the right thing to do to put forward a Recovery Act that cut taxes for middle-class folks so they had more money in their pocket to get through the recession. It was the right thing to do to provide assistance to states to make sure that they didn\u2019t have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters as quickly as they needed to. And it was the right thing to do to try to rebuild our infrastructure and put people back to work building roads and bridges and so forth.\n\n\n\nIt also was the right thing to do, although a tough decision, to save the auto industry, which is now profitable and gaining market share -- the U.S. auto industry -- for the first time in a very long time.\n\n\n\nI think that -- probably two things that I would do differently. One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didn\u2019t realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost 4 million jobs before I was even sworn in.\n\n\n\nAnd so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting people\u2019s expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.\n\n\n\nThe other area is in the area of housing. I think that the continuing decline in the housing market is something that hasn\u2019t bottomed out as quickly as we expected. And so that\u2019s continued to be a big drag on the economy.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up. But of all the things we\u2019ve done, that\u2019s probably been the area that\u2019s been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 27 percent of our questions are in the jobs category, as you can see from the screen over here. Our next question has to do about jobs and technology. It comes from David: \"Tech and knowledge industries are thriving, yet jobs discussion always centers on manufacturing. Why not be realistic about jobs?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s not an either\/or question; it\u2019s a both\/and question. We have to be successful at the cutting-edge industries of the future like Twitter. But we also have always been a country that makes stuff. And manufacturing jobs end up having both higher wages typically, and they also have bigger multiplier effects. So one manufacturing job can support a range of other jobs -- suppliers and the restaurant near the plant and so forth. So they end up having a substantial impact on the overall economy.\n\n\n\nWhat we want to focus on is advanced manufacturing that combines new technology, so research and development to figure out how are we going to create the next Twitter, how are we going to create the next Google, how are we going to create the next big thing -- but make sure that production is here.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s great that we have an Apple that\u2019s creating iPods, iPads and designing them and creating the software, but it would be nice if we\u2019re also making the iPads and the iPods here in the United States, because that's some more jobs that people can work at.\n\n\n\nAnd there are going to be a series of decisions that we\u2019ve got to make. Number one, are we investing in research and development in order to emphasize technology? And a lot of that has to come from government. That's how the Internet got formed. That's how GPS got formed. Companies on their own can\u2019t always finance the basic research because they can\u2019t be assured that they\u2019re going to get a return on it.\n\n\n\nNumber two, we\u2019ve got to drastically improve how we train our workforce and our kids around math and science and technology.\n\n\n\nNumber three, we\u2019ve got to have a top-notch infrastructure to support advanced manufacturing, and we\u2019ve got to look at sectors where we know this is going to be the future. Something like clean energy, for example. For us not to be the leaders in investing in clean energy manufacturing so that wind turbines and solar panels are not only designed here in the United States but made here in the United States makes absolutely no sense. We\u2019ve got to invest in those areas for us to be successful.\n\n\n\nSo you can combine high-tech with manufacturing, and then you get the best of all worlds.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mentioned education. There's a lot of questions coming about education and its impact on the economy. This one in particular is from a curator who is pulling from a student in Ohio, named Dustin: \"Higher ed is necessary for a stronger economy, but for some middle-class Americans it\u2019s becoming too expensive. What can be done?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here is some good news. We\u2019ve already done something that is very significant, and people may not know. As part of a higher education package that we passed last year, what we were able to do was to take away subsidies that were going to banks for serving as middlemen in the student loan program and funnel that to help young people, through Pell Grants and lower rates on student loans. And so there are millions of students who are getting more affordable student loans and grants as a consequence of the steps that we\u2019ve already taken. This is about tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional federal dollars that were going to banks are now going to students directly.\n\n\n\nIn addition, what we\u2019ve said is that starting in 2013, young people who are going to college will not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income in repayment. And that obviously helps to relieve the burden on a lot students -- because, look, I\u2019m a guy who had about $60,000 worth of debt when I graduated from law school, and Michelle had $60,000. And so we were paying a bigger amount every month than our mortgage. And we did that for eight, 10 years. So I know how burdensome this can be.\n\n\n\nI do think that the universities still have a role in trying to keep their costs down. And I think that it\u2019s important -- even if we've got better student loan programs, more grants, if the costs keep on going up then we'll never have enough money, you'll never get enough help to avoid taking on these huge debts. And so working with university presidents to try to figure out, where can you cut costs -- of course, it may mean that the food in the cafeteria is a little worse and the gym is not as fancy. But I think all of us have to figure out a way to make sure that higher education is accessible for everybody.\n\n\n\nOne last point -- I know, Twitter, I\u2019m supposed to be short. (Laughter.) But city -- community colleges is a huge, under-utilized resource, where what we want to do is set up a lifelong learning system where you may have gotten your four-year degree, but five years out you decide you want to go into another field or you want to brush up on new technologies that are going to help you advance. We need to create a system where you can conveniently access community colleges that are working with businesses to train for the jobs that actually exist. That\u2019s a huge area where I think we can make a lot of progress.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mention debt a lot. That\u2019s come up in conversation a lot recently, especially in some of our recent questions, specifically the debt ceiling. And this is formulated in our next question from RenegadeNerd out of Atlanta: \"Mr. President, will you issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling pursuant to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can I just say, RenegadeNerd, that picture is -- captures it all there. (Laughter.) He's got his hand over there, he\u2019s looking kind of confused. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nLet me, as quickly as I can, describe what\u2019s at stake with respect to the debt ceiling. Historically, the United States, whenever it has a deficit, it finances that deficit through the sale of treasuries. And this is a very common practice. Over our lifetimes, typically the government is always running a modest deficit. And Congress is supposed to vote on the amount of debt that Treasury can essentially issue. It\u2019s a pretty esoteric piece of business; typically has not been something that created a lot of controversy.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is, is that Congress is suggesting we may not vote to raise the debt ceiling. If we do not, then the Treasury will run out of money. It will not be able to pay the bills that are owing, and potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn\u2019t mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse.\n\n\n\nSo this is something that we shouldn\u2019t be toying with. What Dexter\u2019s question referred to was there are some people who say that under the Constitution, it\u2019s unconstitutional for Congress not to allow Treasury to pay its bills and are suggesting that this should be challenged under the Constitution.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think we should even get to the constitutional issue. Congress has a responsibility to make sure we pay our bills. We\u2019ve always paid them in the past. The notion that the U.S. is going to default on its debt is just irresponsible. And my expectation is, is that over the next week to two weeks, that Congress, working with the White House, comes up with a deal that solves our deficit, solves our debt problems, and makes sure that our full faith and credit is protected.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So back to jobs. We have a question from New York City about immigrant entrepreneurs: \"Immigrant entrepreneurs can build companies and create jobs for U.S. workers. Will you support a startup visa program?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I want to do is make sure that talented people who come to this country to study, to get degrees, and are willing and interested in starting up businesses can do so, as opposed to going back home and starting those businesses over there to compete against the United States and take away U.S. jobs.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019re working with the business community as well as the entrepreneurial community to figure out are there ways that we can streamline the visa system so if you are studying here, you\u2019ve got a PhD in computer science or you\u2019ve got a PhD in engineering, and you say I\u2019m ready to invest in the United States, create jobs in the United States, then we are able to say to you, we want you to stay here.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that it is possible for us to deal with this problem. But it\u2019s important for us to look at it more broadly. We\u2019ve got an immigration system that\u2019s broken right now, where too many folks are breaking the law but also our laws make it too hard for talented people to contribute and be part of our society. And we\u2019ve always been a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And so we need comprehensive immigration reform, part of which would allow entrepreneurs and high-skilled individuals to stay here -- because we want to be attracting that talent here. We don\u2019t want that -- we don\u2019t want to pay for training them here and then having them benefit other countries.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Our next question was just -- was sent just an hour ago and touches on alternative energy and job creation: \"Will you focus on promoting alternative energy industries in oil states like Louisiana and Texas?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I want to promote alternative energy everywhere, including oil states like Louisiana and Texas. This is something that I\u2019m very proud of and doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history through the Recovery Act. And so we put forward a range of programs that provided credits and grants to startup companies in areas like creating wind turbines, solar panels.\n\n\n\nA great example is advanced battery manufacturing. When I came into office, advanced batteries, which are used, for example, in electric cars, we only accounted for 2 percent of the world market in advanced batteries. And we have quintupled our market share, or even gone further, just over the last two years. And we\u2019re projecting that we can get to 30 to 40 percent of that market. That\u2019s creating jobs all across the Midwest, all across America.\n\n\n\nAnd whoever wins this race on advanced battery manufacturing is probably going to win the race to produce the cars of the 21st century. China is investing in it. Germany is investing in it. We need to be investing in it as well.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: I wanted to take a moment and point out the map just behind you. These are tweets coming in, in real time, and these are questions being asked right now. And it flips between the various categories that we\u2019ve determined and also just general askObama questions.\n\n\n\nSo our next question is coming up on the screen now, from Patrick: \u201cMr. President, in several states we have seen people lose their collective bargaining rights. Do you have a plan to rectify this?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The first thing I want to emphasize is that collective bargaining is the reason why the vast majority of Americans enjoy a minimum wage, enjoy weekends, enjoy overtime. So many things that we take for granted are because workers came together to bargain with their employers.\n\n\n\nNow, we live in a very competitive society in the 21st century. And that means in the private sector, labor has to take management into account. If labor is making demands that make management broke and they can\u2019t compete, then that doesn\u2019t do anybody any good.\n\n\n\nIn the public sector, what is true is that some of the pension plans that have been in place and the health benefits that are in place are so out of proportion with what\u2019s happening in the private sector that a lot of taxpayers start feeling resentful. They say, well, if I don\u2019t have health care where I only have to pay $1 for prescription drugs, why is it that the person whose salary I\u2019m paying has a better deal?\n\n\n\nWhat this means is, is that all of us are going to have to make some adjustments. But the principle of collective bargaining, making sure that people can exercise their rights to be able to join together with other workers and to negotiate and kind of even the bargaining power on either side, that\u2019s something that has to be protected. And we can make these adjustments in a way that are equitable but preserve people\u2019s collective bargaining rights.\n\n\n\nSo, typically, the challenges against bargaining rights have been taking place at the state level. I don't have direct control over that. But what I can do is to speak out forcefully for the principle that we can make these adjustments that are necessary during these difficult fiscal times, but do it in a way that preserves collective bargaining rights. And certainly at the federal level where I do have influence, I can make sure that we make these adjustments without affecting people\u2019s collective bargaining rights.\n\n\n\nI'll give you just one example. We froze federal pay for federal workers for two years. Now, that wasn\u2019t real popular, as you might imagine, among federal workers. On the other hand, we were able to do that precisely because we wanted to prevent layoffs and we wanted to make sure that we sent a signal that everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices, including federal workers.\n\n\n\nBy the way, people who work in the White House, they\u2019ve had their pay frozen since I came in, our high-wage folks. So they haven\u2019t had a raise in two and a half years, and that's appropriate, because a lot of ordinary folks out there haven\u2019t, either. In fact, they\u2019ve seen their pay cut in some cases.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 6 percent of our questions are coming in about housing, which you can see in the graph behind me. And this one in particular has to do with personal debt and housing: \u201cHow will admin work to help underwater homeowners who aren\u2019t behind in payments but are trapped in homes they can\u2019t sell?\u201d From Robin.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is a great question. And remember, I mentioned one of our biggest challenges during the course of the last two and a half years has been dealing with a huge burst of the housing bubble.\n\n\n\nWhat's happened is a lot of folks are underwater, meaning their home values went down so steeply and so rapidly that now their mortgage, the amount they owe, is a lot more than the assessed worth of their home. And that obviously burdens a lot of folks. It means if they\u2019re selling, they\u2019ve got to sell at a massive loss that they can\u2019t afford. It means that they don\u2019t feel like they have any assets because the single biggest asset of most Americans is their home.\n\n\n\nSo what we\u2019ve been trying to do is to work with the issuers of the mortgages, the banks or the service companies, to convince them to work with homeowners who are paying, trying to do the right thing, trying to stay in their homes, to see if they can modify the loans so that their payments are lower, and in some cases, maybe even modify their principal, so that they don\u2019t feel burdened by these huge debts and feel tempted to walk away from homes that actually they love and where they\u2019re raising their families.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made some progress. We have, through the programs that we set up here, have probably seen several million home modifications either directly because we had control of the loan process, or because the private sector followed suit. But it\u2019s not enough. And so we\u2019re going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And our next question comes from someone you may know. This is Speaker Boehner.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you go. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: \u201cAfter embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?\u201d And I want to note that these characters are his fault. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all --\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Not his fault, not his fault.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- John obviously needs to work on his typing skills. (Laughter.) Well, look, obviously John is the Speaker of the House, he\u2019s a Republican, and so this is a slightly skewed question. (Laughter.) But what he\u2019s right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. I mean, we lost, as I said, 4 million jobs before I took office, before I was sworn in. About 4 million jobs were lost in the few months right after I took office before our economic policies had a chance to take any effect.\n\n\n\nAnd over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve actually seen two million jobs created in the private sector. And so we\u2019re each month seeing growth in jobs, But when you\u2019ve got a 8 million dollar -- 8-million-job hole and you\u2019re only filling it 100,000-200,000 jobs at a time each month, obviously that\u2019s way too long for a lot of folks who are still out of work.\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of things that we can continue to do. I actually worked with Speaker Boehner to pass a payroll tax cut in December that put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of almost every single American. That means they\u2019re spending money. That means that businesses have customers. And that has helped improve overall growth.\n\n\n\nWe have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling, including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they\u2019re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve been able to cooperate with Republicans on a range of these issues. There are some areas where the Republicans have been more resistant in cooperating, even though I think most objective observers think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019ll give you a specific example.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that we have about $2 trillion worth of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. Roads, bridges, sewer lines, water mains; our air traffic control system doesn\u2019t make sense. We don\u2019t have the kind of electric grid that\u2019s smart, meaning it doesn\u2019t waste a lot of energy in transmission. Our broadband system is slower than a lot of other countries.\n\n\n\nFor us to move forward on a major infrastructure initiative where we\u2019re putting people to work right now -- including construction workers who were disproportionately unemployed when the housing bubble went bust -- to put them to work rebuilding America at a time when interest rates are very low, contractors are looking for work, and the need is there, that is something that could make a huge, positive impact on the economy overall. And it\u2019s an example of making an investment now that ends up having huge payoffs down the road.\n\n\n\nWe haven\u2019t gotten the kind of cooperation that I\u2019d like to see on some of those ideas and initiatives. But I\u2019m just going to keep on trying and eventually I\u2019m sure the Speaker will see the light. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Speaking of startups, there\u2019s a ton of questions about small businesses and how they affect job creation. This one comes from Neal: \u201cSmall biz create jobs. What incentives are you willing to support to improve small business growth?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I just mentioned some of the tax breaks that we\u2019ve provided not only to small businesses, but also in some cases were provided big businesses. For example, if they\u2019re making investments in plants and equipment this year, they can fully write down those costs, take -- essentially depreciate all those costs this year and that saves them a pretty big tax bill. So we\u2019re already initiating a bunch of steps.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge that I hear from small businesses right now actually has to do with financing, because a lot of small businesses got their financing from community banks. Typically, they\u2019re not getting them from the big Wall Street banks, but they\u2019re getting them from their various regional banks in their communities. A lot of those banks were pretty over-extended in the commercial real estate market, which has been hammered. A lot of them are still digging themselves out of bad loans that they made that were shown to be bad during the recession.\n\n\n\nAnd so, what we\u2019ve tried to do is get the Small Business Administration, the federal agency that helps small businesses, to step in and to provide more financing -- waiving fees, seeing if we can lower interest rates in some cases, making sure that the threshold for companies that qualify for loans are more generous. And that\u2019s helped a lot of small businesses all across the country. And this is another example of where, working with Congress, my hope is, is that we can continue to provide these tax incentives and maybe do even a little bit more.\n\n\n\nQ Our next question was tweeted less than five minutes ago and comes to us from Craig: \u201cMy question is, can you give companies a tax break if they hire an honorable discharged veteran?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is something that I\u2019ve been talking a lot about internally. We\u2019ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn\u2019t serve. And that makes no sense.\n\n\n\nSo what we\u2019d like to do is potentially combine a tax credit for a company that hires veterans with a campaign to have private companies step up and do the right thing and hire more veterans. And one of the things that we\u2019ve done is internally in the federal government we have made a huge emphasis on ramping up our outreach to veterans and the hiring of veterans, and this has been a top priority of mine. The notion that these guys who are sacrificing for our freedom and our security end up coming home and not being able to find a job I think is unacceptable.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, this next question comes from someone else you may recognize. And what's interesting about this question, it was heavily retweeted and voted up by our userbase. This comes from NickKristof: \u201cWas it a mistake to fail to get Republicans to commit to raise the debt ceiling at the same time tax cuts were extended?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nicholas is a great columnist. But I have to tell you the assumption of the question is, is that I was going to be able to get them to commit to raising the debt ceiling.\n\n\n\nIn December, we were in what was called the lame duck session. The Republicans knew that they were going to be coming in as the majority. We only had a few short weeks to deal with a lot of complicated issues, including repealing \"don't ask, don't tell,\" dealing with a START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and come to terms with a budget. And what we were able to do was negotiate a package where we agreed to do something that we didn\u2019t like but that the Republicans badly wanted, which is to extend the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy for another two years.\n\n\n\nIn exchange, we were able to get this payroll tax that put $1,000 -- tax cut that put $1,000 in the pockets of every American, which would help economic growth and jobs. We were also able to get unemployment insurance extended for the millions of Americans out there who are still out of work and whose benefits were about to run out. And that was a much better deal than I think a lot of people expected.\n\n\n\nIt would have been great if we were able to also settle this issue of the debt ceiling at that time. That wasn\u2019t the deal that was available. But here\u2019s the more basic point: Never in our history has the United States defaulted on its debt. The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners, or oil and gas companies that are making billions of dollars because the price of gasoline has gone up so high.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m happy to have those debates. I think the American people are on my side on this. What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where everything is on the table. We need to reduce corporate loopholes. We need to reduce discretionary spending on programs that aren\u2019t working. We need to reduce defense spending. Everything has -- we need to look at entitlements, and we have to say, how do we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for not just this generation but also future generations. And that\u2019s going to require some modifications, even as we maintain its basic structure.\n\n\n\nSo what I\u2019m hoping to see over the next couple of weeks is people put their dogmas aside, their sacred cows aside; they come together and they say, here\u2019s a sensible approach that reduces our deficit, makes sure that government is spending within its means, but also continues to make investments in education, in clean energy, and basic research that are going to preserve our competitive advantage going forward.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So speaking of taxes, our next question is coming from us -- from Alabama, from Lane: \"What changes to the tax system do you think are necessary to help solve the deficit problem and for the system to be fair?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, first of all, it\u2019s important for people to realize that since I\u2019ve been in office I\u2019ve cut taxes for middle-class families, repeatedly. The Recovery Act cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The payroll tax cut that we passed in December put an extra thousand dollars in the pockets of every family in America.\n\n\n\nAnd so we actually now have the lowest tax rates since the 1950s. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They\u2019re lower than they were under George Bush -- senior or George Bush, junior. They\u2019re lower than they were under Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe question is how do we pay for the things that we all think are important and how do we make sure that the tax system is equitable? And what I\u2019ve said is that in addition to eliminating a whole bunch of corporate loopholes that are just not fair -- the notion that corporate jets should get a better deal than commercial jets, or the notion that oil and gas companies that made tens of billions of dollars per quarter need an additional break to give them an incentive to go drill for oil -- that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is people like me who have been incredibly fortunate, mainly because a lot of folks bought my book -- (laughter) -- for me to be able to go back to the tax rate that existed under Bill Clinton, to pay a couple of extra percentage points so that I can make sure that seniors still have Medicare or kids still have Head Start, that makes sense to me. And, Jack, we haven\u2019t talked about this before, but I\u2019m assuming it makes sense to you, given Twitter has done pretty well. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nI think that for us to say that millionaires and billionaires can go back to the tax rate that existed when Bill Clinton was President, that doesn\u2019t affect middle-class families who are having a tough time and haven\u2019t seen their incomes go up. It does mean that those who are in the top 1-2 percent, who have seen their incomes go up much more quickly than anybody else, pays a little bit more in order to make sure that we can make the basic investments that grow this country -- that\u2019s not an unreasonable position to take. And the vast majority of Americans agree with me on that.\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we can just continue spending anything we want. We\u2019re still going to have to make some tough decisions about defense spending, or even some programs that I like but we may not need. But we can\u2019t close the deficit and debt just by cutting things like Head Start or Medicare. That can\u2019t be an equitable solution to solving the problem. And then, we say to millionaires and billionaires, you don\u2019t have to do anything. I don\u2019t want a $200,000 tax break if it means that some senior is going to have to pay $6,000 more for their Medicare that they don\u2019t have, or a bunch of kids are going to be kicked off of Head Start and aren\u2019t going to get the basics that they need in order to succeed in our society. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for me; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the country.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So we have a follow-up question to your answer about homeowners being underwater. And this one came in under 10 minutes ago from Shnaps: \"Is free-market an option? Obama on homeowners underwater: have made some progress, but plus needed looking at options.\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, when Shnaps -- (laughter) -- when Shnaps talks about free market options, I mean, keep in mind that most of this is going to be a function of the market slowly improving because people start having more confidence in the economy; more people decide, you know what, the housing market has kind of bottomed out, now is the time to buy. They start buying. That starts slowly lifting up prices, and you get a virtuous cycle going on.\n\n\n\nSo a lot of this is going to be determined by how well the overall economy does: Do people feel more confident about jobs? Do they feel more confident that they\u2019re going to be able to make their mortgage? And given the size of the housing market, no federal program is going to be able to solve the housing problem. Most of this is going to be free market.\n\n\n\nThe one thing that we can do it make sure that for homeowners who have been responsible, didn\u2019t buy more house than they could afford, had some tough luck because they happened to buy at the top of the market, can afford to continue to pay for that house, can afford their current mortgage, but need some relief, given the drop in value -- that we try to match them up with bankers so that each side ends up winning. The banker says, you know, I\u2019m going to be better off than if this house is foreclosed upon and I have to sell it at a fire sale. The mortgage owner is able to stay in their home, but still pay what\u2019s owed.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that that kind of adjustment and negotiation process is tough. It\u2019s difficult partly because a lot of banks these days don\u2019t hold mortgages. They were all sold to Wall Street and were sliced and diced in these complex financial transactions. So sorting through who owns what can be very complicated. And as you know, some of the banks didn\u2019t do a very good job on filing some of their papers on these foreclosure actions, and so there\u2019s been litigation around that.\n\n\n\nBut the bottom line is we should be able to make some progress on helping some people, understanding that some folks just bought more home than they could afford and probably they\u2019re going to be better off renting.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So 10 percent of our questions now are about education, and this one was surfaced from our curator in California by Marcia: \u201cPublic education here in California is falling apart, not graduating enough skilled workers or smart citizens. Privatization looming?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, when America was making a transition from an agricultural society to an industrial society, we as a country made a decision that we were going to have public high schools that would upgrade the skills of young people as they were leaving the farms and start participating in a more complex industrial economy. When my grandfather\u2019s generation came back from World War II, we made a decision that we were going to have a GI Bill that would send these young people to college because we figured that would help advance our economy.\n\n\n\nEvery time we\u2019ve made a public investment in education, it has paid off many times over. For us now to give short shrift to education when the world is more complex than ever, and it\u2019s a knowledge-based society and companies locate based on whether they\u2019ve got skilled workforces or not, that makes no sense.\n\n\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve got to get our priorities straight here. It is important for us to have a healthy business climate, to try to keep taxes low, to make sure that we\u2019re not spending on things that don\u2019t work. It\u2019s important that we get a good bang for the buck in education. And so my administration has pushed more reform more vigorously across the country through things like Race to the Top than most previous administrations have been able to accomplish. So we don\u2019t just need more money; we need more reform.\n\n\n\nBut we do have to pay for good teachers. Young, talented people aren\u2019t going to go into teaching if they\u2019re getting paid a poverty wage. We do have to make sure that buildings aren\u2019t crumbling. It's pretty hard for kids to concentrate if there are leaks and it\u2019s cold and there are rats running around in their schools. And that\u2019s true in a lot of schools around the country.\n\n\n\nWe do have to make sure that there are computers in a computer age inside classrooms, and that they work and that there\u2019s Internets that are actually -- there are Internet connections that actually function.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that those states that are going to do well and those countries that do well are the ones that are going to continue to be committed to making education a priority.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: We have another follow-up sent about 10 minutes ago in response to your answer on Vietnam vets. From Brendan: \u201cWe definitely need to get more vets into jobs, but when are we going to support the troops by cutting oil dependence?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Reducing our dependence on oil is good for our economy, it\u2019s good for our security, and it\u2019s good for our planet -- so it\u2019s a \"three-fer.\" And we have not had a serious energy policy for decades. Every President talks about it; we don\u2019t get it done.\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019d like to see robust legislation in Congress that actually took some steps to reduce oil dependency. We\u2019re not going to be able to replace oil overnight. Even if we are going full-throttle on clean energy solutions like solar and wind and biodiesel, we\u2019re going to need oil for some time. But if we had a goal where we\u2019re just reducing our dependence on oil each year in a staggered set of steps, it would save consumers in their pocketbook; it would make our businesses more efficient and less subject to the whims of the spot oil market; it would make us less vulnerable to the kinds of disruptions that have occurred because of what happened in the Middle East this spring; and it would drastically cut down on our carbon resources.\n\n\n\nSo what I -- unfortunately, we have not seen a sense of urgency coming out of Congress over the last several months on this issue. Most of the rhetoric has been about, let\u2019s produce more. Well, we can produce more, and I\u2019m committed to that, but the fact is, we only have 2 to 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves; we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. We can\u2019t drill our way out of this problem.\n\n\n\nWhat we can do that we\u2019ve already done administratively is increase fuel-efficiency standards on cars, just to take one example. That will save us millions of barrels of oil, just by using existing technologies and saying to car companies, you can do better than 10 miles a gallon or 15 miles a gallon. And you\u2019re starting to see Detroit respond. U.S. car companies have figured out, you know what, if we produce high-quality electric vehicles, if we produce high-quality low gas -- or high gas mileage vehicles, those will sell.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re actually starting to see market share increase for American cars in subcompact and compact cars for the first time in many years. And that\u2019s partly because we increased fuel-efficiency standards through an administrative agreement. It\u2019s also because, as part of the deal to bail out the oil companies, we said to them, start focusing on the cars of the future instead of looking at big gas guzzlers of the past.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So all of our questions now are coming in real time -- this one less than 10 minutes ago, and surfaced from a curator: \"So will you raise taxes on the middle class at least to President George W. Bush levels?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s make permanent the Bush tax cuts for low and moderate income folks -- people in -- for the 98 percent of people who, frankly, have not seen their wages go up or their incomes go up over the last decade. They don\u2019t have a lot of room; they\u2019re already struggling to meet the rising cost of health care and education and gas prices and food prices.\n\n\n\nIf all we do is just go back to the pre-Bush tax cut rates for the top income brackets, for millionaires and billionaires, that would raise hundreds of billions of dollars. And if you combine it with the cuts we\u2019ve already proposed, we could solve our deficit and our debt problems.\n\n\n\nThis is not something that requires radical solutions. It requires some smart, common-sense, balanced approaches. I think that\u2019s what the American people are looking for and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve proposed. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to keep on trying to bring the parties together to agree to, is a balanced approach that has more cuts than revenue, but has some revenue, and that revenue should come from the people who can most afford it.\n\n\n\nQ So a slight deviation from the economy -- we have a lot of questions, and this will be our last before we start reading some responses to your question -- about the space program. And this one from Ron: \"Now that the space shuttle is gone, where does America stand in space exploration?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We are still a leader in space exploration. But, frankly, I have been pushing NASA to revamp its vision. The shuttle did some extraordinary work in low-orbit experiments, the International Space Station, moving cargo. It was an extraordinary accomplishment and we\u2019re very proud of the work that it did. But now what we need is that next technological breakthrough.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re still using the same models for space travel that we used with the Apollo program 30, 40 years ago. And so what we\u2019ve said is, rather than keep on doing the same thing, let\u2019s invest in basic research around new technologies that can get us places faster, allow human space flight to last longer.\n\n\n\nAnd what you\u2019re seeing now is NASA I think redefining its mission. And we\u2019ve set a goal to let\u2019s ultimately get to Mars. A good pit stop is an asteroid. I haven\u2019t actually -- we haven\u2019t identified the actual asteroid yet, in case people are wondering. (Laughter.) But the point is, let\u2019s start stretching the boundaries so we\u2019re not doing the same thing over and over again, but rather let\u2019s start thinking about what\u2019s the next horizon, what\u2019s the next frontier out there.\n\n\n\nBut in order to do that, we\u2019re actually going to need some technological breakthroughs that we don\u2019t have yet. And what we can do is for some of this low-orbit stuff, some of the more routine space travel -- obviously no space travel is routine, but it could become more routine over time -- let\u2019s allow the private sector to get in so that they can, for example, send these low-Earth orbit vehicles into space and we may be able to achieve a point in time where those of you who are just dying to go into space, you can buy a ticket, and a private carrier can potentially take you up there, while the government focuses on the big breakthroughs that require much larger investments and involve much greater risk.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So, Mr. President, we received a lot of responses to your question over the last hour. And we wanted to go through seven of them that we picked out and just spend some time giving feedback on each. This one from Brian: \"Cut defense contracting, end war on drugs, eliminate agribiz and big oil subsidies, invest in public campaign financing.\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s not a bad list. (Laughter.) The defense contracting is something we\u2019re already making progress on.\n\n\n\nI think with respect to the war on drugs, what we\u2019ve always said is that investing in prevention, reducing demand, is going to be the most cost-effective thing that we can do. We still have to interdict the big drug kingpins and we still have to enforce our drug laws. But making sure that we\u2019re spending more on prevention and treatment can make a huge difference.\n\n\n\nWith respect to some of these big agribusiness and big oil subsidies, those are the examples of the kinds of loopholes we can close. And public campaign financing is something that I\u2019ve supported in the past. There is no doubt that money has an impact on what happens here in Washington. And the more we can reduce money\u2019s impact on Washington, the better off we\u2019re going to be.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Our next response from Elizabeth in Chicago: \u201cStop giving money to countries that waste it -- Pakistan. Keep military, share the wealth between branches, and don\u2019t cut education.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know, the one thing I would say is, on the notion of giving money to countries that waste it -- and Pakistan is listed there -- I think it\u2019s important for people to know that foreign aid accounts for less than 2 percent of our budget. And if you defined it just narrowly as the kind of foreign aid to help feed people and what we think of classically as foreign aid, it\u2019s probably closer to 1 percent.\n\n\n\nSo sometimes people have an exaggerated sense that we spend 25 percent of the federal budget on foreign aid. It\u2019s a tiny amount that has a big impact. And I think America, to be a leader in the world, to have influence, to help stabilize countries and create opportunity for people so that they don\u2019t breed terrorists or create huge refugee flows and so forth, it\u2019s smart for us to make a very modest investment in foreign aid. It\u2019s a force multiplier and it\u2019s something that even in tough fiscal times America needs to continue to do as part of our role as a global leader.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: This next one is pretty simple, from Daniel: \u201cWe need to raise taxes, period.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: As I said before, if wealthy individuals are willing to simply go back to the rates that existed back in the 1990s when rich people were doing very well -- it\u2019s not like they were poor -- and by the way, that\u2019s when we saw the highest job growth rates and that\u2019s when we saw the highest -- the greatest reduction in poverty, and that\u2019s when we saw businesses very profitable -- if the wealthiest among us -- and I include myself in this category -- are willing to give up a little bit more, then we can solve this problem. It does not take a lot.\n\n\n\nAnd I just have to say, when people say, job-killing tax increases, that\u2019s what Obama is proposing, we\u2019re not going to -- you\u2019re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. And the facts are that a modest increase for wealthy individuals is not shown to have an adverse impact on job growth.\n\n\n\nI mean, we can test the two theories. You had what happened during the \u201890s -- right? Taxes for wealthy individuals were somewhat higher, businesses boomed, the economy boomed, great job growth. And then the 2000s, when taxes were cut on wealthy individuals, jobs didn\u2019t grow as fast, businesses didn\u2019t grow as fast. I mean, it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t tried what these other folks are pitching. It didn\u2019t work. And we should go with what works.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So our next response -- we have about nine minutes left and four more responses -- this one from Tammy: \u201cCut military spending on oil subsidies and keep education investments.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I agree with this. The one thing I\u2019ll say about military spending -- we\u2019ve ended the war in Iraq, our combat mission there, and our -- all our troops are slated to be out by the end of this year. We\u2019ve already removed 100,000. I announced that we were going to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan and pivot to a transition process where Afghans are taking more responsibility for their defense.\n\n\n\nBut we have to do all of this in a fairly gradual way. We can\u2019t simply lop off 25 percent off the defense budget overnight. We have to think about all the obligations we have to our current troops who are in the field, and making sure they\u2019re properly equipped and safe. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we are meeting our commitments for those veterans who are coming home. We\u2019ve got to make sure that -- in some cases, we\u2019ve got outdated equipment that needs to be replaced.\n\n\n\nAnd so I\u2019m committed to reducing the defense budget, but as Commander-in-Chief, one of the things that we have to do is make sure that we do it in a thoughtful way that\u2019s guided by our security and our strategic needs. And I think we can accomplish that. And the nice thing about the defense budget is it\u2019s so big, it\u2019s so huge, that a 1 percent reduction is the equivalent of the education budget. Not -- I\u2019m exaggerating, but it\u2019s so big that you can make relatively modest changes to defense that end up giving you a lot of head room to fund things like basic research or student loans or things like that.\n\n\n\nQ Our next response from southwest Ohio, Mostlymoderate: \u201cCut subsidies to industries which are no longer in crisis or are unsuccessful, cotton, oil, corn subsidies from ethanol.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there\u2019s been a interesting debate taking place in Congress recently. I\u2019m a big supporter of biofuels. But one of the things that's become clear is, is that we need to accelerate our basic research in ethanol and other biofuels that are made from things like woodchips and algae as opposed to just focusing on corn, which is probably the least efficient energy producer of these various other approaches.\n\n\n\nAnd so I think that it\u2019s important for even those folks in farm states who traditionally have been strong supporters of ethanol to examine are we, in fact, going after the cutting-edge biodiesel and ethanol approaches that allow, for example, Brazil to run about a third of its transportation system on biofuels. Now, they get it from sugar cane and it\u2019s a more efficient conversion process than corn-based ethanol. And so us doing more basic research in finding better ways to do the same concept I think is the right way to go.\n\n\n\nQ I believe you addressed this next one, so we\u2019re going to skip past it.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I did.\n\n\n\nQ But from Ryan: \u201cI would cut defense spending.\u201d\n\n\n\nQ And James: \u201cI\u2019d cut costs by cutting some welfare programs. People will never try harder when they are handed everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here\u2019s what I would say. I think we should acknowledge that some welfare programs in the past were not well-designed and in some cases did encourage dependency. And as somebody who worked in low-income neighborhoods, I\u2019ve seen it, where people weren\u2019t encouraged to work, weren\u2019t encouraged to upgrade their skills, were just getting a check, and over time their motivation started to diminish. And I think even if you\u2019re progressive, you\u2019ve got to acknowledge that some of these things have not been well-designed.\n\n\n\nI will say that today, welfare payments are not the big driver of our deficit or our debt. There are work obligations attached to welfare, that the vast majority of folks who are getting welfare want to work but can\u2019t find jobs. And what we should be doing is in all our social programs evaluating what are upgrading people\u2019s skills, giving them the tools they need to get into the workforce, nudging them into the workforce but letting them know that we\u2019re there to support you and encourage you as long as you\u2019re showing the kind of responsibility for being willing to work that every American should be expected to show.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m somebody who believes that we can constantly improve any program, whether it\u2019s a defense program -- those who say that we can\u2019t cut military at all, they haven\u2019t spent a lot of time looking at military budgets. Those who say that we can\u2019t make any changes to our social welfare programs or else you\u2019re being mean to poor people, that\u2019s not true. There are some programs that can always be improved. And some programs, if they don\u2019t work, we should have the courage to eliminate them, and then use that money to put it into the programs that do work.\n\n\n\nBut the bottom line is that our core values of responsibility, opportunity, making sure that the American Dream is alive and well so that anybody who is willing to put in the time and the effort and the energy are able to get a good education in this society, find a job that pays a living wage, that they\u2019re able to send their kids to college without going broke, that they\u2019ve got basic health care, they\u2019re going to be able to retire with some dignity and some respect, that that opportunity is open to anybody regardless of race or religion or sexual orientation -- that that basic principle, that\u2019s what holds us together. That\u2019s what makes us Americans.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not all tied together by ethnicity or a single religion. What ties us together is this idea that everybody has got a shot. As long as you carry out your responsibilities, you can make it. You can get into the middle class and beyond. And you can start a company and suddenly help bring the whole world together. That\u2019s what makes this country outstanding.\n\n\n\nBut in order to do that, it requires us to both have a commitment to our individualism and our freedom and our creativity and our idiosyncrasies. But it also requires us to have a commitment to each other, and recognize that I would not be President if somebody hadn\u2019t helped provide some scholarships for my school, and you would not have Twitter if the Department of Defense, at some point, and a bunch of universities hadn\u2019t made some investments in something that ended up being the Internet. And those were public goods that were invested in.\n\n\n\nSo you and I are sitting here because somebody, somewhere, made an investment in our futures. We\u2019ve got the same obligation for the folks who are coming up behind us. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re looking out for them, just like the previous generations looked out for us. And that\u2019s what I think will help us get through what are some difficult times and make sure that America\u2019s future is even brighter than the past.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And on that note, thank you very much, Mr. President. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. (Applause.) All right, thank you, guys. Thanks.

    "text":"Apparently, back when President Barack Obama would get high with the Choom Gang, he was tokin\u2019 on some weak product by today\u2019s standards.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what one former congressman says.\n\nAfter Obama told The New Yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol \u2014 which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug that\u2019s on the federal government\u2019s most restrictive list, Schedule I \u2014 former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge.\n\n\"I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse,\" said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director \"would tell the president that, in fact, today\u2019s modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person.\"\n\nObama\u2019s exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently , in journalist David Maraniss\u2019 biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang \u2014 friends from Hawaii who frequently got high.\n\nBut has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate.\n\nWhat is THC?\n\nCannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant.\n\nThe level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC.\n\nTHC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years.\n\nBut what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent?\n\nThe answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time.\n\nThe University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period.\n\nBack in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss.\n\nFurther, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007.\n\nBut while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn\u2019t likely to increase, ElSohly said.\n\nHow did it get so strong?\n\nThe former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. That\u2019s not quite right.\n\nGenetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substance\u2019s DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market don\u2019t have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications.\n\nHowever, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes.\n\nGenetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost.\n\nCultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC.\n\nThere is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but it\u2019s not widespread yet and it\u2019s not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nWhat does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? Let\u2019s start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency.\n\nNoting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that \"daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago.\"\n\nResearchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned.\n\nThose concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia.\n\nBut for the average adult recreational or habitual user, there\u2019s a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean.\n\nOnly a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level.\n\nIn that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs.\n\nRoger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don\u2019t know everything about its potential impact.\n\nBeyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks.\n\nHospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors.\n\nThis is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling.\n\nOur ruling\n\nKennedy said that marijuana today is \"genetically modified,\" with THC levels that \"far surpass the marijuana\" of the 1970s.\n\nGenerally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since Obama\u2019s youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuana\u2019s negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of Kennedy\u2019s claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from \"genetic modification.\" It\u2019s actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",

We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.\n\nWOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you're going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.\n\nIFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight.\n\nThis is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you're watching -- whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or neither -- because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too.\n\nWith that, let's welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nVery good to be here with you.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\nIFILL: Welcome to you both.\n\nWOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.\n\nIFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America's heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let's turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.\n\nSANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you.\n\nNine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.\n\nSANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.\n\nAnd then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them.\n\nI think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nThank you.\n\nIFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n\nSecretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years. There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.\n\nWe both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.\n\nBut I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.\n\nHardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.\n\nWOODRUFF: Thank you both.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we'll be right back after a short break to begin questions.\n\nWOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let's get right to the questions.\n\nSenator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.\n\nWhat I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.\n\nI do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.\n\nWOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...\n\nSANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living. CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.\n\nLast week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.\n\nSANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.\n\nI have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We're not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth.\n\nTwenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.\n\nIn my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.\n\nCLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.\n\nAnd it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.\n\nSo if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.\n\nIFILL: Final thought, Senator.\n\nSANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.\n\nPlease do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.\n\nAnd we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: I'd like to move along. I'd like to move along.\n\nSecretary Clinton, you might -- you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: \"The era of big government is over.\" You may remember that.\n\nWhen asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?\n\nCLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?\n\nIn my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.\n\nI've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I'm aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.\n\nCLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.\n\nIFILL: But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your -- you say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.\n\nAnd I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.\n\nBut I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.\n\nIFILL: Senator?\n\nSANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?\n\nWho denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.\n\nWe need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.\n\nYes, I'm going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.\n\nYes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.\n\nWe bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.\n\nWe differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.\n\nAnd Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Next, we're going to...\n\nSANDERS: A brief response.\n\nWOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.\n\nSANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.\n\nAnd that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.\n\nSo, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign -- you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.\n\nBut in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.\n\nAnd I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I'm going to keep making that case. I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.\n\nBut I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That's what I'm working towards.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women. Do you agree with what she said?\n\nCLINTON: Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That's what I've always stood for.\n\nAnd when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.\n\nI would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you're in the minority, but we still want to hear from you.\n\n(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.\n\nI am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.\n\nI'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?\n\nSANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman. I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.\n\nCLINTON: I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.\n\nSo I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Final comment.\n\nSANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit.\n\nAll over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We're going to cut Social Security to help you. We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.\n\nBut, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.\n\nIf that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Thank you both.\n\nIFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters.\n\nThe first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: \"Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?\"\n\nSenator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable.\n\nSo what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.\n\nThe reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.\n\nWe need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.\n\nWhat we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.\n\nThe statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.\n\nHis family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama's policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.\n\nCLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.\n\nAnd, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.\n\nBut, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do.\n\nBut, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.\n\nWe will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.\n\n(APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.\n\nSo, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.\n\nWe now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.\n\nBut, we can't rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Senator Sanders?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.\n\nSo when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.\n\nWOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they've been?\n\nSANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners. We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.\n\nAnd I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK?\n\nSANDERS: White people?\n\nIFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER)\n\nSo many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don't they have a reason to be resentful, Senator -- Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.\n\nAnd that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?\n\nAnd I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.\n\nI particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.\n\nSo, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Senator -- Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to -- am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.\n\nSANDERS: And here's what the economic issue is.\n\nThe wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.\n\nBut view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.\n\nYou once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They're off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.\n\nWhat have you got now? You are working at McDonald's? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.\n\nAnd that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.\n\nSuicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Thank you.\n\nSenator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits.\n\nWould you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?\n\nSANDERS: The answer is yes. We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.\n\nI believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.\n\nAnd in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.\n\nAnd let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those.\n\nBottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: I strongly support the president's executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.\n\nI am against the raids. I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.\n\nI'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.\n\nSenator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.\n\nHopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.\n\nIn terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.\n\nSo it wasn't just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.\n\nBut we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.\n\nCLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.\n\nI've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.\n\nAnd with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: I'd like... SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don't apologize for that vote.\n\nBut in terms of the children, I don't know to whom you're sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don't think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.\n\nSo we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, we've been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, \"My father\" -- she's a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, \"My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid's family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?\"\n\nStart with you, Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.\n\nSANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.\n\nAnd here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.\n\nYes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\nI have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.\n\nSANDERS: In all due respect...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal?\n\nNow, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then.\n\nI would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.\n\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been...\n\nSANDERS: That's my bill. Check it out.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen. I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I'm going to come up with the best way forward. We're going to end up in the same place. We're going to get more revenue. I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: We're going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.\n\nWOODRUFF: You have said that there's no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?\n\nCLINTON: I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions.\n\nLet's talk about our campaigns. I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.\n\nI think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.\n\nThe Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: I'm asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.\n\nSANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy.\n\nWhen extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.\n\nNow, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying...\n\nCLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I'm very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.\n\nBut, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It's not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.\n\nI would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.\n\nNow, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's. So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: The people aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWhy does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?\n\nWhy does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that's a major accomplishment.\n\nI agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.\n\nAnd I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate. But let's not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We...\n\nSANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That's my view.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, we're going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.\n\nIFILL: There's a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.\n\n(BREAK)\n\nWOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders.\n\nSenator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: \"Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?\"\n\nSANDERS: Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.\n\nI believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.\n\nIFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton -- Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.\n\nI would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore. And that's what I intend to do.\n\nSANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America's role in the world.\n\nAmericans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can't win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we?\n\nCLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9\/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.\n\nSo we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.\n\nWe have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.\n\nAnd we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.\n\nHere at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.\n\nBut the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9\/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country.\n\nBut we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It's not only offensive; it's dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.\n\nSo this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.\n\nIFILL: Senator Sanders...\n\nSANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...\n\n... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.\n\nI voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them. And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.\n\nNow I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.\n\nAnd God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.\n\nAnd in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.\n\nBut this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences.\n\nSo I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nHe voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.\n\nI do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.\n\nWhen people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.\n\nAs we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.\n\nI was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.\n\nBut judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it.\n\nBut more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.\n\nSANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.\n\nCLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.\n\nI looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I'm proud that I gave him that advice. And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly...\n\nWOODRUFF: Just a final word.\n\nSANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.\n\nSANDERS: Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger. That's for sure.\n\nCLINTON: That's fine. That's fine.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.\n\nSANDERS: It is.\n\nCLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.\n\nAnd then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Senator, let me -- let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that's Russia. On the one hand, we're aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.\n\nWOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead -- that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all -- have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS.\n\nSo my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared -- how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.\n\nSANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.\n\nAs you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable. It is a real horror.\n\nNow, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.\n\nI happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.\n\nSANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.\n\nThe agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.\n\nBut I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.\n\nThis is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.\n\nThis is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.\n\nSo let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.\n\nSo as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Let me just -- just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.\n\nI think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let's hope that it holds.\n\nSANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.\n\nAnd by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.\n\nAnd I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That's how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.\n\nI do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.\n\nYes, they've got to get out of Syria. They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.\n\nWe have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.\n\nI have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It's easier to talk to your friends. It's harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day.\n\nNearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing.\n\nIf we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.\n\nAnd it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.\n\nWith respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.\n\nAnd we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.\n\nCLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.\n\nSANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.\n\nIt seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about.\n\nSo I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well.\n\nBut I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He's a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, \"The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders -- one American and one foreign -- who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as -- why are they influential?\"\n\nSANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.\n\nAnd then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That's not the role of the government.\n\nAnd when FDR said, \"Yeah, it is,\" that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.\n\nAnd kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process. don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.\n\nIn the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.\n\nCLINTON: But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment.\n\nHe wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.\n\nAnd I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: ... who got us out of that...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.\n\nSANDERS: That is...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.\n\nAs a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.\n\nSo I have voiced criticisms. You're right. Maybe you haven't. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.\n\nThat's what I said. That is what I believe.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re-election. His first election and his re-election.\n\nBut I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.\n\nAs a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.\n\nIFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to -- you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.\n\nSANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this.\n\nThere is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.\n\nThis campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.\n\nYoung people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon. It ain't going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.\n\nSANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.\n\nBut here's the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.\n\nAnd here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You're right.\n\nBut if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you, Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: And we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall, and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. That's coming up next here on PBS stations and online at PBS.org\/NewsHour.\n\nIFILL: I'm going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS.\n\nWOODRUFF: And I'm going to be returning to Washington. I hope you'll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. That's it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you.\n\nIFILL: Good night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "text":"MR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, revolution in the Middle East and the showdown at home over red ink in Washington and in states like Wisconsin . Mounting leadership tests for President Obama as the battle lines of the 2012 campaign come into sharper view. This morning, how will the standoff in Wisconsin end? And is the fight there with the unions about ideology or shared sacrifice?\n\nGOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI): It's not just about the budget now and into the future . It's not just about jobs or workers. This is ultimately about the future of our state .\n\nMR. GREGORY: My guest, the man at the center of the storm , embattled Republican Governor Scott Walker . Also, the future of the Middle East remains in doubt as Libya 's brutal dictator cracks down on protesters.\n\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA: His actions violate international norms and every standard of common decency. This violence must stop.\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's next ? And has the administration done enough? Joining me this morning from the site of such unrest earlier this month, Cairo , Egypt , the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee , Republican John McCain . Then, our political roundtable . What rising oil costs could mean to our own economy . Can Washington avoid a government shutdown over spending? And the rhetorical start to 2012 : Leading Republicans exchanging blows and union activists mobilizing. With us, president of the AFL-CIO , Richard Trumka ; Republican governor of Mississippi and former RNC Chairman , Haley Barbour ; chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Missouri Congressman Emanuel Cleaver ; host of MSNBC 's \" The Last Word ,\" Lawrence O'Donnell ; and editorial board member and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , Kim Strassel .\n\nAnnouncer: From NBC News in Washington , MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Good morning. Protests grew in Madison , Wisconsin , Saturday after days of demonstrations there by pro- labor supporters. The standoff started two weeks ago after Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker proposed a budget -balancing bill that would severely limit the rights of most public workers to collectively bargain. The bill would also require them to pay for 12.6 percent of the total cost of their healthcare premiums, and contribute almost 6 percent of their pay toward their pension benefits. Walker 's proposal is an attempt to close the $137 million deficit in this year's state budget , a shortfall that is projected to grow to $3.6 billion in the next two years. And here with us now from Madison , the man in the middle of all this, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker . Governor, welcome to MEET THE PRESS .\n\nGOV. WALKER: Good morning. Good to be with you , David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So that context is important because there's collective bargaining , which you'd like to limit, and there are those -- the specific contributions that you asked the unions. They said they would do that, they would meet those demands. So the question that comes up again and again is, if you want to deal with the budget and the deficit, why not take yes for an answer?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, because we've seen that actions speak louder than words. For us to balance the $3.6 billion deficit we have -- but not only now, but to ensure we can continue to do that in the future so our kids don't inherit these same dire consequences -- we've got to have assurances. And over the past two weeks , even after they made those promises, we've seen local union after local union rush to their school boards , their city councils, their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care . And, in fact, in one case in Janesville , they actually were pushing through a pay increase. Actions do speak louder than words.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Governor, you could have extended the bill -- you could have extended the bill to those local government agencies. You chose not to.\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, that's just the opposite. I was a local government official for eight years. This bill precisely helps local governments , and it's effective once it passes. In fact, we're, we're facing a $3.6 billion deficit. Like nearly every other state across the country , we're going to have to cut more than a billion dollars from our schools and local governments . You know, in New York and California , where there are Democrats for governors, they're doing that. The difference here is, with this budget repair bill, we give those schools and local governments more -- almost a billion and a half dollars worth of savings. So the savings they get from our budget repair bill exceed the amount...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But...\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...that they're cut from the next state budget .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, but let, let me be clear . If the unions, who, who it seems to me have been clear in saying that they would agree to those extra contributions, if they did that, and you say you're concerned about the budget shortfall, why not accept that?\n\nGOV. WALKER: But what I -- my point is they can't because they -- the two people that suggested it are statewide union leaders. There are a thousand-plus municipalities, there's four -- more than 424 school districts , there's 72 counties. I know -- I used to be a county executive for eight years -- I know that collective bargaining has to be done in every jurisdiction. They can't guarantee that. And the actions of those local unions over the past two weeks show that. If they were serious about it, they would have offered up contracts that, that paid something for health care and something more for pensions. But they're not. The, the reality is, even beyond the five and the 12, collective bargaining does have a cost. In Wisconsin , a great example of that is, we have, in many of our school districts , a requirement through collective bargaining contracts that they have to buy their health insurance from a company that's owned by our state teacher's union , WA Trust . Because of that, it costs them up to $68 -- $68 million more than if they could just buy it from the state employee healthcare plan. Those are real costs about putting real money in the classroom instead of into these collective bargaining agreements. And, for me, at the, at the county level...\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's one -- Governor, let me just stop you.\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...I tried to avoid layoffs.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But what, what's wrong with collective bargaining ? Let's be clear . So unions organize public employees. They're able to bargain, not just about wages, but also about health benefits and pension benefits. What you're trying to do is say no, you can just collectively bargain when it comes to how much you make, but not those other benefits.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's so wrong with that, collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today. Under Barack Obama , he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for, for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has. And, in fact, most federal employees...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But I asked you a more specific question, which is what's wrong with collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, for us it's, it's about the fact that, again, as a local official, I can tell you personally time and time again because of collective bargaining when we had tough budgets in the past, when I was at the county presiding as the CO there, I tried to do modest changes of pension, I tried to do modest changes in health care . In fact, one year I literally tried to do a 35- hour work week to try and avoid massive layoffs and furloughs, and the union said, \"Forget it.\" Embodied, emboldened by the fact that they had collective bargaining agreements, they said, \"Go ahead. Literally lay off 400 or 500 people.\" And to me, laying off people in this economy is just completely unacceptable.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me, let me ask you about...\n\nGOV. WALKER: If we do not get these changes and the Senate Democrats don't come back, we're going to be forced to make up the savings in layoffs. And that, to me, is just unacceptable.\n\nMR. GREGORY: I don't mean to -- we have a satellite delay here, it sometimes gets us to bump up against each other. But I want to focus on inconsistencies in some of your argument. You do have exemptions here. You've said, \"We're going to pass this bill, but if you're a cop or a firefighter you don't have to make those extra contributions and you can still collectively bargain.\" You seem to be picking winners and losers. Cops and firefighters don't have to join this. Are they more important than a teacher who spends six hours a day with children in Wisconsin ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, this is not a value judgment about employees, but it is ultimately about preserving public safety . We saw two weeks ago, when this debate first started, teachers here in Madison walked off the job for three days. Now, that was an inconvenience for a lot of parents. I know I've got two public -- kids in public school . Anytime you have a disturbance like that, it's an inconvenience. But that, contrasted to the fact that even if there was one jurisdiction across the state where firefighters or police officers weren't on the job in full force , I can't afford to have a fire or crime committed where there's a gap in service. And it ultimately just boils down to public safety .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, but again, if you're talking about austerity, and you want to deal with this budget deficit , doesn't there have to be a sense of shared sacrifice, that everybody gets hurt?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, there is. I'm a -- well, I'm affecting my family about this, the legislature , my Cabinet -- in fact, as elected officials , we'll pay a higher dollar amount, a higher percentage because of these changes, to show that we're that serious about it. Now, the, the statewide firefighters union president has come out and said they'd take the five and the 12. I would suggest to every mayor out there that they take them up on that. But in terms of making that change, I can't afford to have a gap when it comes to public safety . I think that's the one thing universally, Republican and Democrat alike, liberal or conservative, that people know that we cannot have a gap in, and that's why we made that change in the bill.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You were the subject of a crank call , a liberal blogger who was trying to draw you into, to a conversation about all of this.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, and you had a serious conversation, not knowing who you were talking to. And you talked about Ronald Reagan ...\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...and him taking on the unions and the air traffic controllers . And you talked about putting this moment in some kind of context. This is part of what you said.\n\nGOV. WALKER: In Wisconsin 's history -- little did I know how big it would be nationally -- in Wisconsin 's history I said, \"This is our moment , this is our time to change the course of history.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"Change the course of history.\" And this is where critics say, you know, this governor is really more of an ideologue than someone who wants to solve a serious problem . You're going farther than other Republicans who have taken on pension and healthcare costs to really go active -- after collective bargaining . And by your own admission, you're saying, \"Well, there's some areas where we just can't afford that level of austerity.\" But if you're serious about austerity, doesn't it have to be a situation where everybody gets affected?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, in the end, the reason I made that comment, I do believe that this is our moment in Wisconsin 's history. It's one of those where, for year after year after year, not just the last governor, but governors before, legislatures before, have kicked the can. They've taken one-time fixes to push the budget problems off into the future . We can't do that. We're broke. Like nearly every other state across the country , we're broke. And it's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state and said, \"Here's our problem . Here's the solution,\" and acted on it. Because, if we don't, we fail to make a commitment to the future . Our children will face even more dire consequences than what we face today.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Governor, if you, if you say you're broke...\n\nGOV. WALKER: So I, I make no apology for the fact that this is an important moment in time.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, if you're really serious about the state being broke, you have a deal that you could take to get the contributions you need to solve the problem at hand. Why not separate that out from your views about collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: But, but, David , my point is repeatedly, as a former local government official, I know that collective bargaining has a cost, and when I'm cutting out more a billion dollars from aid to local governments in this next two-year budget , I need to do what no other governor's doing across the country . They're all cutting. All but a handful are cutting. The difference is where we want to be unique in Wisconsin is we have to give those local governments the tools. And it goes beyond the 5 and the 12 percent. And as I mentioned repeatedly, I don't think we can take that 5 and 12 percent to the bank...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Are you needless dividing your state ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...because unions have shown us the last two weeks that, that they're not going to do it. No. I think, in the end, the best way for us to move forward is for those 14 state senators -- the state assembly did their job, Democrats in the assembly stood up, made their argument, made their case, did what they were elected to do. The assembly passed it. It is now at a point where we want to move forward. It's real simple. Those 14 state senators need to come back and do what they were elected to do, come back here -- they don't have to vote for it, they don't have to support it, but they need to come back and do their job. And when we do, I have every belief that -- the first four, five weeks we're in office, we passed an aggressive agenda that showed that Wisconsin is open for business. Many of those same senate Democrats voted with me on those measures. We can get back to that if they just come back and do the job they were elected to do.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And if they don't -- if they don't, Governor, how does this end?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, I'm an optimist. I'm an eternal optimist. As much as I understand there's passion and that's -- you know, in America , that's great. We can have passion and be civil about it. But, in the end, I believe that those -- at least some of those state senators will come back. If we fail to pass this bill by Tuesday, we lose $165 million worth of savings. If we continue down that path, we start seeing layoffs. I know that was one of the most difficult decisions I ever had to make when I was a county official was considering layoffs. I would go to almost any ends to avoid that. My hope is at least one of those 14 state senators feels the same way.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, final question here, I want to clarify something. In the course of this prank, this crank call that you got.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: It was suggested by someone who was a liberal blogger that you might think about planting troublemakers into the crowd. And you said quote, \"We thought about that.\" Is that right? You really thought about trying to bust up physically these protests?\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, we thought , as the call continues and I've said repeatedly, we, we rejected that. But we have people all the time who contact us for and against this bill, and you can imagine people with all sorts of ideas and suggestions, and we look at everything that's out there. But the bottom line is, we rejected that because we have had a civil discourse. We've had, you know, a week ago, 70,000 people, we had more than that yesterday, and yet we haven't had problems here. We haven't had disturbances. We've just had very passionate protesters for and against this bill, and that's OK. That's a very Midwestern thing. But we're not going to allow anybody to come in from outside of this state and try and disrupt this debate . They can inform it, but we're not going to allow them to disrupt this debate and take the focus off the real issue here. And the issue is, the people in Wisconsin , particularly those 14 state senators , need to come home and have the debate here in the state Capitol .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Governor Walker , we will leave it there. Thank you very much .\n\nGOV. WALKER: Thank you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And we'll have much more on this debate coming up in our political roundtable where we will be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka . But first, to discuss the other big story this week, the unrest in the Middle East and the violence in Libya by the regime of Moammar Gadhafi . We want to bring in the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , John McCain , who has been traveling in the Middle East this week, including stops in Tunisia , Lebanon , and Jordan . And he joins us this morning from the very busy Cairo . Senator McCain , welcome.\n\nSEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ): Thank you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask you first about Libya and events that are moving very quickly, including the U.S. response. The president has made it clear that he wants Gadhafi to go. His ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , speaking after a vote in the Security Council in favor of sanctions against Libya , imposing an arms embargo, urging member countries to freeze assets of the Gadhafi family. And this is what Ambassador Rice said during that debate .\n\nDR. SUSAN RICE: When a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator, the question is how is that achieved?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with that statement, but I'd also like to point out that we could impose and could have imposed a no-fly zone. They would've stopped flying if that had been imposed. They're using air power and helicopters to continue these massacres. We should recognize a provisional government somewhere in eastern Libya , perhaps Benghazi . We should make it clear that we will provide assistance to that provisional government . And finally, we should make it absolutely clear that anyone who continues or is in engaged in these kinds of barbarous acts are going to find themselves on trial in a war crimes tribunal. We've got to really get tough.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, and by get tough, if you talk about a no-fly zone, would you stop short there? I mean, you're, you're certainly raising the specter of some kind of military intervention on the part of the U.S. and its allies to stop Gadhafi to force him to go.\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, I think that providing the so-called provisional government , and there will be one, with the equipment and material that they could use, the no-fly zone, I think would be a very strong signal. I'm not ready to use ground forces or further intervention than that. Look, Gadhafi 's days are numbered. The question is, how many? And how many people are going to be massacred before he leaves one way or the other? I think those measures that I just mentioned could hasten his demise.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me ask you about Egypt . We have an image of you earlier in the day in Tahrir Square where there are still protesters. The critical question is building -- the building blocks of a democratic government there. How is that going?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I think it's going along. We met with some of the young opposition leaders, these real heroes. I was in awe to be in their company about what needs to happen. There are still significant divisions, but I think they are headed in the right direction. I think there are questions about how soon to have an election , whether to have a presidential election before the parliamentary elections. But I believe that there's every good chance they can succeed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator McCain , you're in the region. We're watching what could be called an Arab spring, an historic movement. It's also a game-changing movement for the United States and our interests there. It's my understanding the president has ordered a complete review of Middle East strategy. I know that our defense leaders have also called for instant contingency planning . As you survey the area, how do we reassess both emergencies there and our interests there?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, first of all, I'm not sure that this winds of change are going to be confined to blowing just in the Arab world and the Maghreb . I think it's going to be all over the world , to wit what's happening in China and in other countries around the world. Second of all, the return to our fundamentals. And that is that all of us are endowed with certain inalienable rights . Respect democracy , further it. Recognize that the longer there's a dictatorship, the bigger the explosion is going to be once that people become dissatisfied enough. Recognize that, that we have to assist these countries, and it is in our national interest to do so. And the economy is a vital and the most important permanent part of any successful transition to democracy and freedom. And, frankly, we should've done more in the past. I think we should all admit that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But what about contingency planning ? Are there contingencies that may arise now that are particularly worrisome to you?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I think it's not clear where this revolution goes in, in all of these countries, and every country is very different from each other. I think we should understand that Iran can take advantage of this unsettling situations in these countries. We should be standing up for democracy in Iran . We should be backing their protesters with our moral support , which we didn't in 2009 .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask to get your reaction about something that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said this week about U.S. intervention into the Middle East and into Asia . This is what he said at West Point on Friday.\n\nMR. ROBERT GATES: In my opinion, any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa , should have his head examined, as General McArthur so delicately put it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: How do you respond to that, Senator ?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I have the highest regard for Secretary Gates . I think he's one of the finest secretaries of Defense in the history of our country and a great patriot. I think there are times, however, and I'm sure he would say this, where it does require U.S. military intervention. Afghanistan was the genesis of 9\/11, as you know. We had to stamp out the situation -- get the situation there under control so that it would not continue to be a base for attacks on the United States and our allies. But I also understand the implications of the needs of a new kind of warfare to counter this radical Islamic extremism wherever it rears its head, particularly in those continents that he referred to.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Finally, Senator McCain , I just wanted to get your reaction to something that came out of Rolling Stone magazine that I'm sure you're aware of this week. Here was a picture with you in Kabul with Lieutenant General William Caldwell , and this is the piece by Rolling\n\nStone featuring him. It says this: \" The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in psychological operations to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned. And when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.\" As you know, General Petraeus is now investigating this. What happened?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, you know, that's been tried on me in the past, David . I don't know what's happened. I do know that the -- General Caldwell is a great leader and has done a great job in leading the Afghan army . I also know that these briefers are briefed, \"You know, Senator\n\nX is interested in the following: A, B, C, D and E.\" And, and that, and that I think is perfectly legitimate. Now, if it went any further than that, I don't know. General Petraeus will make a full investigation. General Caldwell has steadfastly denied it, but I don't see how it could have affected my positions in any way. And so we'll see what happens. But I've, I'm -- put me down as skeptical.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator McCain , we will leave it there. Thank you very much and safe travels. And coming up next, as a government shutdown looms, budget battles front and center in the Capitol and in statehouses across the country . Ground zero for it all this week? Wisconsin . What is at stake there? What will it mean for the rights of workers ? And how will it all impact the 2012 race for the White House . Our political roundtable weighs in. We'll be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka ; Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour ; the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Emanuel Cleaver ; MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell ; and The Wall Street Journal 's Kim Strassel .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Coming up, what will the budget battles taking place across the country mean for the race for the White House in 2012 . Our roundtable weighs in. It's up next after this brief commercial break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back now with our political roundtable . The president of the AFL - CIO , Richard Trumka ; the Republican governor of Mississippi , former RNC chairman, Haley Barbour ; chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Missouri congressman, Democrat Emanuel Cleaver ; editorial board member and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , Kim Strassel ; and the host of MSNBC 's \" The Last Word ,\" Lawrence O'Donnell , who spent a long time on Capitol Hill in the early '90s, including several years as the chief of staff to the Senate finance committee , so he's seen some of these fights before. Welcome to all of you. Mr. Trumka , welcome to the program. You heard Governor Walker . This is an important moment for unions, and as he says it, for taxpayers. How do you respond to what he says?\n\nMR. RICHARD TRUMKA: Well, first of all, this isn't about the budget crisis . Let's look at how this -- his arguments migrated. First he said it was -- the budget crisis was caused because workers were paid too much in Wisconsin . We now have studies that show they're not overpaid, they're underpaid. In fact, people with a degree in Wisconsin get 25 percent less than their private sector things. Then he said it was about the pension. Now we find out that his pension plan , unlike a lot in the country , is almost fully funded. The assets match the liabilities. And then the employees said, or the members out there said, his workers said, \"We'll accept your cuts.\" And he said, \"No. We won't accept your accepting our cuts.\" And the most outrageous thing that he did, and he talked about this, was he's now saying to them, \"You either have to accept a loss of your rights or I'm going to lay you off.\" Now, no person should have to face the right of their loss of their job or the loss of their rights. I know Governor Barbour would never say to his employees, his people down there, \"You either have to give up your rights or you have to give up your job.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me, let me follow up on one point. A lot of people who are following this may be confused but certainly have questions about the role of public sector unions. And there does something that seem, seem to be distorted. You raise a lot of money from public employees. That goes, goes to finance campaigns to try to get somebody in office that you can do business with. And ultimately you're supporting someone, in some cases, that you're ultimately negotiating with. They also know that political employees, rather public employees are politically active because they're organized by the unions. And so they make concessions on things like pensions, on health care , knowing that the promises don't come due to well down the road. Isn't this the cycle that we've gotten into that public unions have to take some responsibility for?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Well, public employees do take responsibility for it. And those governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can actually work out problems . They -- we can solve them. But that's not what Governor Walker is doing. He's saying, \"I won't talk to you. I'll talk to all my, my big contributors.\" He talked to the Koch brothers, he thought . \"But I won't talk to employees.\" Look, the five countries -- or the five states in this country that prohibit collective bargaining by state employees have a collective debt right now of $220 billion. This isn't about employees. This is about the economy .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So...\n\nMR. TRUMKA: What we need to do is create jobs, and that's what we should be doing.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. And we'll get to that.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Working together.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, Governor Barbour , this is the question that I posed at the beginning of the program. Is this, is this an ideologue? Is this just about ideology? Is it about union busting ? Or is it about really getting serious about shared sacrifice?\n\nGOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS): Well, it's about budgets. It is about the fact that Wisconsin , like many states , is broke. And the idea is, \"OK, let's make a very narrow agreement over wages and, and -- for one year is going to solve the problem .\" Governor Walker understands, as every governor understands, it is not enough just to kick the can down the road to next year because these problems snowball. They cascade. And that's why it's critical to get ahold of this. For most states the, well, the pay...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But he -- but his argument is that the unions are so unreasonable, they won't ultimately make concessions. They've made the concession.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: For a year.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's the whole problem . They've got to change the system. About half the states in the country don't allow or limited -- limit collective bargaining . The federal government doesn't have collective bargaining for wages, for health benefits . I mean, this -- people act like this is some right, you know, that these are collective bargaining rights. There's no right to this under the Constitution .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Lawrence O'Donnell , how do you read this?\n\nMR. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL: Well, you know, one of the things I was struck by in your interview with the governor is, just to go back to a point, is that he said that he rejected , rejected the idea of sending in troublemakers to the demonstrations. That means the idea was discussed. That means someone in the governor's office said, \"How about we send some people in there to cause physical trouble in these demonstrations?\" And this governor thought about it, discussed it, rejected it. OK, he rejected it. But to say he rejected it and think, \"Well, that's the end of it, that's a noncontroversial moment ,\" it's quite shocking to think that there was a governor thinking about that.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, Larry , you added the word physical. Nobody ever -- you could talk about should you send people out there to talk to the employees?\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: OK, let's, let's just -- OK, I'll, I'll retract that. Let's just say troublemakers. This -- it's, it's shocking to think the governor, among the things they were discussing was, \"Should we send in troublemakers?\" How long did you -- would you have to discuss that?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let met bring in Congressman Cleaver . I mean, you were on this program last month after the shooting of Gabby Giffords . We talked about tone. We talked about inappropriate public discourse . And I want to show you some of the placards that have been used by demonstrators, pro- union supporters out there. They have cast the governor -- this one here, \"One dictator to go, one dictator down,\" talking about Hosni Mubarak . He has been compared to Hitler . We spent time on this program talking about the nonsense about Obama being a Muslim or not being born in America and asking Republicans if they reject that. Should that kind of discourse be rejected in this fight?\n\nREP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO): Absolutely. It's inappropriate. It should be condemned, not only by people close to the governor, but by those of us who are observers. I think that's something that we've got to squash in, in this country . We've come to a, a, a, a point in this government discussion where, you know, one side says, \"Anything goes to get my point across.\" And I , I think it would be certainly something that I would condemn. But, but, but it goes even further than that. We're not even involved in trying to solve the problems . One side proposes, the other side opposes. That's why we're not making progress. The -- you know, the, the governor is saying here, you know, you know, \"You come back, let's, let's prevent me laying off employees.\" If you -- when, when the lion and the lamb lie down, if you look closely, when the lion gets up the lamb is missing. When the governor says, \"Come back home,\" he's not saying, \"Let's negotiate.\" He's saying, \"Come back home so I can do what I want to do to the unions.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Kim Strassel , I want, I want to bring you in on this. And the president said this was an assault on unions.\n\nMS. KIM STRASSEL: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: He's then gone quiet. Back in 2007 on the campaign trail, this is what he said, if this were to ever come to pass.\n\nPRES. OBAMA: And understand this. If American workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain when I'm in the White House , I'll put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself, I'll walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States of America. Because workers deserve to know that somebody's standing in their corner.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So here he said it was an assault on unions. In the past he said, \"I'll be out there walking with you.\" He's now gone silent. Meantime, he's trying to move to the center politically and try to create jobs. He's put himself in a difficult political situation here.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well, as the governor says, he needs to have a pair of shoes on picketing around Washington , D.C. , because federal workers are not allowed any of these collectively bargaining rights that he's talking about there. Look, one of the problems here is that I think the problem for Democrats and unions in this is that it's not necessarily a winning issue here. What's going on in the states is a microcosm of the federal debate , and that is about fiscal responsibility right now. What these governors are saying -- and it's Chris Christie in New Jersey , it's Scott Walker in Wisconsin , it's John Kasich in Ohio ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But they're not going as far on collective bargaining , not in New Jersey , not in Indiana .\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Right. But we're talking about the bigger issue about budgets...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: ...and how you deal with budgets. You even have Democrats like Andrew Cuomo in New York saying, \"When we look at these budgets, huge ballooning areas of these budgets are due to public sector union benefits, and we cannot touch them because of collective bargaining , because of these things. We need the flexibilities and tools to fix this.\" And so that's a, that's an argument that resonates with Americans . People are talking about trying to cast this as the middle -- an assault on the middle class . It was middle -class taxpayers who elected these guys.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, Richard Trumka ...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: They campaigned on it. They elected them, they put them in office to do this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...is, is, is President Obama doing enough? Is he satisfying you?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Look, it's important for the president -- for middle class voters to know that the president is on their side.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: But this isn't about President Obama .\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, but I'm asking you whether he's doing enough.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: This is about a governor -- wait.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You heard what he said in 2007 .\n\nMR. TRUMKA: This is about a governor...\n\nMR. GREGORY: He'd be out there with you. He's not out there with you.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: David , this is about a governor who's taken on nurses and EMTs ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mr. Trumka , but answer the question. I asked a very specific question. The president, in 2007 as a candidate, said, \"If this ever happened, I'd be with you.\" Do you think he's with you?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I think, I think he's doing it the right way. He's not taking on workers like Scott Walker is...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: ...and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle class way of life. He stands for that. He's doing that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Could he be doing more?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: He could -- everybody could be doing more.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, that's -- but in this particular case. I mean, Lawrence , I want to go back to the politics here. It is very difficult for a president who wants to move to the center to, before the cannon -- you know, after it fired initially he said it's an assault on unions, then he's gone quiet. And now he's, he's, he's got unhappiness on the left and on the right, and he just wants to be more of a centrist guy right now.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: It would be interesting to see what his choice would be if he was in a second term.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: This is someone who won Wisconsin . He has to win Wisconsin again. There is chaos there right now. Politically, he doesn't know how this is going to play three months from now. If a large majority or significant majority of Wisconsin likes the outcome, whatever it is, a few months from now, that's where the president wants to be going into his re- election there.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, you know, talking about...\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: So that's why he's staying out of it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, and I want to talk about the politics some more. Howard Fineman , in The Huffington Post , had an analysis about this and how, in many ways, this is about the GOP 's attempts to win more governor seats around the country . He talks about it, \"The Real Political Math in Wisconsin . What happened?\" Why did Republicans only get 12 this last go-round? \"Well, according to GOP strategists and Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi who chaired the [ RGA ] in 2010 the power and money of public-employee unions was the reason. ... \" The GOP strategic aim is simple enough. If they can abolish union collective-bargaining rights, they can undermine the automatic payment of dues to the public-employee union treasuries. Shrinking those treasuries and reducing the union structure and membership will make it harder for Democrats ... to communicate directly with workers.\"\n\nMR. TRUMKA: There it is.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Now, that's what Howard said.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right, that's....\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's what Howard said.\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, no, but...\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's what Howard said.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Do you disagree with him?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Look, this is about -- this is a state issue in a state where they've got serious budget problems because payroll pensions are such a huge part of the budget you got to deal with it , and you can't deal with it for one year. I have some...\n\nMR. GREGORY: This is a national movement , I thought . I thought it was a national movement . OK.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Let's talk about -- you asked about the president.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: The president is one of the greatest politicians in the history of the United States , and he -- and he's quiet because he understands that most Americans know this has to be done.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Congressman, where -- hold on, let me get Congressman...\n\nREP. CLEAVER: Let's sue him for breach of promise and move on. I mean, let's -- you know, the reality is that the, the, the president needs to be in Washington dealing with a plethora of issues around the world, not the least of which is Libya . But I want to go back to something that, that you said actually twice, Governor, and, and that is you said, you know, this is -- would be a one-year agreement. The governor was just elected. He'll still be governor in a year. And, you know, the, the, the agreements that we have were not made by Gadhafi . They were made by people who sat down in a room and worked out a, worked out an agreement. And I think labor unions are saying, and, and public sector employees are saying, \"OK, you know, maybe things have gotten out of balance. We'll, we'll, we'll reduce some things.\" The governor is saying, \"I don't care.\" You know, \"I want to crush the union .\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to, I want to get to a break. Richard Trumka , I want to ask you one thing, again, about the tone of the debate . You're one of the leading labor voices in the country . Do you condemn the hyperbole, the overstatements, comparisons to Hitler and dictators? Do you think that's wrong on the part of pro- union supporters?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: We want to -- I -- look, we ought to -- pro, anti- union , it doesn't matter.\n\nMR. GREGORY: It's inappropriate.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: We should be sitting down trying to create jobs. When -- and look, if you think that the argument that you're doing in Wisconsin is winning, as you said, Kim , the polls show that every -- Wisconsin , vast majority of the people think this governor has overreached. His popularity has gone down. They're saying to him, \"Sit down and negotiate. Don't do what you've been doing.\" So he's losing. If that's the argument you're going to do this year or next year, it's a loser for, for anybody who advocates it.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: And I don't know why you fear democracy so much. You're saying that this is a temporary agreement. It's a, it's a result of democracy in Wisconsin . Republicans won Wisconsin , and, and the, and Republicans ran on this. And now they're doing this. If the idea remains popular, and if it has democratic support in Wisconsin , meaning support of the democracy of Wisconsin , why would you worry about leaving this agreement out there so that it -- and allowing collective bargaining so that the -- Wisconsin can democratically express itself in the future as being in favor or opposed to more or less government spending on workers?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, Larry , it, it is precisely because I do believe in democracy . We had an election in 2010 , and Wisconsin voted for a Republican governor, a Republican senator, two Republican Houses of the legislature , and they have determined this is the best way to go forward to get the budget of that state , in effect, which they were elected to do. Look at Indiana . In Indiana this was done six years ago by the governor. It has been very popular. Nobody put Mitch Daniels ' picture with a, with a crosshair over his face like they're doing in Wisconsin . You know, if Sarah Palin , did that, you know...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well...\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: ...it would be the world coming to an end.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, quick -- Kim , quick point, and then I want to get to a break.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well, actually, in fairness, I mean, Governor Daniels was -- did get some blow-back when he did this six years ago.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: And his approval ratings did go down, but the problem -- the question is, what happens in the end? People want to see balanced budgets . And what's interesting is, Governor Daniels is one of the few states , because he ended up with that flexibility in his budget to negotiate, he's had -- been in the black for the past five or six years, even when other states have not.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me get a break in here. I want to talk a little bit about the budget woes here in Washington , as well as what's going on in the Middle East , right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back with our roundtable . Congressman Cleaver , I want to talk about the president's budget and the spending showdown here in Washington . We're actually not talking a great deal about the budget yet because there's this prospect of a government shutdown because Republicans , Democrats can't seem eye to -- see eye to eye on spending for just the rest of this fiscal year. This is a statement that you put out about the president's budget . And I 'll put it up on the screen. \"Rebuilding our economy ,\" you wrote, \"on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans is something I simply cannot accept. ... \"I understand that now is the time for us as a nation to sacrifice in order to protect our children from a certain amount of debt; however, I'm struggling to understand how this budget helps us best to achieve this critical goal. Cutting funding to programs that assist hardworking Americans , help families heat their homes, and expand access to graduate-level education seems to conflict with the notion of winning the future . We cannot win the future by leaving our most vulnerable behind.\" Do we have the balance wrong as we approach spending this year and look ahead to the president's budget ?\n\nREP. CLEAVER: Absolutely. Let me, let me preface my comment on that by, by just saying, you know, disagreement does not equal disassociation or disaffection. And disagreement among friends is the insignia of a healthy relationship. We've, we've got to disagree with the president when we think that he's moving in a direction that's disturbing. But, at the same time, I do think that real cuts needs to be made. But, but let's keep in, in mind, you know, I think we're dangerously cutting. Ben Bernanke has warned Congress in, in a hearing that cavernous cuts could hurt what is a rickety recovery. And Goldman Sachs , in, in, in an analysis released last week, said that even if the proposed cuts are reduced to 25 billion for the first year and 50 billion for next year that it would still create a, a 1 percent cut in economic growth of the GDP .\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, but, Lawrence , there is a stop-gap measure that looks like it'll head off a shutdown. But then the president's still going to have to engage on the fact that Republicans , Democrats are far apart on these huge cuts Republicans want for this year.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: They are. It looks like they're going to avoid this Friday's possible shutdown and, and have a two week extension. They seem to have agreed on that by John Boehner basically taking the cuts the president has identified in the future and saying, \"Let's start doing them now.\" That, that's the cut package that they will include in their ongoing resolution. But the problem with this dialogue is, it all begins after our failure on recognizing what the top tax rate burdens should really be. And, and keeping them down has created this much more serious deficit situation going forward. We've been ignoring for years the reality of what has happened in the super rich level of income in this country . We should have several higher top tax brackets . It shouldn't stop at a couple of hundred thousand dollars . We have incomes, we have short-stops making $15 million who are paying the same tax rate as, you know, two UCLA married professors. This is outrageous. We have people on Wall Street in deals making $300 million in a day and they pay that same top tax rate as people making a couple of hundred thousand dollars . And so we're ignoring this massive revenue possibility in the high end of incomes in this country .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And as this debate goes on, Kim , you can respond to that, but I also want to talk about another threat to the economy that is coming from the events that we're talking about in the Middle East . I thought this cartoon by Jim Margulies captured it, a syndicated cartoonist. \"The price of liberty,\" he says in the cartoon, \"is $5.00 a gallon.\" And we're talking about Libya , only 2 percent of the oil market, but very important in Europe.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And it's the speculation that causes folks to pay more for gas here. How does this imperil this economy ?\n\nMS. STRASSEL: No, that, that is the real problem , is speculation, at the moment . As you said, Libya is 3 percent of the oil market and you've already had the Saudis come out and say we can replace the oil that's not coming out of Libya . What you're seeing here is, is traders worried that this Arab revolt is going to spread to places like Saudi and they are building in some of that worry into the price . That's why you've seen the spike. This acts as a tax on the economy . You know, every time we -- I think we import 7.5 -- or we use 7.5 billion barrels of oil a year, every time $10 a barrel price hike, that's a huge new tax on the economy . Now, some of this, by the way, I should point out, isn't just Libya and speculation. We're also seeing in here part of Ben Bernanke 's quantitative easing and inflation working its way into oil prices as well.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: We're also...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: We're also seeing, David , the administration's energy policy , which is driving down American oil production . I mean, the shutting down of the Gulf of Mexico , taking lands in Alaska off, the, the issues that they are raising. America 's going to produce about 13 percent more domestic petroleum this year. Now, how is that in our interest at a time like this or at any other time?\n\nMR. GREGORY: You, you talk about that in terms of energy policy as someone who may run for president. And we'll talk more about politics after the break. As you look at the Middle East , what concerns you about U.S. posture toward that region?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, look, I'm one of these guys who believes, as Senator Vandenberg used to say, that in politics, it should stop at the water's edge when it comes to foreign policy . I'm not going to be critical of the administration, but I do think on their domestic energy policy , it is greatly compounding this problem . We're blowing past $3 a gallon, on our way to $4 a gallon, maybe Jim Margulies is right. Four dollar gasoline brought my state and a lot of places to their knees in 2008 before there ever was a meltdown on Wall Street .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me, let me get another break in here. We'll come back, talk politics for 2012 and what Wisconsin means for that and a couple of other topics, when we come back with our roundtable right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back with our final moments with our roundtable . Everything has political implications. Let's talk about the politics. The news this week for 2012 , Senator Thune has decided that he will not run for president, John Thune , from South Dakota . And you look at the Gallup Poll and here's the list, this crowded field. Huckabee and Romney look to be at the top. And there's Governor Barbour at 3 percent. And, Governor, as you look at this, and this -- the field continues to be unsettled, how will you make the calculation about whether you'll run.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: I didn't know my family was that big, 3 percent. It's a, it's a very critical decision . It's a family decision in many ways. In fact, in most ways. But I'm not going to make a decision until April. I'm going to finish my legislature , get my job done, get my budget passed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But how do you decide -- but how to make that calculation based on what you're seeing?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Because there seems to be a lot of late entries here.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Whether or not anybody else runs is irrelevant to my decision. I'm going to make the decision based on things that I think. And I don't want to take everybody else 's time going through all the things that I would have to think...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: ...that I am thinking about.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Richard Trumka , how do you assess that Republican field right now, who you'll be organizing against?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Well, they'll be a lot of them, probably.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: But...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Is there a front-runner?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I, we'll...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you, who's most formidable in your mind?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I don't know. I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go there on either side, the Democrats or Republicans . That's a debate that needs to take place. But, you know, Governor Walker what he's done and people like him, governors like him, they've energized the working class voters. And that momentum that we've picked up, the demonstrations that you're seeing in Madison isn't just in Madison . They're around the country . And that momentum is going to continue on. And, Haley , I hope you don't stake your whole campaign on taking away the right of workers to be able to earn a middle class income, because I don't think that's a winner for you at this time.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, I want to stake my campaign on the right of taxpayers to be able to pay so that the state employees can keep their jobs and don't have to be laid off.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let, let, let me ask you...\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Those state , those state , those state workers are taxpayers.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me ask about, about, about health care , Lawrence O'Donnell . As Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , who has taken on Mitt Romney , this is what he said in the Associated , Associated Press , as they covered it. \" Huckabee said Wednesday that potential White House rival Romney should offer an apologize for healthcare overhaul that he oversaw as Massachusetts governor .\" Quoting him, \"I think it's not a killer for him, but he has to say either 'I love it,' 'I hate it,' or, 'Hey, I tried it, it didn't work and that's why I should say to you let's not do it nationally.'\" He goes on, \"He's got to figure out how he wants to deal with it . It's the 800-pound elephant in the room for him.\" Now, Romney has stood by it, but said it's something that the states should work out.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: Well, Huckabee is right in identifying this is what's wrong with the Romney candidacy. And, in fact, you can go down through the list and do that with pretty much every one of the possible Republican candidates, with the exception of Tim Pawlenty , who I think is the one who is going to start moving ahead because he has no serious negative. You have thoughtful Republicans starting to support him. The ideal candidate is a Midwesterner , and that usually is true for both parties because that's where the battleground states are. With Thune dropping out, Pawlenty becomes more important in the field. But Romney has the same- -this is identical, virtually identical politically to the problem Hillary Clinton had going into that primary field , where she had to disown or own the vote in support of the Iraq war . This is much more serious. The, the, what, what Romney did on health care is much more difficult thing to overcome in the primaries. I don't think he can.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: I think that's not, not alone. I actually, that's not the only issue. And I actually agree with Richard here that what is happening in Wisconsin is going to have very big implications for the, the primaries on both sides, and in particular in this case, because the other 800-pound gorilla in the room, besides health care , is fiscal responsibility .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: You see the president entirely focused on it at the moment . And this is going to play into Republican governors...\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, Congressman...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: ...in particular who are running and their record in the states .\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...are, are Republicans running circles around Democrats and the president on the issue of fiscal responsibility , from the states to cutting in Washington ? Is that how you view it?\n\nREP. CLEAVER: No, absolutely not. The -- what, what the Republicans are mistakenly doing is pushing cuts that will hurt the very people who voted for them. And when people realize what is happening to them and their families, there will be, I think, a great deal of buyers regret, and we'll look up and see that President Obama is surging again. To, to beat somebody, you got to run somebody. This is the only person that I'm endorsing to run against Barack Obama at the moment .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah. Really? You'd endorse Governor Barbour .\n\nREP. CLEAVER: To run against Barack Obama.\n\nMR. GREGORY: To run against him, OK.\n\nREP. CLEAVER: You know, David ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're going to, we're going to have to leave it there. We're out of time. Thanks to all of you. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss an endorsement there. Before we go, a quick programming note. You can watch the rebroadcast of today's program this afternoon on MSNBC at 2 PM Eastern, followed by a re-airing of Chris Matthew 's special\n\n\"President of the World: The Bill Clinton Phenomenon.\" That's at 3 PM Eastern time .

    "text":"On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation\u2019s 40th president.\n\n\"You\u2019re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?\" Hannity asked.\n\nPerry replied that he\u2019d had a conversation with Reagan\u2019s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. \"I told Michael Reagan the other day \u2026 \u2018You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,\u2019 but I said, \u2018I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.\u2019 \"\n\nPerry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that \"Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.\"\n\nHistorian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan\u2019s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, \"was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.\"\n\nYager said that he hadn\u2019t seen copies of Reagan\u2019s voter registration cards but that \"virtually all the sources that refer to\" Reagan\u2019s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan \"has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times\" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.\n\nLater, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan\u2019s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 \u2014 at ages 41 and 45, respectively \u2014 and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 \"while remaining a Democrat.\"\n\nPerry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.\n\nThe library\u2019s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon\u2019s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. \"When he said, \u2018Well, no, I haven\u2019t yet, but I intend to,\u2019 down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, \u2018I\u2019m a registrar,\u2019 and placed a registration card in front of him,\" the site says. \"In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.\"\n\nIn her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: \"I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''\n\nOther studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager\u2019s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan \"was an active Democrat\" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, \"and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.\"\n\nIn 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he \"didn\u2019t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans\" and would re-register as a Republican. \"He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,\" Cannon writes.\n\nSo, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.\n\nHow old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at Perry\u2019s political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 \u2014 a race that Perry won in an upset.\n\nThe biography on Perry\u2019s presidential campaign website agrees with that account.\n\nA July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. \"Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,\" the story says. \"He was one of a handful of freshman \u2018pit bulls,\u2019 so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.\"\n\nThe Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. \"I intend to vote the same convictions,\" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. \"The only difference is there will be an \u2018R\u2019 beside my name.\"\n\nOn the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old.\n\nWe rate his statement as True.",

    "text":"MR. OBAMA: I said during the campaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their -- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon -- that all of those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace.\n\nWhat I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction.\n\nThere's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nAnd it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of mutual respect and progress.\n\nAnd I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of the international community, with those rights come responsibilities.\n\nOkay.\n\nMR. OBAMA: Chip Reid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nYou have often said that bipartisanship is extraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now when we ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votes in the House, three in the Senate -- they say, well, it's not the number of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will be created.",

I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\n\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\n\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: How are you, Donald?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Good luck to you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\n\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\n\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\n\nCLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\n\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\n\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\n\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\n\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\n\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\n\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\n\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\n\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\n\nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\n\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\n\nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\n\nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\n\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\n\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\n\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\n\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\n\nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\n\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\n\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.\n\nHOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\n\nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse.\n\nTRUMP: That's called business, by the way.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\n\nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\n\nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\n\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\n\nTRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: I think science is real.\n\nTRUMP: I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\n\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.\n\nNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\n\nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\n\nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.\n\nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.\n\nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually...\n\nTRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.\n\nCLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...\n\nTRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...\n\nTRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\n\nCLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.\n\nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\n\nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly...\n\nTRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...\n\nTRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.\n\nCLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nCLINTON: And I have done a lot...\n\nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.\n\nTRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\n\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\n\nCLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...\n\nTRUMP: Not.\n\nCLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...\n\nTRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: ... before you even announced.\n\nTRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: Look, there are differences...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: There are...\n\nTRUMP: Because he's pushing it.\n\nCLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\n\nTRUMP: But you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...\n\nTRUMP: That's about all you've...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Folks, we're going to...\n\nCLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.\n\nHOLT: We're going to move to...\n\nCLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\n\nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.\n\nTRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.\n\nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\n\nWhen I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\n\nI'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.\n\nHOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...\n\nCLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand.\n\nHOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.\n\nCLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...\n\nTRUMP: Facts.\n\nCLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...\n\nTRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.\n\nCLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.\n\nHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...\n\nTRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.\n\nHOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...\n\nTRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...\n\nTRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.\n\nHOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...\n\nCLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.\n\nHOLT: ... achieving prosperity...\n\nTRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.\n\nCLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.\n\nTRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\n\nCLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.\n\nHOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\n\nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.\n\nI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.\n\nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.\n\nSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\n\nInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\n\nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\n\nTRUMP: Why not?\n\nCLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...\n\nTRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\n\nHOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.\n\nTRUMP: Then you didn't read it.\n\nCLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...\n\nTRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...\n\nTRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...\n\nTRUMP: Lester, how much?\n\nCLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\n\nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\n\nCLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...\n\nTRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\n\nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\n\nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\n\nTRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.\n\nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\n\nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\n\nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\n\nHOLT: The IRS says an audit...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nHOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.\n\nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.\n\nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, \"Don't do it.\" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\n\nHOLT: So it's negotiable?\n\nTRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...\n\nHOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\n\nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.\n\nCLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\n\nTRUMP: That makes me smart.\n\nCLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.\n\nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.\n\nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\n\nHOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?\n\nCLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure.\n\nCLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.\n\nAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.\n\nThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.\n\nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.\n\nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.\n\nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\n\nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.\n\nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.\n\nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\n\nAnd it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.\n\nHOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\n\nCLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the other thing I think is important...\n\nTRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.\n\nCLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\n\nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\n\nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...\n\nTRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...\n\nCLINTON: Well, to...\n\nTRUMP: Which our country should do, too.\n\nCLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\n\nI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\n\nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\n\nHOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...\n\nCLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.\n\nTRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.\n\nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\n\nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.\n\nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\n\nBut we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.\n\nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.\n\nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.\n\nHOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.\n\nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\n\nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\n\nCLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\n\nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\n\nCLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\n\nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\n\nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.\n\nHOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.\n\nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.\n\nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\n\nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.\n\nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.\n\nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\n\nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\n\nWe have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\n\nHOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\n\nHOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.\n\nTRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\n\nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\n\nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.\n\nBut when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\n\nTRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.\n\nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton...\n\nTRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Ugh.\n\nCLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\n\nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.\n\nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\n\nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\n\nWe need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.\n\nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\n\nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\n\nCLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\n\nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\n\nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\n\nCLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.\n\nHOLT: Please.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.\n\nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\n\nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.\n\nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\n\nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\n\nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n\nCLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.\n\nCLINTON: No, I'm not.\n\nTRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.\n\nCLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\n\nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\n\nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\n\nHOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.\n\nHOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I'd just like to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\n\nTRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\n\nThe African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...\n\nTRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I...\n\nCLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?\n\nTRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\n\nTRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.\n\nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.\n\nHOLT: That was...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\n\nHOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nHOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?\n\nTRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.\n\nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.\n\nHOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\n\nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.\n\nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\n\nBut it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\n\nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\n\nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\n\nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.\n\nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.\n\nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\n\nTRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money.\n\nBut, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.\n\nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\n\nHOLT: Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\n\nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\n\nAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.\n\nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes have expired.\n\nCLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nTRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it.\n\nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\n\nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.\n\nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\n\nTRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC.\n\nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.\n\nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\n\nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.\n\nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\n\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\n\nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\n\nWe're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\n\nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\n\nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\n\nHOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.\n\nSo she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.\n\nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\n\nCLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\n\nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\n\nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?\n\nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\n\nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\n\nWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\n\nThey're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond.\n\nTRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.\n\nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.\n\nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.\n\nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\n\nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.\n\nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.\n\nAnd they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\n\nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...\n\nCLINTON: Lester, we've covered...\n\nTRUMP: No, wait a minute.\n\nCLINTON: We've covered this ground.\n\nTRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...\n\nTRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.\n\nHOLT: In 2002...\n\nTRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\n\nHOLT: My question is, since you supported it...\n\nTRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear...\n\nHOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...\n\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.\n\nHOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...\n\nTRUMP: The record does not show that.\n\nHOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any...\n\nTRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment better than...\n\nTRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.\n\nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.\n\nHOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...\n\nTRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nTRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Whew, OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9\/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\n\nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\n\nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\n\nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.\n\nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.\n\nTRUMP: That would not start a war.\n\nCLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...\n\nTRUMP: No, they were taunting us.\n\nCLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.\n\nTRUMP: It's lies.\n\nCLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\n\nTRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...\n\nCLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.\n\nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...\n\nHOLT: We need to move on.\n\nTRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.\n\nHOLT: Our last...\n\nTRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.\n\nHOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.\n\nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\n\nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\n\nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.\n\nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\n\nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.\n\nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is expired.\n\nTRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.\n\nHOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\n\nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\n\nIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\n\nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.\n\nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.\n\nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is...\n\nCLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.\n\nHOLT: ... is expired.\n\nTRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...\n\nHOLT: We have just...\n\nTRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need.\n\nHOLT: We have just a few final questions...\n\nTRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?\n\nTRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\n\nHOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has the presidential look.\"\n\nTRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?\n\nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.\n\nHOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.\n\nHOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.\n\nCLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...\n\nTRUMP: I never said that.\n\nCLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\n\nTRUMP: I didn't say that.\n\nCLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\" Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.\n\nTRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...\n\nTRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\n\nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...\n\nHOLT: Please very quickly.\n\nTRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations.\n\nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.\n\nBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...\n\nHOLT: We have to move on to the final question.\n\nTRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\n\nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.\n\nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.\n\nHOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?\n\nTRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.\n\nThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.\n\nA reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.

    "text":"Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says President Obama has not been aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have ravaged Iraq and Syria\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says President Obama has not been aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have ravaged Iraq and Syria\n\nThe territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.\n\n\"We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,\" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.\"\n\nHe said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission.\n\nBut California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, Schiff said, \"We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.\n\n\"Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,\" he said.\n\nHe warned that sending in a lot of American troops could \"aggravate\" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.\n\nMcCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.\n\n\"George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Schiff said there is an \"ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS.\" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.\n\n\"I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,\" he said.",

    "text":"More information about the United Kingdom is available on the United Kingdom Page and from other Department of State publications and other sources listed at the end of this fact sheet.\n\nU.S.-UNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS\n\nThe United States has no closer Ally than the United Kingdom. Following the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the United Kingdom officially recognized American independence, and in 1785 our two countries established diplomatic relations. Other than a brief break in relations during the War of 1812, the United States and the United Kingdom have remained durable partners and Allies. Our partnership is a foundation of our mutual prosperity and security.\n\nThe strong relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom reflects our common democratic ideals and values, which are reinforced through cooperation on political, security, and economic issues. Along with other European allies, the United States and the United Kingdom work closely together to combat terrorism, stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and ensure regional security. The United States and the United Kingdom coordinate closely to respond to dangerous and destabilizing actions by Moscow that threaten our security and erode democratic freedoms and institutions including the Kremlin\u2019s war against Ukraine, election interference, cyberattacks, use of chemical weapons, the use of corrupt proxies, and human rights violations. In September 2021 the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom signed the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) security partnership agreement, further solidifying security cooperation between allies.\n\nThe United States supports the peace process and devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland and encourages the implementation of the U.S.-brokered 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom preserve and strengthen the historic bonds between our two nations through educational, cultural, and professional exchange and development opportunities. The UK is a top study abroad destination for U.S. students, and in the 2020\/21 academic year, more than 8,028 students from the UK studied in the United States. The Fulbright Program in the United Kingdom is one of the oldest and largest in the world. Since 1948, more than 27,000 scholars, students, and teachers have benefited from Fulbright exchanges between the United States and the United Kingdom. Additionally, close to 17,500 UK citizens come to the United States each year on privately funded exchange programs.\n\nU.S. Assistance to the United Kingdom\n\nThe International Fund for Ireland (IFI), established by the British and Irish governments in 1986, provides funding for projects to sustain the peace process and to generate cross-community engagement and economic opportunity in Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) and the border counties of Ireland. The U.S. government has contributed more than $549 million to the IFI since its establishment.\n\nBilateral Economic Relations\n\nMutual trade and investment are at the heart of our prosperity, and our commitment to free market values enables our economies to thrive. Following the United Kingdom\u2019s 2020 departure from the European Union, the United States continues to be a strong partner to the United Kingdom and looks forward to advancing mutual international trade priorities rooted in our shared values, while promoting innovation and inclusive economic growth for workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom are the world\u2019s first and fifth largest economies in the world by GDP.

    "text":"Rose Garden\n\n5:35 P.M. EDT\n\nMR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.\n\nIn our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.\n\nWhat happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.\n\nAnd that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.\n\nExpanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with \u201cA\u201d ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It\u2018s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n\nWe'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.\n\nWe take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.\n\nOn behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.\n\nAnd I would like to thank Connecticut\u2019s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They\u2019ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.\n\nWe will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.\n\nWe leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.\n\nThank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who\u2019s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers \u2013- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.\n\nFamilies that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders \u2013- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We\u2019re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.\n\nAnd a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it\u2019s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.\n\nA majority of senators voted \u201cyes\u201d to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m going to speak plainly and honestly about what\u2019s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -\u2013 both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with \u201cA\u201d grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.\n\nAs they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.\n\nTheir legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she\u2019s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.\n\nIn fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn\u2019t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That\u2019s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.\n\nBut instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of \u201cbig brother\u201d gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they\u2019re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.\n\nBut the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn\u2019t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn\u2019t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.\n\nAnd obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn\u2019t prevent all future massacres. And that\u2019s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.\n\nAnd this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.\n\nI've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn\u2019t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?\n\nI've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. \"A prop,\" somebody called them. \u201cEmotional blackmail,\u201d some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don\u2019t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?\n\nSo all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.\n\nBut this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don\u2019t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We\u2019re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We\u2019re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We\u2019re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.\n\nBut we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.\n\nTo all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don\u2019t act this time, you will remember come election time.\n\nTo the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn\u2019t represent your views on this one.\n\nThe point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They\u2019ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n\nSo to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you\u2019ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.\n\nAnd that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they\u2019ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.\n\nAnd I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We\u2019re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.\n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming that the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who\u2019ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I\u2019m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I\u2019m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.\n\nI believe we\u2019re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND 5:55 P.M. EDT",

    "text":"JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the analysis of Shields and Gerson. That's syndicated columnist Mark Shields and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.\n\nDavid Brooks is off tonight.\n\nGentlemen, it's good to have you with us.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Good to be with you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, the fiscal cliff, it's still with us. It's still out there. The president made a last-minute statement late this afternoon. Where does everything stand?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Nobody knows, Judy.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION The very best from our political pundits, NewsHour regulars Mark Shields and David Brooks.\n\nWhat happened last night in the Republican Caucus is precedent-shattering. I mean, it really is, that John Boehner could not get a majority of his own caucus to support what had become the Republican position, endorsed not simply by him, but by Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy and Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nAnd it's a real problem. I think it puts at risk Boehner's own leadership and his ability to deliver Republicans. It weakens the bargaining position for Republicans in the final negotiations. But I don't know how much closer we are, because I think it strengthens the liberals in the Democratic Caucus, which is going to make it tougher for the Republicans to accept it, because a weakened Republican means a strengthened, emboldened Democratic liberal group.\n\nAnd I just think that there's too many moving parts at this point to say, this is what is going to happen.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Do you -- what do you -- can it get done, Michael? I mean, it's. . .\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Well, I generally agree with Mark.\n\nAnd today was supposed to be the end of the world. I think it feels like it for Boehner. This is a case where he ended up with 40 to 50 members of his caucus that wouldn't support anything on this.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: And they were to the right of Grover Norquist. Norquist was open to the Plan B.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Because he had endorsed Plan B.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Right, exactly. So, they want to go off the cliff flags flying. It marginalized Boehner and the Republicans in future negotiations, and raised a question of whether anyone can get a governing majority in the House of Representatives when it comes to the budget.\n\nThose are really serious matters. Now, it does go to the Senate, where Harry Reid and McConnell can try to come to some, you know, functional surrender for Republicans on rates, and kick the can on a lot of other issues, and see if that can pass in the next 10 days.\n\nBut that still would pass -- have to pass the House. And so I think the chances of backing off, off the cliff are higher than they ever have been.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You know, I listened to some of these recalcitrant House Republicans today, Mark. And they were saying, I was not going to vote for a tax increase, when my constituents would never have gone along with that.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Well, I think there's two realities, here, Judy.\n\nFirst of all, there's a lot of Republicans, and more than a few Democrats, who are terrified of one thing. That's being primaried, a primary opponent who is going to run on your right if you are a Republican, on your left if you are a Democrat. But it's really become a problem for Republicans, because this has been an article of faith that -- said before it is since 1990 that any Republican in the House or the Senate has voted for a tax increase on Capitol Hill, any Republican.\n\nNow, of the 241 Republicans now in the House, 212 of them have come to the Congress since 1990. So, they have never voted for a tax increase. They don't know anybody who has voted for a tax increase. And they were being asked to vote for a tax increase for a tactical advantage on a piece of legislation that they knew the president, A., would veto, B., wouldn't pass the Senate.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Only on people earning over a million.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: A million dollars, but they were going to give up their virginity, their political virginity, and risk a primary challenge -- that is how they saw it -- by doing this.\n\nWhat they failed to address is the reality that, when you are the -- part of the governing party in any institution, the House, the Senate, anyplace else, you have a responsibility to make sure that you can govern. And what they did was, they robbed the Republicans, that 40 to 50. They robbed the Republicans of that -- that sense of leadership, of governability, and robbed them, I think, and reduced the brand of the Republican Party even more.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is it a fundamental disagreement over what governing is?\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Yes, I think that that is part of it.\n\nI think what they couldn't answer is how they are going to get a better result. . .\n\nMARK SHIELDS: That's right.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: . . . after you -- when you go over the cliff, or later on in these negotiations, because they're not. This actually undermines their negotiating power and position, which -- because it is a foolish position to be in.\n\nBut it does -- it raises some really big issues. I mean, one of them here is that we now have a president and a speaker who both wanted a deal, OK? By every account, they wanted a deal. They tried it twice. And they couldn't make it happen.\n\nNow, they -- and I don't think they can make it happen. It's a serious kind of governing challenge right now. If you look, we have got a short-term political crisis. We have a long-term fiscal crisis. And we're providing no confidence whatsoever that we can approach those things as a government in a mature way.\n\nWe look increasingly like we have the dysfunction, the governmental dysfunction of Europe, without the excuse of being separate countries. And, you know, I think it's a serious challenge to America's standing in the world, that -- the views of credit markets. And Washington is not taking that yet with sufficiency seriously -- seriousness.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Yes.\n\nI would just add, and not in a partisan way, but the 213 -- 215-209 vote last night in the House before the whole thing came apart, which was that -- to not take the sequestration funds out of defense, but to take them out of domestic spending, was a party-line vote; 209 Democrats stuck on that. Not a single one broke.\n\nAnd I think -- I think you are seeing far more unity in the Democratic ranks than you are in the Republican ranks right now. I agree it is a governmental problem. If the whole thing comes to a grinding halt and we see it reflected in the financial markets and the stock market and elsewhere, then it's a governmental problem. It's not simply a Democratic advantage, a Republican advantage.\n\nBut, right now, the real fault lines are in the Republican Caucus.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we don't -- sounds like neither one -- none of us knows where this is headed.\n\nSo let's move to another subject.\n\nMichael, the president today named John Kerry to be secretary of state. It had been widely believed he wanted to choose the U.N. ambassador, Susan Rice.\n\nJohn Kerry -- what do you make of the choice?\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Well, it's a -- I think, a safe choice and a good choice. I mean, this is a man who has had three decades on the Foreign Relations Committee, former presidential candidate, would have immediate standing on the global stage, similar to Hillary Clinton, in this kind of job.\n\nHe's also been a troubleshooter for the president in some key ways, under the radar screen. When South Sudan was separating from the North, and it looked like those negotiations were breaking down, Kerry came in and really made a difference there. So, I think that, I mean, he looks good after the Rice nomination. He is a less controversial nominee.\n\nHe has a lot of respect among his colleagues in the Senate. And so I think that the president -- you know, it was not -- not particularly a hard choice.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: I think James Mann and David Ignatius put it very well, I mean, that he is -- he is experienced, probably unmatched in experience. He does bring considerable stature, on a first-name basis with many of the people around the world with whom he will be dealing. He has done, as David pointed out, back-channel missions for the president, whether it's dealing with Hamas, Afghanistan, Pakistan.\n\nAnd he is eminently confirmable. That's in the Senate. There is no question about it. And it opens up a possibility of a Republican seat in Massachusetts. So, Republicans are cheered by that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, just quickly, before we leave that, there was a -- and this -- we heard this mentioned earlier, that some -- there is still conversation about whether the president is going to name, may name Chuck Hagel, former Republican senator, to be secretary of defense.\n\nA lot of criticism has risen up. Outside groups are saying they are going to defeat him if he's named. What is going on there?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Yes.\n\nWell, I mean, certainly, Chuck Hagel has been subjected to withering criticism for his lack of constant or at least unswerving support of every Israeli administration. That has been a central part. There are people who have personal issues with Chuck Hagel.\n\nI personally think, A., he's close to the president. He was close to the president when the president was in the Senate. And I think he brings to it credentials that are sadly lacking in this administration. I mean, this is somebody who has spilled blood, shed blood for his own country, spilled blood for his country, faced combat, chose to go to Vietnam.\n\nHe had orders to go to Germany as an enlisted man. He insisted on going to Vietnam, where he faced serious combat. I just think -- I think he brings to it the first Vietnam veteran to be secretary of defense and the only enlisted man ever to be Secretary of Defense. I think those are credentials that are needed.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Any thoughts on that?\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: I think that, sometimes, people say these trial balloons are a sign of presidential weakness if they don't go up.\n\nThey're not really. They're actually a smart way for a president to gauge this. I think the opposition to Hagel is growing. I think it is rooted in disagreements, not just about Israel, but about defense cuts, but about his views on Iran, which are significantly to the left of president, and because he has -- he doesn't have a lot of respect of former colleagues here, which are already coming out, and many of them in opposition.\n\nI think it's an unlikely nomination.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you both to the gun control discussion.\n\nWe heard from the head of the NRA, Mark, today, Wayne LaPierre, who is advocating putting an armed guard in every school. The president has launched a task force this week. Where do you see this headed?\n\nMARK SHIELDS: I mean, to call Wayne LaPierre and the NRA have a tin ear, I think is an understatement. I mean, they seem to be almost whining about criticism of their position, that it somehow was rooted in the press bias or elected officials who have gun-free school zones.\n\nYou know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the -- all the wars, all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years.\n\nWe have half the guns that are in the world are in the United States. I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Something like 280 million guns.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Yes. And we're not going to get rid of all those guns. That's not going to happen. The question is. . .\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Well, we could do -- we could do Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and tax ammunition.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Well, yes.\n\nI think that there -- but there are a series of reasonable measures we could take, even going back to what we were doing in the 1990s, when it comes to ammunition, and magazine size, and assault -- certain types of semiautomatic weapons.\n\nYou should be able to make that case. We have swung so far in this debate in the libertarian direction, that those are fairly minimal burdens on anyone's rights when it comes to this that might have a marginal positive in fact -- impact on gun violence.\n\nBut any solution is also going have to deal with mental health issues. Security in schools, I don't think it's practical to put armed people in tens of thousands of schools. But security in schools, as well as reasonable gun controls, we're going to have to do a bunch of things in this area.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Sobering topic, and we will be coming back to it.\n\nMichael Gerson, Mark Shields, thank you both.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy. Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And Merry Christmas.\n\nMICHAEL GERSON: Merry Christmas.\n\nMARK SHIELDS: Merry Christmas to you. Thank you.",

Below is the full transcript, as provided by CNN. A news video is embedded below.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday at 6 p.m. PDT, 9 p.m. EDT and 2 a.m. GMT, The Ticket will live-blog the sole debate between Republican Sharron Angle and Democrat Harry Reid in their race for Nevada\u2019s Senate seat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFull transcript of the Christine O\u2019Donnell-Chris Coons Senate Debate\n\nNANCY KARIBJANIAN, DELAWARE FIRST MEDIA: I\u2019m Nancy Karibjanian for Delaware First Media.\n\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: And good evening, I\u2019m Wolf Blitzer from CNN.\n\nThank you so much for joining us for what\u2019s certain to be one of the most widely watched events of this, the 2010 midterm election season.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s introduce the candidates. Joining us for this debate this evening, Democratic Chris Coons, welcome. And Republican Christine O\u2019Donnell, welcome.\n\nCHRISTINE O\u2019DONNELL, (R-DE) SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We also want to thank AARP Delaware and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network for their support making this debate possible.\n\nBLITZER: And let\u2019s go through some of the rules, some of the ground rules for this 90-minute debate. It\u2019s divided into two parts. Following a two-minute opening statement from each candidate, Nancy and I will pose questions. Responses to that initial question limited to two minutes with a one-minute rebuttal from the other candidate. And then there will be an opportunity for all of us to mix it up a little bit, to get into a discussion, and follow up. That\u2019s the first hour. The first 60 minutes of this debate.\n\nThat will be followed by a 30-minute segment, during which we turn to the students here at the University of Delaware. They have questions.\n\nResponses to their questions will be limited to one minute. Each candidate will also have two minutes at the end for a closing statement.\n\nOur live audience here in Mitchell Hall understands, we hope, that there will be no applause during tonight\u2019s debate. We want everyone to be quiet and listen and learn from these two candidates.\n\nA coin toss determined earlier the order for this evening. We begin with two-minute opening statements from each of the candidates, and we begin with Chris Coons.\n\nCHRIS COONS, (D-DE) SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you. Thank you, President Harker.\n\nTo our moderators, Wolf Blitzer, Nancy Karibjanian, and to our hosts, UD Center for Political Communications and Delaware First Media.\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal at stake in this election for our state, for our families and for....\n\n... our country. All of us, regardless of our political leanings, recognize that Washington is broken. As I\u2019ve traveled up and down the state the last nine months as a candidate listening to voters talk about the issues facing them in their daily lives, I\u2019ve heard again and again their frustration with Washington and with elected officials who are putting narrow partisan agendas ahead of the good of our country and doing little to help millions of Americans out of work or on the verge of losing their homes or who are anxious about their futures.\n\nThe partisan gridlock in Washington has real implications for us in Delaware. There\u2019s more than 35,000 Delawareans still out of work and nearly 3,000 families that have faced foreclosure this year. These aren\u2019t just numbers. In Delaware, these are our neighbors. And we can\u2019t simply stand by and watch Washington ignore us or them any longer.\n\nIn this election, Delaware\u2019s voters face a clear and important choice between, on the one hand, my opponent, a candidate who wants to take our state and candidate back to the failed economic policies of the past, who values partisan bickering over compromise and solutions. And who I believe has extreme positions that threaten vital education programs and would abandon our commitment to our veterans.\n\nAnd on the other hand, in my case, a candidate with a proven track record of balancing budgets, finding bipartisan solutions, working with Delaware\u2019s businesses large and small, helping to create jobs and spur growth.\n\nOver the next 90 minutes, I look forward to the chance to share with you my ideas and values, Delaware values that I learned growing up in Hokesen, working here in Newark with one of Delaware\u2019s most innovative manufacturing companies and leading Delaware\u2019s second largest government.\n\nI take seriously the idea this campaign is a job interview. And tonight\u2019s debate is about giving Delaware\u2019s voters an insight into which candidate has the experience, the values, and the ideas to best represent them and do the hard work of fixing what\u2019s broken in Washington.\n\nThank you.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Your opening statement.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nThank you to our hosts and for everyone being here tonight. I\u2019m running because I\u2019m concerned about the direction of our country. The America we knew and grew up with is being threatened in the most serious way. In just three years, we will be paying $1 billion a day on the interest alone on our national debt.\n\nThe common sense men and women in this room, and all across Delaware, know this is not sustainable. Yet my opponent wants to go to Washington and rubber-stamp the failed spending bills that are coming from -- that have cost us 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is wrong. Uncle Sam needs to be cut off.\n\nWith your vote and your support, I want to go to Washington to create jobs based on private business, not your tax dollars. I want to fight to have our nation become debt free. I want to stop the tax hikes that are coming in January. I want to reach sustainable energy independence, support the military, and strengthen the security of our homeland. I want to fight to safeguard Social Security, improve education, and protect our constitutional liberties.\n\nAnd in an election year, when so much is at stake, just about every candidate says this, yet what distinguishes one candidate from another are the proposed solutions to reach these goals. I very much look forward to getting down to brass tacks with all of you over the next 90 minutes because I believe there is a clear choice in this election. A vote for my opponent will cost the average Delaware family $10,000 instantly between the January tax hikes and his vote for cap and trade.\n\nMost of us can\u2019t afford that. If you think that government is too small and that your taxed too little, if you\u2019re ever questioned whether America is a beacon of freedom and justice, then he\u2019s your guy. But if you want a U.S. senator who will stand up to the Washington elite, who will put your interests ahead of the special interests, and make the tough decisions needed to rein in an out of control Washington, then I humbly ask you to vote O\u2019Donnell for U.S. Senate.\n\nThank you.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: All right. We\u2019re now getting into our question portion of the evening.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll begin with you, Mr. Coons. Creating jobs to get America back to work clearly has to be a priority to do. Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democrats during the last election, because most felt that the Democrats would be able to fix the failing economy. Unemployment is at 9.6%, almost three quarters of Americans in the most recent CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll said that the economy is still in a recession.\n\nSo why should the voters of Delaware trust a Democrat this time around?\n\nCOONS: Well, Nancy, thanks for your question. I think the voters of Delaware should trust this Democrat because of my combination of experience working in the private sector and working with the private sector. Hands-on work, helping one of Delaware\u2019s most innovative companies expand and grow jobs and concrete and engaged work working with our Chamber of Commerce, our business roundtable, the Committee of 100, lots of groups who represent businesses large and small to effectively grow the economy.\n\nI\u2019ve also presented as a candidate for the Senate concrete and real ideas.\n\nThey\u2019re on my web site but I look forward to the chance to go over them in some detail tonight.\n\nI would advocate for a research and development tax credit and expand our tax credit that\u2019s combined with a new manufacturing tax credit that advocates for companies that invent things here and make them here, getting an extra inventive.\n\nI also think we need to change the crazy tax policy in Washington that gives an incentive to American companies to shut down operations here and ship jobs overseas.\n\nThere\u2019s other things I\u2019ve proposed \u2013 expanding the home office tax credit, expanding a tax credit for starting a new business that employs folks within the first couple of years, fighting harder in trade policy to make sure we\u2019re not letting our trading partners take advantage of us in trade deals that were signed over previous years, doing more in investment and innovation.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Delaware has a long tradition of inventing and manufacturing world class products. The best way for us to get out of this recession is through growth. The best way to growth is by taking advantage of the skills and resources of a world class university like this one where we\u2019re having this debate this evening and tying that to a stronger more qualified more capable workforce, giving it the resources and the energy it needs to be once again the leader in the world in creating high quality, high value manufacturing jobs.\n\nThose are some of the ideas I look forward to discussing more this evening. Thank you.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Ms. O\u2019Donnell, you have one minute for a rebuttal.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, first, we have to keep in mind my opponent has a history of promising not to raise taxes on the campaign trail and then break those promises as soon as he takes office. Unemployment here in New Castle County rose, almost doubled in the last two years under his watch as New Castle county executive.\n\nNow, when it comes to the policies that he has said on the campaign trail, he will continue to rubber-stamp the spending policies coming from Washington. We were promised that the stimulus bill would create jobs. But instead it cost us 2.6 million jobs. We were promised that it would keep unemployment at 8%, but instead we see unemployment at 9.7%.\n\nThe Democrats are bragging that unemployment has leveled out, but while unemployment has leveled out, more people than ever are on food stamps and our welfare spending is higher than ever. This is not the right move. This is not a move towards real economic recovery. This is a move towards creating a culture of dependency.\n\nI believe the best thing the government...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: That\u2019s the time, sorry.\n\nBut now we get to open it to discussion.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Great.\n\nBLITZER: Well, what specifically, Ms. O\u2019Donnell, would you do, specifically, to create jobs?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: What I think the best thing the government can do to get our economy back on real economic recovery is for -- to get out of the way of the small business owner and get out of the way of the entrepreneur.\n\nAnd the way you do that is to make sure these tax hikes don\u2019t come in January. You begin to roll back some of the regulation that\u2019s forced them to close their doors.\n\nA couple of that things I\u2019m proposing. And number one, a temporary two-year tax holiday on the capital gains tax to give investors the money they need to reinvest in business, to permanently eliminate the death tax. That\u2019s not only an unjust bill because we\u2019ve paid taxes while we saved it, but it will also create 1.5 million new jobs.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let me just remind that we are in the discussion portion so you can interject here as well as we continue to discussion that point.\n\nCOONS: I\u2019m not sure I understand what Ms. O\u2019Donnell means when she says this is simply create ago culture of dependency and that her primary objective would be to end the endless regulation and red tape. She denounces the Obama administration, says its done nothing to promote job growth when frankly, just a few weeks ago, a new bill that would provide expanded SBA loan capacity, $30 billion worth of new lending capability, TARP funds that have been repaid, and are being repurchased towards small and midsized banks all over the United States. Real and concrete steps are being taken.\n\nI also frankly can\u2019t imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch. I ssuspect we\u2019re going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth.\n\nBLITZER: Let\u2019s ask her, where did you get those numbers?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: The Department of Labor statistics. And we\u2019ll have them on our web site by tomorrow.\n\nBut I want to point out that he said that we\u2019re not creating a culture of dependency. How would you explain what is happening when unemployment is leveled out, but more and more people are on food stamps? We\u2019ve got to ask ourselves, what do we want Delawareans to be receiving, food stamps or paychecks? I say paychecks.\n\nCOONS: Obviously paychecks. We\u2019d like to have Americans able to receive the benefits they need to get through incredibly difficult times. But to simply denounce people as being dependent because they\u2019re applying for and receiving food stamps...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Oh, Chris, that\u2019s not fair...\n\nCOONS: ...in the worst recession in modern times...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: That\u2019s not fair of you to say\n\nCOONS: Is frankly slandering people who are in incredibly difficult times.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: That fair of you to say that, because that\u2019s not at all what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not the person who would cut the tax benefits for disabled and low-income senior citizens, as you did as county executive.\n\nBut what I\u2019m proposing is to give these tax -- to make sure that the tax cults for our Delawareans do not expire this January. You have said that you will stop the tax cuts for the so-called rich. What you fail to realize is the so-called rich are the small business owner, the dry-cleaner down the street, the pizza shop owner who makes $300,000 before they pay their four employees, before they feed their own family...\n\nBLITZER: I\u2019ll have you respond.\n\nCOONS: Ms. O\u2019Donnell, we\u2019re going to try to have a conversation here this evening, rather than just a diatribe if we possibly could. I think it would be helpful to have an exchange of ideas and let each of us take turns so thank you for moderating, Wolf.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to look closely at some of the things Ms.\n\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s thrown out on her new web site. Most of them are untrue.\n\nSome of them are flat-out lies. Some of them are mischaracterizations.\n\nSome are just factually untrue. So, I\u2019m not going to stop every single time there\u2019s something she throws out that I disagree with or I think is factually untrue.\n\nBut let me just say at the outset, that much of what you\u2019ve put out, much of how you\u2019ve characterized my record is incorrect. And if we simply sit here and say, that\u2019s not true, we\u2019re not going to make much progress.\n\nBLITZER: Do you support keeping the Bush tax cuts for all Americans or only those make under $200,000 a year?\n\nCOONS: I suppose extending the Bush tax cuts for the overwhelming majority of Americans. I don\u2019t think we should draw an arbitrary line at $250,000. But the value that I will apply as deciding how much to extend, whether it goes up to $1 million or $2 million, or $5 millions that we\u2019ve got a tough choice to make. Every increased tax cut, every extension that\u2019s given, is going to cost, it\u2019s going to increase the deficit, it adds to the debt.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the primary value I would apply in deciding whether to extend all the Bush tax cuts and for how long. I think we should do those tax cuts that have the best chance of getting our economy going again...\n\nBLITZER: All right...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We\u2019re out of time though for this discussion.\n\nBLITZER: But you\u2019re going to have an opportunity to get back into this discussion because this is issue number one \u2013 jobs, jobs, jobs. Also, the deficit. I want to get into the deficit right now. You\u2019ve made the point that the national debt is exploding, the budget deficit is exploding right now. I want some specific meaningful cuts, if you\u2019re elected a senator from Delaware, what would you cut in the federal budget? And don\u2019t just say waste, fraud and abuse, because everybody says that. What would you cut specifically?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: That\u2019s a great question because first of all we have got to tackle the deficit and the debt because our deficit is almost becoming equal to our national GDP. When your deficit -- a country\u2019s deficit equals your GDP, that\u2019s when your currency collapses, your market collapses. We\u2019ve got to take drastic measures.\n\nBLITZER: So what would you cut?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: First of all, cancel the unspent stimulus bill. Second of all, put a freeze on non-discretionary -- on discretionary spending, put a hiring freeze on nonsecurity personnel. And then, of course, when we\u2019re talking about cutting government spending, we\u2019ve got to talk about waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nA recent report came out said we spend over $1 billion in Medicaid waste fraud and abuse. We\u2019re talking about pharmacies billing for prescriptions given to dead people. We\u2019re talking about home health care companies billing for patients who were in the hospital.\n\nSenator Coburn recently put out a report called schoolhouse pork that disclosed millions of dollars that were supposed to go to education funding that instead went to special favors.\n\nNow, special favors are something that my opponent knows very much about because he created 12 contingency funds so that he could pay out favors to special interest groups. The courts forced him to close 11 of them.\n\nBut of the one that remained open, he paid $53,000 in a men\u2019s fashion show. He paid another -- more than $50,000, to appease liberal special interest groups.\n\nAt a time when he brags about balancing the budget by raising our taxes, cutting policemen pay, this is how he chooses to spend our tax dollars.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to ask, do we want to send this gentleman to Washington, D.C.?\n\nI would say no.\n\nHe\u2019s a career politician who has proven he knows how to play the I\u2019ll scratch your back, you scratch mine game.\n\nBLITZER: You have a minute to respond.\n\nCOONS: There\u2019s so much to respond to Wolf, a minute may not be enough.\n\nLet me get back to the focus of the question, is what would you do to tackle the deficit and the debt? I think we have some very large challenges in front of us. The overwhelming majority of federal spending is made up by defense spending, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest on the debt.\n\nWhile the president has proposed, and I would seriously consider supporting, a freeze on non defense discretionary spending for three years, which would achieve significant reductions. I\u2019ve also identified on my web site a series of reductions that I would support. Some of them are in agricultural price supports. Some are in federal office space, for example, or hiring. And several are in defense programs.\n\nDefense acquisition that the Pentagon itself has already said they no longer need. The C-17 program for example, or the second engine for the F-35. There\u2019s a variety of platforms and programs that I think we can simply do away with. As we invest in making our defense and our military more modern, more flexible, more responsive to the real threats we face in the modern world. And as we continue to achieve some savings through the BRAC program and other things that have shown a real capacity to save.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s open the discussion on correcting some of the financial issues here by talk about some of your own personal financial problems. And most people know about it by now, including an IRS lien that was for about $12,000 in taxes and penalties from \u201905. There was the \u201908 mortgage default judgment on your home. You just received your bachelors degree, as you said, because it took a decade to pay of the tuition.\n\nThe question, then is, how can voters rely upon your thoughts on how to manage the deficit if you\u2019re having such personal financial issues of your own?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, first of all, that IRS tax lien, the IRS already admitted that it was a computer error and my opponent should not be bringing that up, because as I\u2019ve gone up and down the campaign trail, I\u2019ve discovered there are thousands of Delawareans who have faced the same thing. An IRS mistake has caused them greatly, which is all the more reason why we need to reform the IRS, not put them in control of our health care.\n\nSecond of all, you mentioned education. I don\u2019t have a trust fund. I didn\u2019t come from a privileged, sheltered background as my opponent says he did...\n\nKARIBJANIAN:: Let\u2019s stay to the issue of paying bills...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I am. I paid for my own college education. I also have a graduate fellowship in constitutional government from the Claremont Institute. I know how hard it is to earn and keep a dollar. And one of the reasons why the Delawareans should be able to trust me is because when I did in this economy, I worked for nonprofit groups. Nonprofit groups were the first to have been hurt. When I fell upon difficult times, I made the sacrifices needed to set things right. I sold my house. And I sold a lot of my possessions in order to pay of my personal debt and to become in a stronger position.\n\nI have worked hard in order to get to the position that I am. So I can relate to the thousands of Delaware families that are suffering right now. And I\u2019m stronger for it. I made it through to the other side. And that\u2019s where -- leadership doesn\u2019t count in whether or not you fall, it counts in whether or not you\u2019ve gotten up and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s just remember we\u2019re in the discussion portion so if you have anything you want to address on things that have been said on this topic thus far, go for it.\n\nCOONS: Well Nancy, I frankly think that we need to focus in this debate this evening and in the campaign, not on personal financial difficulties or background earns but on the issues in front of us, the things that Delawareans are concerned about \u2013 how do we tackle the deficit and debt, how do we get Delaware back to work?\n\nThere\u2019s been lots of discussion in the national media about things my opponent has said or done that I frankly think are a distraction from the core issues that Delawareans ask about \u2013 ask both of us about.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: You\u2019re just jealous that you weren\u2019t \u2013\n\nCOONS: What would you do in Washington?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: -- on \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019\n\nCOONS: I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m dying to see who\u2019s going to play me, Christine.\n\nBLITZER: Well, let\u2019s \u2013 on a serious note, let\u2019s get through some of the accusations that she\u2019d made and \u2013 and we\u2019ll give you a chance to respond.\n\nCOONS: Please.\n\nBLITZER: That \u2013\n\nCOONS: On the idea that somehow I was the one responsible for being sued for creating 11, 12 \u2013 she\u2019s confusing me with my predecessor, Tom Gordon.\n\nBLITZER: What we\u2019re talking about is County Executive \u2013\n\nCOONS: Yes.\n\nBLITZER: -- New Castle County Executive. You raised property taxes, according to reports, three times, 25 percent hike in the last fiscal year. You proposed new taxes on hotels, paramedic services, even 911 calls from cell phones. Is that true?\n\nCOONS: No. It\u2019s not true that we proposed a tax on the calls to the 911 center. In any case \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNEL: It\u2019s not true.\n\nCOONS: -- research into that would reveal that. It\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s complicated, but I\u2019ll take \u2013 I\u2019ll take a \u2013\n\nBLITZER: Well, explain your record on \u2013 on taxes. Did you increase taxes as the county executive?\n\nCOONS: Wolf, let me walk you through, for a moment, what\u2019s happened, because one of the attacks my opponent\u2019s made repeatedly is that I\u2019ve driven the county to the edge of bankruptcy. That\u2019s on her newest attack. Nothing could be the further from the truth.\n\nToday, New Castle County has a surplus. When I became executive in \u201805, it had a deficit. I have worked hard over six years to defend a very significant reserve, which has made it possible for us to continue to have a Triple-A bond rating. Out of 3,000 \u2013 roughly 3,000 counties in America, roughly 30 have a Triple-A bond rating, and I reached a bipartisan solution \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNEL: It says stop.\n\nCOONS: -- that cut more in spending than was raised in taxes.\n\nBLITZER: All right, a quick response and then we\u2019ll move to the next \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: You\u2019ve been criticized for saying that you brought the county to Triple A bond rating. You inherited that good rating. And how would you justify cutting the tax exception for low income seniors and disabled seniors, cutting our policeman pay when you wastefully spent so much money on appeasing the special interest groups?\n\nYou simply can\u2019t justify that. That is a career politician. That is cronyism. We don\u2019t need any more of that in Washington.\n\nBLITZER: Very quickly, because we got to move to the next series of questions, do you want to respond to that?\n\nCOONS: There\u2019s a lot to respond to in that.\n\nBLITZER: Do it in 30 seconds.\n\nCOONS: That\u2019s going to be difficult, Wolf.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m proud of my record as New Castle County Executive. The very hard choices that had to be made to clean up the government \u2013 every time you get a bond rating, you earned a bond rating.\n\nMs. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s not familiar with how bond ratings work. Each time you go to the bond market, you are re-rated. Moody\u2019s, in their letter of rating just two weeks ago, said that it was because of the conservative fiscal policies of my administration that we have re-earned a Triple A bond rating from all three agencies.\n\nBLITZER: All right. Let\u2019s move on to the next series of questions on national security, foreign policy, right now. A hundred thousand American men and women are serving in the military in Afghanistan right now. The president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has now acknowledged he\u2019s in direct talks with the Taliban leadership, wants to create what he calls a peace council.\n\nHere\u2019s the question, and it goes to Mr. Coons. Would you support a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan that includes Taliban representation? Would that be acceptable to you, a deal between Hamid Karzai and the Taliban?\n\nCOONS: Wolf, I\u2019m concerned about the security of our troops in the field and about honoring the service and the sacrifice of our veterans. The war in Afghanistan is the war of the two that we\u2019ve been engaged in, Iraq and Afghanistan, that I think was justified by a direct attack on the United States by the Taliban, who were offering harbor to al Qaeda, who were the authors of the 9\/11 attack.\n\nAnd I think in our 10th year now, on the ground in Afghanistan, we have to look hard at whether we\u2019re continuing to contribute to America\u2019s security by having 100,000 troops on the ground. I would support a negotiated resolution to the war that allowed us leave security and intelligence assets in place and that allowed us the opportunity to reengage, should the Taliban take control again, or allow al Qaeda to reemerge as a real threat to the region or to the United States.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent $1.3 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has significantly contributed to our debt. We have lost more than 5,000 American servicemen and women, and I\u2019ve got folks who I am personally close to who are deployed now for the third or fourth tour.\n\nWe have asked a lot of our men and women in the field. They have delivered brilliantly. But, frankly, the mission has exceeded the scope that I think we could initially reasonably expect of them.\n\nI am far more concerned about the threats to our security posed by an unstable Pakistan, posed by Iran, and posed by an endless war in a country where we\u2019re trying to build a nation where there really hasn\u2019t been one in modern times.\n\nBLITZER: You have one minute to respond.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, I would ask him, if he\u2019s serious about making sure that Afghanistan doesn\u2019t become a safe haven for terrorists, why, on the campaign trail, he has said that he supports this random time withdrawal?\n\nWe have to support our men and women who are risking their lives. Many of them have already given their lives over there. A random withdrawal that he has said he support will simply embolden the terrorists to come out after us even more, saying I\u2019ve chased away the super power.\n\nWhen we withdraw from Iraq, we need to make sure that there are benchmarks in place. Those benchmarks are making sure that there\u2019s a government that \u2013 a representative government over there that serves the needs of the people and that can defend themselves. When we\u2019ve reached these benchmarks, that\u2019s when we withdraw.\n\nBLITZER: You want to respond to that?\n\nCOONS: She said withdraw from Iraq. I suspect you meant withdraw from Afghanistan.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: No. From Afghanistan. Did I say Iraq? I\u2019m sorry.\n\nThank you, Chris. You\u2019re correct. I meant Afghanistan.\n\nCOONS: If we\u2019re talking about Afghanistan \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Yes. Thank you.\n\nCOONS: -- and, you know, frankly, I come from a family of veterans. I come from a family that has dedicated a lot to the service of our nation, and I wear a flag pin every day to remain me of the young man who grew up next door to me, who was killed in Iraq in December of 2005.\n\nI never take lightly the enormous sacrifices that our servicemen and women have made now, and that we ask them to continue making. I don\u2019t know how long is too long, but 10 years strikes me as awfully long. And I question whether your standard, whether your principles, give us any hope of winding up this war on any reasonable timeline, because, frankly, the government of Hamid Karzai has proven itself to be largely corrupt, and to be frankly ineffective at establishing control over the whole country.\n\nWe are doing our best. We have dedicated trillions, hundreds of billions of dollars to this conflict, and I\u2019m frankly deeply concerned that it\u2019s a conflict without a reasonable end in sight.\n\nThere are times in history \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Saying that you\u2019re \u2013\n\nCOONS: -- the best way to honor the sacrifice of servicemen and women is to come up with a plan to responsibly wind down a conflict.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And that plan should be based on those benchmarks, the benchmarks that means that we have had success.\n\nAgain, you\u2019re saying hallow rhetoric, when you \u2013 you say that your top priority is the concern for the safety of us on the homeland if you seriously support this random time withdrawal. Because, again, all we\u2019re going to do is embolden the terrorists to think that they have more power than they do.\n\nAnd I would ask you, you know, a couple of times, whether it\u2019s the tax cuts or even here in this kind of veiled \u2013 you\u2019ve gone back and forth on what you just said in Afghanistan. Do you support the president or don\u2019t you support the president? With the tax cuts you\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t support the president.\n\nCOONS: Ms. O\u2019Donnell, let\u2019s stay focused \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Are you going to tell him that when he comes on Friday?\n\nCOONS: -- let\u2019s stay focused on the issue in front of us, which is Afghanistan. You\u2019ve suggested gauzy benchmarks \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And it\u2019s you \u2013 you\u2019re jumping around.\n\nCOONS: No, we\u2019re staying focused on the issue of Afghanistan rather than jumping to other issues.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And you jumped around. You said that security \u2013\n\nCOONS: Ms. O\u2019Donnell \u2013\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s let \u2013 let\u2019s let \u2013\n\nCOONS: The core issue here \u2013\n\nKARIBJANIAN: -- Mr. Coons finish his point.\n\nCOONS: The core issue here is what reasonable prospect do you have for.... ... these gauzy benchmarks and timelines you suggest to ever actually result in a withdrawal?\n\nIn Iraq, there was a modern nation. There was a central government.\n\nThere was infrastructure in place. In Afghanistan, there hasn\u2019t been a nation in decades. And so, despite our 10 years of incredible effort, we are not succeeding in building a nation.\n\nAs you put it, if the benchmark is self-governance, stability, security, we had a decent shot \u2013\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\nCOONS: -- of that in Iraq.\n\nBLITZER: I want to \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, if you remember, when we were fighting the Soviets over there in Afghanistan in the \u201880s and \u201890s, we did not finish the job. So now we have a responsibility to finish the job. And if you\u2019re going to make these politically correct statements that it\u2019s costing us too much money, you are threatening the security of our homeland.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We\u2019re about to wrap up this topic. Let\u2019s just get there real quickly and ask yes or a no answer. Are \u2013 is this nation more secure than it was under President Bush? Yes or no?\n\nCOONS: Yes.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Today? Yes or no.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: No.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: OK.\n\nWe\u2019ll move on to our next topic, and this question goes to Ms. O\u2019Donnell.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Can I give \u2013 can I say why? I mean, we had more \u2013\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We \u2013 no. We\u2019re really \u2013\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: -- terrorist attacks on our homeland.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: -- sorry, but we do need to move on.\n\nI know that we\u2019ve said that the statements out in the national media, the \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 skits are distractions. I appreciate that, but to the voter in Delaware, it is the message that they are receiving. So we would be remiss if we did not address this issue.\n\nSo the comments that you\u2019ve made in the past, which are in your own words because they\u2019re on the videotape, have become the fodder for the late night TV shows. You even released an ad that opened up by saying \u2018I am not a witch\u2019 and a local newspaper columnist said that the comments that you\u2019ve been \u2013 seemed to be making make Delawareans cringe.\n\nSo what do you say to voters who want the change but are uncomfortable by these remarks?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: This election cycle should not be about comments I made on a comedy show over a decade and a half ago. This election cycle should be about what is important to the people of Delaware, how we\u2019re going to get real jobs back to Delaware, how we\u2019re going to get our economy back on track, how we\u2019re going to protect our senior citizens and safeguard our social security. These are the issues that Delawareans are concerned about.\n\nYou know, as, Wolf, you can attest, I have not welcomed this media attention. You\u2019ve been asking for an interview for quite a long time. My priority has been getting back to the Delaware voters, meeting as many voters, going to as many community forums as possible so that we can counter these things.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: My opponent has said that the statements that we made in our 20s should be off the table, and after he made that statement, days later, he started running ads. In his own campaign materials, he\u2019s going back on his word using those statements to misrepresent my character.\n\nSo, again, I thank you for the opportunity for the Delaware voters to get to know who I am and what I\u2019m all about because what I can assure them is, while I made statements, my faith has matured over the years but regardless of my personal faith, when I go down to Washington, D.C., it is the constitution that I will defend and it is by the constitution that I will make all of my decisions, and that will be the standard bearer for every piece of legislation that I will vote on.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Mr. Coons, you have a one-minute rebuttal.\n\nCOONS: I was surprised to see in the newspaper an interview profile of both of us, Miss O\u2019Donnell\u2019s statement, pretty similar to what you just heard from her that she would not have her faith be a central driver of her decisions if elected. And I\u2019m interested if we can explore further your suggestion that the Constitution would be your guide. Because I\u2019m interested in hearing whether it\u2019s the Constitution as passed by the founders, the Constitution of 1920, 1930, the Constitution of 1975, the Constitution of today. Because to me, protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, protecting reproductive freedom, and making sure that we\u2019ve got on the record Miss O\u2019Donnell\u2019s views on things like prayer, abortion, evolution, is important. These aren\u2019t just random statements on some late-night TV show. These are relevant to her service in the United States Senate, what sort of judges she would confirm, what sort of issues she would take up. I\u2019m someone who stands firmly behind the constitution as it stands today. I respect stare decisis, the decided cases, the case law that governs the United States.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: All right but let\u2019s go to the issue of faith and politics, because you were a student pastor at Yale. You also said in an interview once that you thought you would either end up a preacher, a professor or a politician. You\u2019ve occasionally been a guest speaker at some of the churches here in our community, Baptist churches, Presbyterian churches to name a few. So how much of an influence does this faith in your life have on your politics?\n\nCOONS: Faith is a central part of how my wife and I are raising our three children, of why we decide to do the community service and the outreach that we do but ours is a faith that we think a general motivation towards public service, towards trying to create a community that\u2019s more tolerant, inclusive, and just, and towards the sort of forgiveness, healing and reconciliation that we think is the central message of our faith. But I also think, as someone who has been elected ten years, I\u2019ve learned to reach a balance where my private faith, the aspects of my faith that are religious doctrine, don\u2019t influence the decisions that I\u2019ve made for the public in my ten years in county office.\n\nBLITZER: Let\u2019s give you a chance to respond to some of the things she said because in a television appearance back in 1998 on Bill Maher\u2019s show you said evolution is a myth. Do you believe evolution is a myth?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I believe that the local -- I was talking about what a local school taught and that should be taught -- that should be decided on the local community. But please let me respond to what he just said.\n\nBLITZER: We\u2019ll let you respond but answer the question. Do you believe evolution is a myth?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Local schools should make that decision. I made that remark based on --\n\nBLITZER: What do you believe?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: What I believe is irrelevant.\n\nBLITZER: Why is it irrelevant?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Because what I would support \u2026\n\nBLITZER: Voters want to know.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: What I will support in Washington, D.C. is the ability for the local school system to decide what is taught in their classrooms and what I was talking about on that show was a classroom that was not allowed to teach creationism as an equal theory as evolution. That is against their constitutional rights and that is an overreaching arm of the government.\n\nBut, please allow me at least the full minute to respond to what he said because he said these statements that we made should be taken into consideration when casting your vote. So then I would be remiss not to bring up the fact that my opponent has recently said that it was studying under a Marxist professor that made him become a Democrat. So when you look at his position on things like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism -- I would argue that there are more people who support my Catholic faith than his Marxist beliefs, and I\u2019m using his own words.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We\u2019re going to clarify that.\n\nBLITZER: Because a lot of people remember, because they\u2019ve learned in last few weeks you did once describe yourself when you were in college a long time ago as a bearded Marxist.\n\nCOONS: Great question, Wolf. I hope folks will go and read the article.\n\nIt\u2019s an article that I wrote as a senior the day of our commencement speech and the title and the content of that clearly makes it obvious that it was a joke. There was a group of folks who I had shared a room with, my roommates junior year, who are in the Young Republican Club and who thought when I returned from Kenya and registered as a Democrat that doing so was proof that I had gone all the way over to the far left end, and so they jokingly called me a bearded Marxist. If you take five minutes and read the article, it\u2019s clear on the face of it, it was a joke. Despite that, my opponent and lots of folks in the right wing media have endlessly spun this. I am not now, nor have I ever been, anything but a clean-shaven capitalist.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, I would -- I would stand to disagree because, first of all, if you\u2019re saying what I said on a comedy show is relevant to this election, then absolutely you writing an article, forget the bearded Marxist comment, you writing an article saying that you learned your beliefs from an articulate, intelligent Marxist professor and that\u2019s what made you become a Democrat, that should send chills up the spine of every Delaware voter because then if you compare that statement to your policies --\n\nCOONS: If it were accurate, if it were true, I\u2019d agree. But it\u2019s not accurate. It\u2019s not true.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: You said that on MSNBC just a few weeks ago. You said that on MSNBC.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s go to an issue that you brought up about being schools and this goes to you first, Mr. Coons. This is the issue of education in our country. And in many public school districts all across America, as they\u2019re trying to get in accountability in the classroom, it is very difficult to dismiss an underperforming teacher because of the stringent contracts that have been negotiated with the individual school districts and teacher unions. Do you feel teacher unions are too powerful?\n\nCOONS: Nancy, one of the things I\u2019ve complemented both Delaware\u2019s teachers and Delaware\u2019s governor for is their remarkable progress under the race to the top program. One of I think the best parts of the Obama\/Biden administration\u2019s progress on education, I like both the process and the outcome. They set a very high bar. They offered a federal pot of money that was available or for those states that were willing to make significant changes and Delaware and Tennessee were two states that made that progress. Delaware\u2019s teachers union, the DSEA, came to the table and with the leadership of the Governor Markell, made significant changes, things a lot of folks predicted they wouldn\u2019t do to embrace charters and to make them more powerful, to make it possible for schools that are underperforming to be shut down or restructured and to change a system so that teacher compensation could be tied towards improvement by students in the classroom. I think our teachers deserve our support and I think our teachers have a long tradition of contributing significantly, not just to educating our children but to building a stronger and better community. My own mother and grandmother were school teachers and I deeply respect the hard work that they do.\n\nEarlier today I was at Eisenberg School in New Castle because this is National School Lunch Week. The work that our teachers do, the work that\u2019s done in early education from head start to full day kindergarten through K through 12 education, the work that\u2019s done here and in other great public universities around the state and country, is critical to laying the groundwork for our future. And I have no problem with recognizing that the folks who do the hard work, the teachers, and the paraprofessionals are entitled to a good standard of living, are entitled to be able to live a life where they have health care, they have a pension, and they have job security. I do think there are issues that we have to tackle and I think race to the top made significant progress in them in making sure schools are performing as best they can.\n\nBLITZER: You have a minute to respond.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, if you notice, he didn\u2019t answer the question as to whether or not he thought the teacher unions were too powerful, and that\u2019s probably because he got their endorsement.\n\nI would say that what we need to do especially here in Delaware where we spend so much money on education, it ends up going to the six-figure salaries of our bureaucrats and our superintendents, not to the teachers in the classroom.\n\nIt\u2019s appalling that in a state where we spend so much federal and state dollars on education, good teachers who want to get extra materials have to do so out of their pocket. I have met many teachers.\n\nI\u2019ve sat down with them and talked with them about their concerns with race from the top and whether they\u2019re Democrat or Republican a lot of them express that we are not spending our education dollars appropriately. We\u2019re not helping the classroom, and what\u2019s going to happen when this race to the top funding dries up?\n\nWe have a broken system especially in Wilmington where I live. We have an extremely high dropout rate. Throwing more money on a broken system is not going to work. Instead, what we need to do is sit down and have conversations with the teachers not the unions about what they need us to do to help them in their classroom.\n\nBLITZER: Over the years a number of conservatives have proposed eliminating the Department of Education in Washington. Do you support eliminating the Department of Education?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I don\u2019t think that we need to go to that drastic of a step, but as I said, Senator Coburn has released a report that shows where millions of dollars in Department of Education money has been abused.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of stuff we have to stop. We also have to make sure that the money we are putting into education does go to the classroom and make them more effective. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re ignoring. Every time that there\u2019s a problem, we just throw more money in it to appease the special interest groups. We\u2019re not getting to root of the problem and that\u2019s what we need to do, start getting to the root of the problem, which means talking to the teachers and not only that, putting the power back to the parents over whether they send their children to school.\n\nBLITZER: In a recent survey of 30 industrialized countries, the United States ranked 25th in math, 21st in science. Finland was first in math.\n\nSouth Korea was first in science. Specifically what would you do to make the United States number one, once again, in math and science?\n\nCOONS: Great question. And as someone who spent 20 years working with a non-profit foundation, the I Have a Dream Foundation, that raises money from private individuals and helps provide scholarships for students, for teachers, and for a college education, I\u2019ve been hands-on and engaged with some of the toughest schools in America and some teachers who are significantly under-supported by their districts and who needed additional resources to deliver on a promise of an effective education.\n\nI think there\u2019s a significant role, though, for the federal government in providing financial support and encouragement, scholarships for those teachers in STA, in science and technology, in engineering and math.\n\nWe need a new generation of teachers who are fully prepared, fully qualified to engage their students in the classroom, to use the latest teaching tools in media, to teach to the standards that No Child Left Behind established, and that need to be modernized and made more flexible and responsive. And we frankly need to use collaborative learning techniques.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re time-keeping here.\n\nBLITZER: I\u2019ll give you a very quick chance to respond. What would you do specifically to make the United States number one?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Again, what I would say to improve our education, we have to empower the teachers to do what they need to do to be more effective.\n\nThey\u2019re the ones on the first line of defense. They\u2019re the ones who have the most influence over our students.\n\nBut we also have to empower the parents. So I support charter schools and I support student vouchers -- or school vouchers so that it gives parents, regardless of income, regardless of status, an opportunity for their students to have a shot at a great education until our public schools do improve.\n\nBLITZER: Let\u2019s switch gears and talk about health care, which is such an important issue to millions and millions of Americans right now. Under the new health care law that was recently signed into law by the president, children now can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until the age of 26. People can no longer be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers, the big insurance companies, are prohibited from rescinding coverage if a customer becomes sick and they can\u2019t impose any lifetime limits on essential benefits like hospital stays or expensive treatments.\n\nYou say you want to repeal all of that?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, first of all, no one is disputing that our health care system before \u2018Obama-care\u2019 didn\u2019t need reform. Those are very important things that are part of insurance reform, not health care reform.\n\nIn the course of the public debate over health care reform, we\u2019ve begun to confuse coverage with care. Our goal should be to make health care more affordable. Even with \u2018Obama-care,\u2019 our most vulnerable in Delaware are still left uninsured and still left without access to quality health care.\n\nWhen we passed \u2018Obama-care,\u2019 we were promised that it would make more people insured. Well, recent CBO reports say that it\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually causing businesses to drop their policies because compliance standards are so high. Our laws, especially when it comes to health care, should not force businesses to break our laws.\n\nSecond of all, we were promised that more people -- that health care costs would be lowered. It hasn\u2019t. It has increased health care costs, according to recent reports. So what I want to do is to fight to fully repeal that so that we can begin to enact real reform. And that real reform would include allowing policy portability when you change jobs, allowing Delawareans to get policies across state lines.\n\nRight now we only have three options. That\u2019s not right. And I would also fight for some sort of tort reform that allowed doctors to not have to worry and practice medicine to prepare for the courtroom as opposed to the examination room, but at the same time this tort reform has to protect those patients who are victims of true medical malpractice.\n\nBLITZER: You have one minute to respond.\n\nCOONS: So much to say.\n\nI support the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. I think it made significant advances, and you outlined many of them. But there\u2019s additional investments in the bill to make sure that there\u2019s a breadth of coverage to rural areas, through the Health Services Corps, by recruiting and training a whole new generation of doctors and nurses, by expanding support for community health centers, and by also improving efficiency of our health care system.\n\nIt makes a landmark investment of $350 million over a decade to try and fight waste, fraud, and abuse, and increase those savings. And there were strategic investments in electronic medical systems that would allow electronic medical records to reduce injuries to patients, mistaken diagnoses, and mistaken treatments.\n\nAll of these in combination I think argue for extending, perfecting, and implementing this landmark bill. It\u2019s not perfect. There are problems with it. But I think rather than turning it back and repealing and going for another year or two of endless partisan bickering, this was a critical piece of legislation.\n\nNot a pretty process that passed it, but I would stand for it and implement it responsibly.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Well, we\u2019re now into part of the discussion on it. So let me just ask you then, the issue was brought up about malpractice reform, and Democrats are often accused of being too close to trial lawyers, and Republicans say that\u2019s why that there has not been the opportunity for reform in this area, and why it was not included in the health care bill.\n\nIf you were elected, would you work to amend that bill to include malpractice reform?\n\nCOONS: I think it is critical that folks in this country be able to stand up to and take on powerful interests. And where individuals are harmed, that they\u2019re able to go into court and to seek redress, whether they\u2019re harmed by someone who misled them in a securities investment, a product that they purchased that hurt them because it wasn\u2019t designed or delivered right, or a medical procedure that went horribly wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t support putting caps on liability because I frankly think in our current system it is only the threat of a significant recovery that allows protection for consumers, for patients, for investors. I, frankly, think that\u2019s an important part of the American legal system.\n\nI do think, as I just mentioned, there are significant advances in this bill that allow us to make health care safer, stronger, more transparent. And if I\u2019ve got a major concern about this bill, it\u2019s that we\u2019re going to reduce costs without squelching innovation.\n\nDelaware and this country has made incredible advances\u2026\n\nKARIBJANIAN: It is discussion.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: It is discussion. OK. That\u2019s what I was trying to -- OK.\n\nFirst of all, you say that you\u2019re concerned about reducing costs, but reports have showed that this health care bill has caused costs to skyrocket.\n\nSecond of all, you say that it\u2026\n\nCOONS: I don\u2019t know what reports you\u2019re reading. I haven\u2019t seen reports that document that.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: \u2026 partisan bickering, but one out of four Democrats have gone on record saying that they oppose \u2018Obama-care,\u2019 they\u2019ve realized that we made a bad mistake, and what this bill does is it gives a massive\u2026\n\nCOONS: And three out of four Democrats strongly support it.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: \u2026 control over health care.\n\nCOONS: It does not give massive control\u2026\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Uncle Sam has no business coming in the examination room.\n\nCOONS: \u2026 to Uncle Sam over health care.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Coming between you and your doctor. And that\u2019s exactly what this bill does.\n\nCOONS: Christine, give some concrete example of how -- that\u2019s a great slogan. You toss it around everywhere you go. How does this bill actually put Uncle Sam in the examination room between doctors and patients?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: It dictates what kind of\u2026\n\nCOONS: And if so, why did the organization that fights for and represents America\u2019s nurses, America\u2019s seniors, America\u2019s hospitals, and America\u2019s doctors, all endorse and support this bill?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And many of those branches on the state level, including here in Delaware, have said we don\u2019t support what the national office has done.\n\nIt gives the government the ability to say\u2026\n\nCOONS: That\u2019s not true.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: \u2026 what kind of treatment a doctor can and can\u2019t do, what kind it will fund. It forces businesses to have to comply to these standards where many businesses, especially here in Delaware, have said that they can\u2019t afford to, and it\u2019s cheaper to pay the non-compliance.\n\nCOONS: Well, Ms. O\u2019Donnell, the state Chamber of Commerce\u2026\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And it has also cut -- this health care bill has cut Medicare.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s get this point out because we\u2019re down into the last 30 seconds of this discussion.\n\nCOONS: I was just going to say, the state Chamber of Commerce and Christiana Care hosted a debate earlier today. I was sorry you chose not to join us. It would have been great to hear the response of the physicians and the nurses and the hospital administrators to your suggesting that they didn\u2019t support a bill they lobbied for.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLITZER: I want to be precise on this specific health care-related issue. You oppose the government mandating that everyone must purchase health insurance, is that right?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Yes, because we\u2019re confusing coverage with care. Our goal needs to be to make health care affordable.\n\nBLITZER: All right. Well, here\u2019s the question. Let\u2019s say someone decides not to purchase health insurance, makes that conscientious decision, even though this person can afford to buy health insurance, but decided he doesn\u2019t want to. This person gets critically ill, is rushed to an emergency room.\n\nShould we, people who pay for health insurance, provide him or her with that kind of treatment, or should we kick them out of the emergency room, said, you made a decision, you\u2019re not going to get this kind of treatment?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: If we do the things that I\u2019ve said that will help to address\n\n-- that I\u2019m proposing, that will help to address the issue of health care, then that person can afford to buy a catastrophic-only policy from across state lines. They\u2019ll be able\u2026\n\nBLITZER: Well, what if the person doesn\u2019t want to buy it?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, then we have to address that.\n\nBLITZER: Who should take care of that person in an emergency?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: We have to address it.\n\nBLITZER: Would we, all of us tax-payers\u2026\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: We have to -- no, we have to\u2026\n\nBLITZER: \u2026 have to pay for that person?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Anything that they do when they have another bill that they can\u2019t pay, make them pay it. Hold them accountable for that.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Before or after they get care?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: But right now, right now -- well, that\u2019s up to the hospital.\n\nBut right now we\u2019re forcing them to. We\u2019re forcing them that they have to give care to illegal aliens.\n\nSo this is something that we\u2019re already doing. What I\u2019m proposing, you\u2019re also talking about a very small hypothetical using scare tactics to make people support this health care bill.\n\nWhat I\u2019m proposing in the health care reforms that I\u2019m proposing will help address those situation and help alleviate those situations.\n\nBLITZER: Not just a small number...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, nobody should be forced to pay for anyone else\u2019s health care, and that\u2019s what Obamacare is doing.\n\nCOONS: And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. Before the health care reform bill passed, all of us who have health insurance, who have health coverage have been bearing the costs, paying the freight for those who don\u2019t have insurance and don\u2019t have coverage. They\u2019re getting health care through emergency rooms now. That\u2019s partly why small businesses, employers like New Castle County have faced double digit increases in our insurance costs year after year and year because that\u2019s how we provide care now, it\u2019s inefficient, it\u2019s inhumane and it\u2019s not effective.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We have to (inaudible) this issue for now and move on to our next topic.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: ...agree with me that Obamacare should be...\n\nBLITZER: Let\u2019s move on to immigration right now. And this question will be for Mr. Coons. A pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, you support that, right?\n\nCOONS: No. I support a pathway to being here legally. And let me take a moment \u2013 was that your whole question?\n\nBLITZER: The question is, what is your position on a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants?\n\nCOONS: We\u2019ve got roughly 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States today. This is a huge problem. And immigration is a federal responsibility. And I think we should look to the federal government to step up and fix it.\n\nThe federal government has failed states like Arizona, like Delaware, like many others. But we need to recognize the situation we\u2019re in. There are whole industries that rely on the labor of those who are here illegally. And there is a long tradition of failing to deliver the border security that our country needs. The current administration has stepped up and invested millions of dollars in additional troops and additional services, additional support at the border.\n\nMy path forward on immigration would be, strengthen the borders. Make it much tougher for folks to come here illegally and increase the penalties when they do.\n\nSecond, hold employers accountable, particularly those who routinely employ folks who are here illegally by giving them Real ID that can work, that is much more difficult to counterfeit and then holding them accountable if they repeatedly violate that by employing those who are here illegally.\n\nAnd then allow those who are here illegally and do not commit further crimes to come out of the shadows if they will pay taxes, learn English, pay a fine, say I committed a crime and pay a fine and go to the back of the line behind those who applied to come here legally. I would give them a path towards legal residence. I think there\u2019s more they\u2019d have to do to ever earn citizenship.\n\nI respect the tradition of those who go and serve our nation overseas, for example, being offered a chance at citizenship. But in my view, the pathway I\u2019m suggesting is one towards legal residence.\n\nI want to see us focus our resources, law enforcement resources on finding and deporting those who pose a real threat to our community. As somehow responsible for a county police department, I\u2019ve seen over and over instances where neighborhoods are threatened by people who are here illegally and where the ICE does not have the resources to deport them when we deliver them to them. That should be our top priority.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Again, he\u2019s back tracking on things that he had said earlier on the campaign trail. And I would ask you when you say that you support border enforcement, this administration recently stopped the efforts to put a virtual fence on our border. When Barack Obama is standing with you on a campaign trail this Friday, are you going to tell him that you disagree with him on his immigration reform efforts?\n\nI believe, however, that securing our borders should be our first priority before we get into any discussion of whether we\u2019re going to get Social Security benefits to illegal aliens. America is a magnet for those all over the country who do believe \u2013 or all over the world, who do believe that America does stand as a beacon of hope and justice for the world, and therefore, I support a legal pathway to those who are coming over here, especially for political asylum, to seek a better life than they do in our country. And to reward those who break our laws is to cheat those who honor them. And this is not a message that our federal government should be sending.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s go into the discussion portion of it. Because you say that you agreed to the pathway to citizenship...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: For legal.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: But you don\u2019t want to provide amnesty.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I don\u2019t want to provide amnesty...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: How can you do one without the other?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Because what I\u2019m saying is we have to get rid of all the bureaucratic messes that make the legal pathway difficult. But when someone willingly breaks our laws, that sends a message that \u2013 don\u2019t worry about the laws that we\u2019ve set up, don\u2019t worry about those who are on long waiting lists for political asylum, break our laws and we\u2019ll grant you these benefits. It\u2019s sending the wrong message. It\u2019s economically hurting us. And it\u2019s also a national security issue.\n\nCOONS: Ms. O\u2019Donnell patently mischaracterizes her own position.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I do support responsible guest worker programs. And that\u2019s the difference.\n\nCOONS: If you can reconcile all those comments, you\u2019re an even more talented reporter than I think you are Nancy.\n\nOne of the challenges we face is getting past the endless bickering and the partisan divide on this. Senator John McCain was someone who, before this election cycle, had been a real advocate for working with the business community, working with Democrats in Congress to find a path forward. As the years and years have rolled by, the number of folks who are here illegally and who pose real threats to our community continue to grow and we are not taking the actions we need to take to separate those who are willing to pay a fine, to accept responsibility for coming here illegally and begin paying taxes and contributing to our community and the benefits they are earning.\n\nI would rather have us begin to provide a path so that those who are here illegally all stand up and take responsibility for that or are deported. That way we can make progress.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Wow, he just took a hard-line position. Again, I would ask you, are you going to tell President Obama that, that you disagree with him and you think that illegal aliens should be deported.\n\nBut we have to keep in mind that when we tried amnesty in the 80\u2019s it back-fired. It only increased the problem. So we\u2019ve got to address the issue of securing our borders. And this is something the President Obama\u2019s administration stopped this year.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to secure our borders first and then begin the discussion on guest worker programs and how to eliminate some of the bureaucracies that keep the legal pathway to citizenship so difficult.\n\nBLITZER: We\u2019re going to get to student questions in a moment. We\u2019re going to get to another question that I have. But I just want to clarify one thing on the national security front, on China, which is a huge issue right now. In 2006, and correct if I\u2019m wrong, you said that China has, quote, \u2018a carefully thought out and strategic plan to take over America. And if they pretend to be our friend, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve got something up their sleeve.\u2019 You also said, \u2018you wish you weren\u2019t privy to some of the classified information I am privy to.\u2019\n\nI\u2019d like, if possible, for you to clarify what you meant.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, first of all, I was talking about when I was working with the humanitarian group that was going to China. We are given some security briefs about China\u2019s position with some potentially hostile nations and some security threats that my clients would be facing.\n\nBut we do have to look at China, because we own \u2013 they own so much of our debt, it prohibits a lot of decisions that we need to make in regard to our foreign policy. Number one is Iran with nuclear weapons. China stands in a big way there. These gasoline sanctions that we have are not enforced as strictly as they could be, because have allies like France and Italy participating in the gasoline embargo, but then China comes in and swoops all that business.\n\nWe need to be putting sanctions on those Chinese companies, because right now when it comes \u2013 Iran getting nuclear weapons is our biggest threat to our national security. And when we go to China and we say, please stop these companies, they probably smirk, because we\u2019re not economically in a position to really hold them to that. China could be a bigger ally with us in North Korea, but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not putting the pressure on North Korea that they could.\n\nSo first of all, we have got to tackle that national debt.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to stop these things like these reckless spending bills coming from Washington that only contribute to further our national debt, because it is putting our national security at issue.\n\nBLITZER: But on a specific quote that you said that China has a plan to take over America, you know about this plan?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, they misquoted me at the time, I believe. But look at what\u2019s going on. Right now, monetarily, China could take us up over monetarily before they could militarily.\n\nBLITZER: You want to quickly respond, because I know that we want to get to the students\u2019 questions?\n\nCOONS: It\u2019s hard for me to respond effectively, Wolf, to all the different issues that my opponent has raised in previous statements, and I\u2019ll just let that stand.\n\nI don\u2019t have any classified information about China or its plans, but what I think we really need to focus on in this debate, on this particular question, is the steady degradation of our security posture in the Pacific Rim. The Australian navy engaged in joint exercises with the Chinese and specifically excluded us recently. A dramatic shift in\n\nthe Australian policy. And as the Chinese have become economically stronger, they are seeking to become militarily stronger. They\u2019re pushing the envelope on issues from Taiwan to trade to intellectual\n\nproperty. It is a profound threat, not just to the vitality of our economy and our innovation and our manufacturing businesses, but also to our safety and security, to have widespread counterfeiting of everything\n\nfrom pharmaceuticals to aircraft parts, to garments, going on in China without our standing up and fighting against it...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: (inaudible) out of time.\n\nCOONS: ... in trade war... (CROSSTALK)\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We\u2019re out of time at this point...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Are you saying that China has a plot to take over America?\n\nKARIBJANIAN: We\u2019re going to close out this conversation and move on to the students\u2019 questions because we do want to involve the University of Delaware students. And first up, we have a question from a student who brings us the issue of don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was wondering if you\u2019re planning to (inaudible) the issue of don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell and its possible repeal.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Mr. Coons, your response? One minute.\n\nCOONS: I would move swiftly as a senator to repeal don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. I think it is discrimination, plain and simple. I\u2019ve met with and spoken to veterans here in Delaware who\u2019ve served our nation honorably for decades, several with top-secret clearances, but who could do so only at the expense of denying who they were and the relationships\n\nthat they wanted to have. In my view, we should be making progress in this country towards recognizing the full range of humane experience, and repealing don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell to me is an important next step in the civil rights movement.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: A federal judge recently ruled that we had to overturn don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. There are a couple of things we need to say about that. First of all, judges should not be legislating from the bench. Second of all, it\u2019s up to the military to set the policy that the military believes is in the best interests of unit cohesiveness and military readiness.\n\nThe military already regulates personal behavior in that it does not allow affairs to go on within your - your chain of command. It doesn\u2019t allow, if you\u2019re married, to have an adulterous affair within the military. So the military already regulates personal behavior because it feels that it is in the best interests of our military readiness.\n\nI don\u2019t think that Congress should be forcing a social agenda onto our military. I think we should leave that to the military to decide.\n\nBLITZER: We have another student question on the issue of embryonic stem cell research, and this goes first to Mr. Coons.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My question is, what are your views on the federal allocation of funds used for stem cell research?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOONS: I would support stem cell research, and I think...\n\nBLITZER: We\u2019re talking about embryonic stem cell research.\n\nCOONS: Correct. I would support federal funding for medical research that includes embryonic stem cell research. I think there are critical advances that are being made and can be made in addressing some of the most difficult diseases that affect millions of Americans, and I frankly think if it is possible to do so, we ought to be investing and making progress in this critical area of research.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I think if we took an intellectually honest look at the research that\u2019s been put out there, you will see that there is incredible advances with adult stem cell research, not as much with embryonic stem cell research, because that is where this went on in the private sector. That is where investors would be putting their money.\n\nSecond of all, the government, the federal government, should not be in the business of creating life, simply to destroy it. And when it comes to the issue of so-called medical waste, I would point to a program called the Snowflake Babies, where they have had incredible success adopting these human embryos that are going to be discarded for medical\n\nwaste. Where they have given millions-oh, I\u2019m sorry-hundreds and potentially thousands of infertile couples the opportunity to have babies. It is the Snowflake program, it is a wonderful program and I suggest everyone take a look at it.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Our next student question brings us the issue of abortion.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is your stance on abortion, including in cases of rape and incest.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLITZER: For you.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I believe there has been a profound loss of respect for the dignity of human life, and that is reflected in a lot of our policies, whether it is cutting taxes exemptions for disabled, low-income citizens in New Castle County, or with abortion. I respect the human dignity on all levels, the unrepeatable precious human dignity on all levels. And my opponent and others will use the scare tactic about rape and incest when that is less than 1 percent of all abortions\n\nperformed in America.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Mr. Coons?\n\nCOONS: I strongly support a woman\u2019s right to choose. It is settled constitutional law. It is an important part of our nation and its freedoms. I personally am opposed to abortion. But I don\u2019t think it is my place to put that view on women. I think abortion should be safe, legal and rare.\n\nBLITZER: Let\u2019s get into some of these issues and then we\u2019ll go back and get some more students questions. On the issue of gays serving openly in the United States military? Almost all of the NATO allies allow gays to serve openly in the military. Israel, which has a fine military, as you know, allows gays to serve openly in the military. Why specifically do you believe gays should not be allowed to serve openly in our military?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Because it is a military policy that our military set forth. It is the same thing as I said in my remarks, about adultery not being allowed in the military. It is a military policy that they regulate, because they believe that is in the best interest of unit cohesiveness and our effective military.\n\nBLITZER: So if the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says he believes gays should be allowed to serve-\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: If all four-\n\nBLITZER: -in the military. Would that be good enough for you?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: If all four heads, if the heads of all four branches of the military said that, then it would be up to them, not me, as a U.S. senator to impose my social agenda, whether it is for or against \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019.\n\nBLITZER: Well, what about that? What if the chairman of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, their respective chairman said, you know what, we\u2019ll do whatever the commander in chief tells us to do, but we don\u2019t think it is a good idea because of these issues, that Ms. O\u2019Donnell raises, unit cohesion and those other issues. What\n\nwould you say then?\n\nCOONS: One of my real heroes is Harry Truman. Harry Truman made a very difficult decision, to compel the racial integration of the United States armed forces, at a point when most of the leaders, most of the generals said, for exactly the same sorts of reason, unit cohesion, performance in the battlefield. We should not have a racially integrated military. That was a brave decision. It was an important decision. And the ultimate long-term impact has made our United States military one of the most progressive, in terms of promotion and advancement opportunities for racial minorities of any organization in our country.\n\nAs you said earlier, most of our NATO allies have long ago realized that we are giving up on the service of thousands of potential volunteers who could be serving our nation at home and abroad. I don\u2019t think it makes any sense, because of a narrow social agenda, to continue to exclude them from open service in our military.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Mr. Coons-\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Our next student question- We\u2019re going to-we don\u2019t-we\u2019re not necessarily going to open discussion on that right now, because we want to get the student questions in. Our next student question comes on the issue of campaign finance reform.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is your position on campaign finance reform? And what is your reaction to the recent Supreme Court ruling allowing corporations to donate to political campaigns?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Mr. Coons, you are first, one minute.\n\nCOONS: I think the Citizens United decision, the decision to which the student is referring, was an unfortunate and ill-decided decision. One that opens the flood gates to increased corporate contributions that could have the unintended consequence-I think, unintended of the decision-of significantly distorting out electoral process here in the\n\nUnited States.\n\nAnd I would support reforms that further disclose who is behind these shadowy groups? Whether individuals, or corporations, that are trying to influence our elections by pouring money into it. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. And in politics it is best for us to disclose as fully and as broadly as possible who is making contributions.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And yet the legislative efforts to do exactly that has failed to do that. The Disclose Act, that you know, Harry Reid-which he\u2019s called my opponent his pet-has put out there to do just that, has exempt the major corporations from disclosing it. Instead, what these efforts do is only serve to infringe on the First Amendment right of private citizens.\n\nI\u2019ll use my own campaign as an example. From our FEC reports, my supporters have been getting harassing phone calls, not just from reporters, but from all kinds of people who oppose my candidacy. They are using intimidation tactics because we are forced to disclose who is contributing to my campaign. So, this so-called campaign finance reform\n\nis exempting the corporations whether on the left or the right. It is those who are in Washington already, those who are over 10 years old, who have over a half a million members, and who already are playing in the backroom deals. So this is a misguided attempt.\n\nBLITZER: Do the American people have a right to know where all this money, in these campaigns is coming from?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Yes and no. I believe that there are ways to do that where we can report to the FEC. But we don\u2019t have to make them public unless there is a question of corruption. And then that would prevent a lot of the harassment that my supporters are getting.\n\nThat would prevent a lot of the discussion about our First Amendment rights. We can disclose that to the FEC, but they don\u2019t have to put it up on a Web site that makes anyone vulnerable to further fundraising calls.\n\nI mean, over and over, that is a repeated violation in many campaigns, not my own. But even my own party has said go look on someone\u2019s FEC report and call them up for a donation. And I\u2019ve said, absolutely not. That is against the law.\n\nBLITZER: Very quickly.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: So these so-called disclosure attempts are being abused.\n\nCOONS: I just-there is so much there, Wolf. I don\u2019t know. Frankly, I support full disclosure of campaign contributions. As I said before, I think it is the best way to ensure that we have got fair, open and clean campaigns. Folks should know who the folks are who are contributing to campaigns. It is an important way to hold candidates and elected officials accountable.\n\nBLITZER: We have another student question on the sensitive issue of religion in America.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In light of the events in the past decade, Islam has been viewed as a religion for extremists and terrorists, where Muslims, including myself, can attest that Islam is far from that. Now recently there has been much controversy over the mosque being built in the vicinity of ground zero and also the Florida pastor making outrageous remarks about the Koran. Now my question to you is, as senator, where is the line between the freedom of speech and the respect of other religions? Both of which freedoms are found in the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Coons.\n\nCOONS: That\u2019s a great question-and a difficult one. The Florida pastor who caused a lot of outrage by threatening to burn the Koran showed a profound misunderstand of the difference between the Islamic terrorists, the extremists who genuinely attack America, and, I think, deserve our condemnation and the vast majority of Muslims who participate in a religion whose fundamental principle is a commitment to peace and embracing the rest of humanity. If that Florida pastor wanted to make the right point, he should have threatened to burn the readings and the teachings of Osama bin Laden, or of other folks who are a part of the Islamist extremist groups.\n\nIt is an important challenge, a key role of the United States Supreme Court to continue to draw the line in the First Amendment between those who would do the equivalent of calling fire in a crowded theater, who would be inciting to attack and riot, such as Osama bin Laden has in some extremist and hateful writings, and those who have scripture, religious traditions that are deserving and worthy of broad support.\n\nThose are difficult lines to police. And that\u2019s a central role that the Supreme Court plays in our democracy.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, I would agree. The Supreme Court has said that there are restrictions on our First Amendment rights. Again, you know, you can\u2019t, as you said, go into a crowded theater and yell fire. You can\u2019t stand up on a plane and yell hijack. You can\u2019t slander and libel someone.\n\nHowever, where the question has come between what is protected free speech and what is not protected free speech, the Supreme Court has always ruled that the community, the local community has the right to decide.\n\nAnd then the issue with the \u20189\/11 mosque,\u2019 that\u2019s exactly where the battle is being fought, by the community members who are impacted by that. And I support that.\n\nBLITZER: But the community members have -- at least the city council, the mayor, and the representatives -- the elected\n\nrepresentatives support this mosque and community center that is supposed to be built near 9\/11.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: And a lot of the people on the ground do not. And they\u2019re going to have a lot to face from their constituents and maybe their re-election is even going to be jeopardized.\n\nBLITZER: Should this cultural center and mosque near 9\/11 be built?\n\nCOONS: There is already cultural centers -- there is already mosques in many locations in Manhattan, and as you mentioned. I would defer to the decision of the local land use authorities, the folks who were elected by that community, to make decisions about where, when, and how things ought to be built.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was a wise choice of location. But I can\u2019t stand here and say that we should prevent folks from practicing their religion anywhere in the United States. To say that we will say, you can\u2019t build a mosque here, violates one of our most fundamental principles, freedom of religion.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Well, we\u2019ve talked about the Supreme Court, and obviously a United States senator has the opportunity to determine in a way the make-up of that court. So what opinions of late that have come from our high court do you most object to?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Oh, gosh. Give me a specific one, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Actually, I can\u2019t, because I need you to tell me which ones you object to.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I\u2019m very sorry. Right off the top of my head, I know that there are a lot, but I\u2019ll put it up on my Web site, I promise you.\n\nBLITZER: Well, we know you disagree with Roe versus Wade.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Yes, but that was -- she said a recent one.\n\nBLITZER: Well, that\u2019s relatively recent.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: She said, of late. Yes, well, Roe versus Wade would not put the power -- sorry, it\u2019s 30 (ph)...(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLITZER: But since then, have there been any other...(LAUGHTER)\n\nBLITZER: ... Supreme Court decisions?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, let me say, about Roe versus Wade, Roe versus Wade, if that were overturned, would not make abortion illegal in the United States, it would put the power back to the states.\n\nBLITZER: But besides that decision, anything else you disagree with?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Oh, there are several, when it comes to pornography,\n\nwhen it comes to court decisions, not just Supreme Court, but federal\n\ncourt decisions to give terrorists Miranda-ized rights.\n\nI mean, there are a lot of things that I believe that -- this California decision to overturn \u2018Don\u2019t Ask\/Don\u2019t Tell,\u2019 I believe that there are a lot of federal judges who are legislating from the bench.\n\nBLITZER: That wasn\u2019t the Supreme Court, it\u2019s a lower court.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: That was a federal judge -- that\u2019s what I said, in\n\nCalifornia.\n\nBLITZER: But which Supreme Court decisions, if any, do you disagree with?\n\nCOONS: The most recent one that I\u2019ve been engaged in we\u2019ve talked about, is Citizens United. I think the Citizens United case takes a sort of logical extension in the law, but takes it to a ridiculous extreme.\n\nCorporations really aren\u2019t entitled to the same free speech rights, in my view, as people. And in Delaware, America\u2019s corporate capital, you would think we would be fighting for the rights of corporations.\n\nBut in terms of political contributions, the free speech rights of corporations, I don\u2019t think deserve the same protections as the free speech rights of real living, breathing, voting humans.\n\nAnd so I would disagree with that decision. And I would act to try and find ways to limit it, narrow it, or even overturn it.\n\nBLITZER: Anything else?\n\nCOONS: That\u2019s the most important.\n\nBLITZER: Let\u2019s take another question from a student on energy, right now.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My question is, where do you think funding should be placed in order to move toward the United States decreasing its carbon program.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Coons.\n\nCOONS: Well, the most effective investment in reducing emissions of CO2 and other things that cause greenhouse gas warming is energy efficiency and conservation. There was a significant investment in the stimulus bill in getting municipalities, local governments, the private sector, to invest in efficiency and conservation. And those are\n\ninvestments that reduce emissions, put people to work, and can develop cutting edge technologies that make our systems operate better and to reduce, not just the emissions, but also the operating expenses.\n\nIn New Castle County, we took $3.8 million in EECBG grants and combined it with $4 million of our own and retrofit 20 county buildings. We reduced our operating costs, we reduced our emissions and we ultimately put folks to work here in our own community.\n\nAs you look at those kinds of investments around the country. They\u2019re the most important -- they have the most impact of anything you can do that will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There\u2019s many more things we need to do to improve the efficiency of operation...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOONS: ...of coal fire power plants. Excuse me.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, I think the best way to address this that is most relevant to this U.S. Senate race is to talk about the issue of Cap and Trade because the winner of this U.S. Senate race can be immediately sworn in and serve it in Harry Reid\u2019s lame duck session and vote on Cap and Trade. While I do believe that we have to be good stewards of this\n\nearth, we don\u2019t need to do it at the expense of our citizens and Cap and Trade will do that, whether it\u2019s farmers, senior citizens, or realtors who are concerned about its green compliance standards. Nobody wants this bill. This bill is a national energy tax that will ration energy use and increase our utility bills. Senior citizens are concerned about\n\nthe cost these new utility bills going up. Farmers are concerned about the green compliance standards and raised utility bills shutting down their operations. And realtors are concerned about the green compliance standards hurting and already hurting housing market.\n\nBut I would have to ask my opponent, speaking of Cap and Trade, your family business stands to financially benefit from some environmental legislation under Bush...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: The minute\u2019s up, so let\u2019s talk...(CROSSTALK)\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Would your business...\n\nCOONS: A fascinating question that really makes no sense, yet, so\n\nif you\u2019d like to -- better ask the whole question, I\u2019d be...(CROSSTALK)\n\nWhat\u2019s she talking about?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: I\u2019d like to know if your family business stands to have a financial gain if Cap and Trade is passed and if so, would you recuse yourself in the lame duck sessions from voting with Harry Reid?\n\nCOONS: Fascinating question. No, to the best of my knowledge there is no direct financial benefit. And I do think it\u2019s important for folks in public office to conduct themselves ethically, to be transparent and to be accountable for decisions they make and for votes that they cast.\n\nI am someone who thinks that greenhouse gasses are a concern, are a problem for the long-term. And I think we need to take steps to rein them in and to deal with the environmental consequences that they might present.\n\nBLITZER: Well, let me ask Miss O\u2019Donnell what evidence do you have that any family business that he has would stand to gain from Cap and Trade?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Because they make fuel cells and...\n\nBLITZER: Who\u2019s they?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: W.L. Gore. They make some of the stuff that will be required by these business to regulate Cap and Trade, so...\n\nBLITZER: Is that true?\n\nCOONS: That\u2019s quite a stretch. Gore makes over 1,000 products. It was difficult for me to understand, from her question what she was alking about. Gore is a company that makes lots and lots of products from implantable medical devices to dental floss to some membranes that component parts that go into systems that go into fuel cells.\n\nFuel cells are not currently fielded broadly in the United States. It\u2019s a cutting-edge technology that some day has the promise of being a significant contributor to making a more energy-efficient, cleaner transportation future. But to me, the impact is so distant from any particular proposal on cap-and-trade, it took a couple of minutes to even understand what she was talking about.\n\nBLITZER: On this issue of energy, let\u2019s just wrap up this section with this. Yesterday, the Obama administration announced it was lifting the moratorium in deep-water oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Do you support this kind of offshore oil drilling?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, that has raised the issue of whether or not we support it here in Delaware, because that move by Obama would allow that. No, I don\u2019t want to see oil rigs off the state of Delaware.\n\nHowever, it should be up to the states to decide. And if Governor Markell and our state legislatures in Dover were to pass legislation for that, then I shouldn\u2019t as a congressman overstep a state\u2019s right. If Virginia wants it -- not only that. We have got to begin to wean ourselves off of foreign oil. We are dependent on potentially hostile countries like Russia and Venezuela, while our own homeland is rich with natural resources, whether it\u2019s oil or natural gas, and there are states\n\nthat do want to begin exploration. Alaska, Virginia. We as a government need to support those states who do want it.\n\nBLITZER: Do you agree or disagree?\n\nCOONS: I opposed the president\u2019s proposal to open the outer continental shelf off of Delaware to oil drilling when it was first made months ago. I frankly think that Delaware\u2019s world-class beaches shouldn\u2019t be at risk of being spoiled by oil spills. We depend on tourism, on our fisheries. There\u2019s lots of reasons. I think it just doesn\u2019t make sense, for most of the Atlantic coast.\n\nI do think there are natural energy resources in this country we can and should begin to exploit more fully, but I would also prioritize investments in alternative energy technologies.\n\nThe University of Delaware has long been a world leader in solar power, for example, and has a key role to play in making wind power real. Offshore wind power, solar power. These are the sorts of initiatives (ph) where I\u2019d prefer to see federal investment and new innovative opportunities that could create good jobs for the long term.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: Let\u2019s leave time to throw in one more issue here before we go to closing statements. We are kind of drawing down on time.\n\nThis is an issue that I think can really illustrate the differences perhaps between the two of you, and that is what specifically would you and could you do to actually help end any of the bitter partisan -- bipartisan -- non-partisanship in Washington? So what would you be able to do as an individual once you arrive in Washington?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, I\u2019ve had to fight my party to be here on this stage to win the nomination, and to some extent I am still fighting my party. So my -- when I go to Washington, my allegiance will be to the voters of Delaware, not any special interests.\n\nMy whole campaign has been about returning the political process back to the people of Delaware, and to me that\u2019s a great thing. So what I would do is I would stand strong on legislation that benefits the interest of our citizens, not the special interests in Washington, D.C., and I would stand there and not just vote against a piece of legislation, but make the floor speeches that would try to convince my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who\u2019ve lost their way and given\n\ninto partisanship so much that it has caused several stalemates, as to why this is in the best interests of their constituents. And I would stand firm regardless of what kind of pressure was on, from either party, to stand firm in doing what is right for the people of Delaware, not the interests in Washington.\n\nCOONS: I frankly don\u2019t think my opponent can or has pointed to one single example where she supports the current administration or an initiative of the Democratic Party. I have a real, practical record of having reached bipartisan solutions here in county government, of working with the elected Republicans who\u2019ve served with me on county\n\ncouncil and on council while I\u2019ve been county executive. I\u2019ve got a real, hands-on record here in the private sector and in my service and partnership with the private sector of reaching out to folks from different political backgrounds, from different experiences, and from different worldviews, to work with them to find solutions.\n\nI think that\u2019s the kind of record that Delawareans will look at in judging whether or not I\u2019ve got the capacity to address some of this endless partisan bickering.\n\nBLITZER: Well, on this specific issue, and Ms. O\u2019Donnell raised it earlier, I\u2019ll give you a chance to clarify, to explain, she says that Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, has called you his \u2018pet.\u2019\n\nCOONS: I don\u2019t know why Harry Reid said that. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s pet. I\u2019m going to be a bulldog for Delaware. I\u2019m running to represent all Delawareans, of whatever party, not just the Democrats. And I\u2019ve got a significant amount of support from independents, from Republicans, from Democrats, from all three counties.\n\nI\u2019ve got a record of independence and of fighting for the public interest as county executive, and I would continue that in Washington.\n\nBLITZER: And just to clarify another point...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Well, then why...\n\nBLITZER: ... from earlier, just to make sure we tie this up, earlier you said you didn\u2019t want to have to talk about comments you made years ago about witchcraft and stuff like that. But in this commercial that\u2019s so widely seen, you begin the commercial with the words \u2018I am not a witch.\u2019 What were you thinking...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Put it to rest.\n\nBLITZER: What were you thinking?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: To put it to rest. To put it behind me.\n\nBLITZER: But didn\u2019t you realize if you do that in a commercial, it would just revive it and everybody would be talking about that?\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: No. We\u2019re moving past that and we\u2019re talking about the issues. I\u2019d like to address what my opponent just said about being a bulldog for Delaware, yet in a fund-raising letter he promises to support the \u2018Reid-Obama-Pelosi agenda\u2019 lockstep and barrel (sic). That\u2019s not non-partisanship.\n\nAnd again, why are the -- why is the Democratic Party pulling out all of the stops to get him elected? Because they see him as a rubber stamp for their agenda. And there are many things that I have publicly said that I support the Obama administration on.\n\nI support Obama\u2019s decision to send troops to Afghanistan. I support Obama\u2019s decision for drones. I support Obama\u2019s decision to treat the American who is recruiting terrorists on American soil, who is hiding in Yemen, I support the decision for our intelligence agencies to do whatever it takes to take him out.\n\nSo there are things that I would proudly support, when it is in the best interest of Delawareans. But I believe that a lot of the policies coming from this administration are not in the best interest of Delawareans, and most of them are the failed stimulus bills where we\u2019ve been promised one thing and then received another.\n\nBut breaking promises is something that my opponent is very comfortable doing.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: But even local party leaders have questioned you candidacy, especially after the primary. And you criticized the man you beat in that primary for being someone who went with what he felt was in the best interests of Delawareans, for being someone who was borrowing Republican principles but going with the Democrats. So how can you rationalize...\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: What I did in the Republican primary, and what I will continue to do is bust up the backroom deals. We have -- a lot of our leaders have an obnoxious sense of entitlement about who should get in office and who should represent them on the ballot.\n\nKARIBJANIAN: OK.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: What my campaign did is put the...\n\nKARIBJANIAN: I need to interrupt just because we have to get to the closing statements.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Ah, OK.\n\nBLITZER: All right. Let\u2019s -- and we will begin the closing statements, both of you will have a chance to make your final comments. We\u2019ll begin with Ms. O\u2019Donnell.\n\nO\u2019DONNELL: Thank you. Once again, I\u2019d like to thank the host of\n\nthis debate and Nancy and Wolf.\n\nAnd I hope now that the Delaware voters better understand the clear choice we face in November. My opponent has a record of raising taxes and a record of wasting -- wasteful spending.\n\nLike so many career politicians, he says he would do one thing and then only breaks his promises after he has assumed office. My opponent will rubber stamp the same failed policies that have caused unemployment and our national debt to skyrocket.\n\nHe is in lockstep with Barack Obama and Harry Reid. And that\u2019s why Harry Reid has called him his \u2018pet.\u2019 I\u2019m not a Democrat, but I know that what is happening in this country right now is not what my Democratic friends voted for when they voted for change in 2008.\n\nWhat Washington needs now are new voices and new ideas that look to the people and not to the government for the solutions to our economic problems.\n\nMy opponent is addicted to a culture of spending, waste, fraud and abuse, whether it\u2019s spending tax dollars on men\u2019s fashion shows, or to pay off his cronies with sweetheart pension deals and special interests. We already have enough politicians in Washington like that.\n\nI want to go to Washington and be the voice of the people of Delaware, not any party of special interest group. I want to go to Washington and represent the people who put me on the stage tonight and who are willing to work hard to get our country back on track again. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but I do believe that America is the greatest force of good in the world, and I had never questioned whether America is a beacon of freedom and justice.\n\nWe will get our financial house in order. We will cut spending. We will reform our government, and we will defeat our enemies and see triumph of (ph) our (ph) freedom again.\n\nSo with that said, I hope that you will support me and cast your vote for O\u2019Donnell for U.S. Senate. God bless you and God bless Delaware.\n\nCOONS: I appreciate your attention to tonight\u2019s debate. Thank you for the tough questions you\u2019ve asked and for the open and good conversation we\u2019ve had over the last 90 minutes. I think you\u2019ve heard, there is a real and clear difference between our opponent and me, in our values, our experience, and in our ",

    "text":"On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others.\n\n\"There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe,\" Hannity said.\n\n\"Now, this is a terrorist act,\" Hannity said. \"What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?\"\n\n\n\n\"Here's the point,\" Hannity said, \"Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.\"\n\nWe've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the \"global war on terrorism\" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out.\n\nWe did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase \"war on terrorism\" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase \"war on terror,\" but only a couple of times.\n\nSo what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question.\n\nThe first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase \"war on terror\" and \"frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.\"\n\n\n\nObama: \"I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.\n\n\n\n\"And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.\n\n\n\n\"But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.\"\n\nThe issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:\n\nCooper: \"I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?\"\n\nObama: \"Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.\"\n\nCooper: \"So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?\"\n\nObama: \"You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.\"\n\nSo Obama isn't fond of the phrase \"war on terror.\" But did that ever become blanket White House policy?\n\nAccording to a Washington Post story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said \"this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or \"Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' \" According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials.\n\nKenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the Washington Post there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of \"a career civil servant.\"\n\nStill, you don't hear administration officials using the term \"war on terror,\" or the like, very often.\n\nObama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words \"terror\" or \"terrorism\" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world.\n\nThe absence of those words \"goes to the heart\" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. 6, 2009.\n\n\"As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9\/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaida\u2019s murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat.\"\n\nBrennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. \"President Obama has articulated a clear policy \u2014 to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies,\" Brennan said. \"That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.\"\n\nOur aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the \"war on terror.\" Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term \"war on terrorism.\" And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase \"war on terror,\" Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase \"war on terrorism.\" And so we rate Hannity's statement True.",

    "text":"DONALD TRUMP, the President of the United States, along with Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, sat down for a conversation with editors from The Economist on May 4th, 2017. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nThe Economist: Could we start with the economy?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nWhat is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?\n\nWell it\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? It\u2019s very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said I\u2019m going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, he\u2019s not a free-trader\u201d, which I am, I\u2019m absolutely a free-trader. I\u2019m for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe\u2019s not a free-trader,\u201d at 10%. But if I say we\u2019re putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. It\u2019s really sort of an amazing thing.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where I\u2019m not sure that we have any good trade deals. I don\u2019t know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But we\u2019re not going to lose any more. And so it\u2019s very, very unfair.\n\nTrump on Trumponomics:Nationalism plus flexibility\n\nLeader:The impulsiveness and shallowness of America\u2019s president threaten the economy as well as the rule of law\n\nBriefing 1:Donald Trump\u2019s economic strategy\n\nBriefing 2:The contradiction at the heart of Trumponomics\n\nBriefing 3:What Donald Trump means by fair trade\n\nNow at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, it\u2019s gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love to\u2026they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. \u201cWe would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, it is. Absolutely.\u201d So, so we did that and we\u2019ll start.\n\nWe have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track I\u2019ve ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. It\u2019s called a cooling-off period, OK? But that\u2019s not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I don\u2019t want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still haven\u2019t given me approval. And the reason they haven\u2019t is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesn\u2019t go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. He\u2019ll be in sometime, I guess next week?\n\nSteve Mnuchin: Yep, yep.\n\nPresident Trump: And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, \u201cCan we negotiate?\u201d I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I don\u2019t know what a hundred days is going to be like. What\u2019s it going to be like? So NAFTA\u2019s a horrible one-sided deal that\u2019s cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nBig isn\u2019t a good enough word. Massive.\n\nHuge?\n\nIt\u2019s got to be. It\u2019s got to be.\n\nWhat would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nNo, it\u2019s gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.\n\nWhat would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nI was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasn\u2019t like\u2026this wasn\u2019t a game I was playing. I\u2019m not playing\u2026you know, I wasn\u2019t playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, I\u2019d never even thought about\u2026it\u2019s always the best when you really feel this way. But I was\u2026I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, that\u2019s fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It would\u2019ve been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, \u201cI will not.\u201d\n\nBut Mr President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?\n\nWe have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70\u2014almost a $70bn trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15bn dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, they\u2019ve been negotiating for 35 years. And it\u2019s been\u2026it\u2019s been terrible for the United States. You know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just been terrible. They\u2019ve never been able to make it.\n\nDoes that $70bn deficit have to come to zero to be fair?\n\nNot necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because I\u2019m not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesn\u2019t have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?\n\nNo, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing that\u2019s bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, \u201cWhen do we start this negotiation?\u201d They said, \u201cSir, it hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\u201d because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, who\u2019s our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, \u201cYou must be kidding.\u201d So it\u2019s a real deficit. Now that\u2019s a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. That\u2019s bad, everything\u2019s bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and it\u2019s up for renegotiation and we\u2019ve informed them that we\u2019ll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We don\u2019t want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.\n\nSome people think this is a negotiating tactic\u2014that you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, really not a negotiation. It\u2019s really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldn\u2019t? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Goes off the record.] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, it\u2019s very short [laughter], you know when I\u2019m with [Xi Jinping], because he\u2019s great, when I\u2019m with him, he\u2019s a great guy. He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, \u201cWe have a problem and we\u2019re going to solve that problem.\u201d But he wants to help us solve that problem.\n\nNow then you never know what\u2019s going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, \u201cDonald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulator\u201d. Now I have to understand something. I\u2019m dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, no\u2026because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, he\u2019s a great guy.\n\nNow, with that in mind, he\u2019s representing China and he wants what\u2019s best for China. But so far, you know, he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been very good. But, so they talk about why haven\u2019t you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, \u201cJinping. Please help us, let\u2019s make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way we\u2019re announcing tomorrow that you\u2019re a currency manipulator, OK?\u201d They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didn\u2019t call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, they\u2019re actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since I\u2019ve been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.\n\nOne last question on trade. Do you think you\u2019ve permanently changed the Republican Party\u2019s position on trade?\n\nNo. Because there\u2019ll always be someone that comes along with another idea but it\u2019s not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasn\u2019t two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didn\u2019t meet that time limit they said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it there\u201d, well, they shouldn\u2019t have set a time limit.\n\nOn another element of Trumponomics, immigration\u2026\n\nRight.\n\nDo you want to curb legal immigration?\n\nOh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.\n\nAnd what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?\n\nOh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, they\u2019re very strong, they\u2019re very good, I like them very much. We\u2019re going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not getting\u2026not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.\n\nBut the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? You\u2019re not looking to reduce the numbers?\n\nOh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now they\u2019re going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, we\u2019ve broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, we\u2019re up to 73, it\u2019s going to go up to almost 80% at the border, we\u2019ve\u2026you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, we\u2019re going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, they\u2019re great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.\n\nAnother part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax reform didn\u2019t.\n\nWell, it actually did. But, but it\u2019s called priming the pump. You know, if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he going with taxes first, that\u2019s his wheelhouse?\u201d Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And they\u2019re great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400bn to $900bn.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.\n\nBut beyond that it\u2019s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?\n\nIt is OK, because it won\u2019t increase it for long. You may have two years where you\u2019ll\u2026you understand the expression \u201cprime the pump\u201d?\n\nYes.\n\nWe have to prime the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s very Keynesian.\n\nWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?\n\nPriming the pump?\n\nYeah, have you heard it?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you heard that expression used before? Because I haven\u2019t heard it. I mean, I just\u2026I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It\u2019s what you have to do.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026\n\nYeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2trn over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.\n\nSo you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?\n\nSo I happen to think that 3% is low. But you can\u2019t do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, I\u2019m going to do something there too. If our companies leave the country, number one they\u2019re leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leave\u2014go back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever they\u2019re building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, that\u2019s not going to happen anymore. They\u2019re going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.\n\nNow when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So we\u2019re not leaving. I don\u2019t know if you saw what\u2019s happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. They\u2019re all cancelling plans because I told them, I said\u2026I get along with them great. But I said, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant. But when you build your car, you\u2019re going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have. You\u2019re going to have a 35% tax.\u201d\n\nSo I mean, I have, it has, I haven\u2019t been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But that\u2019s not a tax increase, that\u2019s no tax. In other words, all you have to do is don\u2019t leave and you won\u2019t have a\u2026but we\u2019re bringing our taxes down so low that you won\u2019t even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.\n\nThe other thing, just in case we\u2026I believe it could be anywhere from $4trn to $5trn outside, you know don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve been talking about $2.5trn for four years now. I\u2019ve been using $2.5trn, the same number we\u2019ve all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think it\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was $5trn but, you know, we\u2019re close. We\u2019re letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. It\u2019s got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. We\u2019re going to make it 10%. Now it\u2019s 35%...\n\nSorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?\n\nThe repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing that\u2019s too high is the bureaucracy.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you can\u2019t because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so many\u2026\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re going to make it simple\n\nPresident Trump: You have to do\u2026Steve, they told me you\u2019ve got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost don\u2019t allow you to bring it back in.\n\nCan I ask you a question about the politics of tax?\n\nIt should be like one page.\n\nThe politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?\n\nUm. Little bit.\n\nAnd to get Democratic support, they prefer\u2026\n\nDepending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept we\u2019ve got to\u2026but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6trn in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. It\u2019s religious liberty out there. [NB. Immediately after this interview, President Trump was due to sign an executive order promoting religious liberty.]\n\nMr President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they\u2019re not going to\u2026nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I\u2019ll release them. Maybe I\u2019ll release them after I\u2019m finished because I\u2019m very proud of them actually. I did a good job.\n\nHope Hicks [White House director of strategic communication]: Once the audit is over.\n\nPresident Trump: I might release them after I\u2019m out of office.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Just so you know, I\u2019ve already started meeting with Democratic senators and, you know, the support has been pretty interesting. I mean, I think a lot of the Democratic senators actually believe we\u2019re on to the right tax plan to bring back business to America, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re all about, they want to grow jobs in their states, just like the president does.\n\nMs Hicks: And our plan has things like child-care tax credits which have never been presented before\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: By the way, so as you know I\u2019m under routine audit, so they\u2019re not going to be done. But you know, at a certain point, that\u2019s something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.\n\nRight, got that.\n\nI would never do it. That would be\u2026I think that would be unfair to the deal. It would be disrespectful of the importance of this deal. Because the only people that find that important are the reporters.\n\nWell, the Democrats say it\u2019s important.\n\nWell, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, \u201cOh but you have to do it,\u201d I said, \u201cLook where I am\u201d. I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, I\u2019m under routine audit.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And the president\u2019s financial disclosure has been longer than any\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.\n\nMs Hicks: I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what we\u2019re focused on.\n\nPresident Trump: Right.\n\nCan I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because you\u2019ve spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workers\u2026\n\nRight, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.\n\nBut the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t believe that. Because they\u2019re losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.\n\nBut something like eliminating the estate tax.\n\nI get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductions\u2026now you\u2019re going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But we\u2019re not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes it\u2026you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly it\u2019s pretty well covered. Hard to believe.\n\nWill you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest payments\u2026\n\nDo you want to answer?\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re contemplating it. We\u2019re contemplating it.\n\nContemplating getting rid of it?\n\nMr Mnuchin: No, we\u2019re contemplating keeping it. That\u2019s our preference. But we\u2019ll look at everything.\n\nSo what would your preference be Mr President? You know about that very well.\n\nNo, I would say probably\u2026I think we\u2019re contemplating is the word. And it hasn\u2019t been determined yet, but we\u2019re contemplating.\n\nContemplating\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re contemplating various\u2026I have to say, we\u2019re contemplating various things, but one of the things that\u2019s very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, it\u2019s complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.\n\nAnd are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?\n\nWell, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.\n\nAre you still\u2026\n\nPart of the problem with NAFTA is that Mexico\u2019s a VAT. So Mexico is paying almost\u2026we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So that\u2019s like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, they\u2019re down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?\n\nBut would you consider\u2026\n\nYou could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, it\u2019s 17 and it\u2019s really 17 and it\u2019s a double.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right\n\nWould you consider a VAT for the United States?\n\nWell the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country because we\u2019re used to an income tax, we\u2019re used to a\u2026people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, they\u2019re used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And it\u2019s, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always saying\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a good tax.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, \u201cYes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat kind of tax is this, I like this tax.\u201d But the VAT is\u2026I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t mean because of, you know, getting it back, you don\u2019t get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country, I think it\u2019s too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and it\u2019s very much of a hidden tax, people don\u2019t see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following week\u2026many years ago, how old is that? 35?\n\nMr Mnuchin: 35 years ago.\n\nPresident Trump: But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.\n\nBut as you said Mr President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?\n\nWe are dealing with Congress\u2026because it\u2019s not really what I\u2019m considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and there\u2019s still a little bit further to go because we\u2019re also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced they\u2019re pulling out. You have states that aren\u2019t going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, \u201cOh, Obamacare is so wonderful,\u201d there is no Obamacare, it\u2019s dead. Plus we\u2019re subsidising it and we don\u2019t have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.\n\nYou\u2019d pull the plug on that? If this bill doesn\u2019t go through you\u2019d stop those subsidies?\n\nNo, this bill only gives them one month. They don\u2019t realize that, that\u2019s another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidy\u2026\n\nThe continuation of the subsidy?\n\nThe subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actually\u2026\n\nBut my question is if the bill doesn\u2019t pass\u2026\n\nIn actuality Congress has to approve it. Congress\u2026\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass would you cut the subsidies?\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass, I\u2019d be in a different position. Because, if the bill didn\u2019t pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then I\u2019d have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be much less expensive. We\u2019re going to have competition, we\u2019re getting rid of the state lines, etc etc. The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didn\u2019t pass\u2026it\u2019s a great question, I don\u2019t want to think about that but the answer is\u2026I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.\n\nOne of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like \u201cI want everyone to be covered\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to let people die on the streets.\n\nBut some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.\n\nOK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. It\u2019s a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, we\u2019re putting in $8bn, into the pool. So depending on what states do\u2026because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases that\u2019ll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isn\u2019t, where they\u2019re not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, \u201cIf you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee.\u201d\n\nThe state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But we\u2019re putting in $8bn and you\u2019re going to have absolute coverage. You\u2019re going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. You\u2019re going to have it if you\u2019re a person going in\u2026don\u2019t forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, you\u2019re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you\u2019re 70, and you really need it, you\u2019re still paying the same amount and that\u2019s really insurance.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadn\u2019t heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that\u2026first of all I don\u2019t want to end it for the people that already have it. And I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that hasn\u2019t been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life he\u2019s been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and we\u2019re\u2026you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow, that will even get better as it\u2019s going along, it\u2019s going to get better. But in a way you could say, that\u2019s not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it as\u2026I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something that\u2019s very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don\u2019t get any benefit out of it. We don\u2019t have that. We\u2019re going to have much lower premiums and we\u2019re going to have much lower deductibles.\n\nBut when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to look after people\u2026\n\nThey came through.\n\nThey came through? So do you still have to keep them in line.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2026Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?\n\nMike Pence, the vice-president, enters the room: Morning all.\n\nPresident Trump: Central casting.\n\nMr Pence: Please sit, sit, sit.\n\nMs Hicks: We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.\n\nPresident Trump: So I know exactly the speeches you\u2019re talking about. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow people to die on the streets\u201d, and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. We\u2019re talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8bn to the high-risk pools.\n\nMr Pence: Yes, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: People are going to have\u2026they\u2019re going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and we\u2019re refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.\n\nSo, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wanted\u2026although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasn\u2019t a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.\n\nLook, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obamacare, you get your doctor; that was a lie. You get your plan; that was a lie. With us, you get your doctor. You get your plan. With us you\u2019ll get hundreds and hundreds of plans. You know, one of the insurance companies, one of the big ones came to see me yesterday. They\u2019re so anxious to start going crazy and you know it\u2019s going to be like life insurance. People that buy life insurance they\u2019re inundated with carriers. All different plans. That\u2019s what this is going to be like. And I said to them, \u201cWhat do you think the good plans are going to look like?\u201d He said, \u201cMr President, we\u2019re going to have so many plans. We\u2019re going to have the low version, the high version\u201d, he used the word Cadillac. I won\u2019t tell you what car he used for the low version because I don\u2019t want you to write it because they happen to be friends of mine, you know, the head people. [Goes off the record.]\n\nMr President, in business you keep score of your profits. How do you keep score in Trumponomics and in politics?\n\nWell I think the score is going to be the end of the game. To me the score is going to have to be at the end of the game. I was saying, Mike, that we\u2019re going to prime the pump with the taxes because we\u2019re going to take in perhaps a little bit less, but we\u2019re going to have a lot more business, we\u2019re going to have companies coming back into the country.\n\nI know a lot of companies that want to come back in but they\u2019re not going to come back in because of taxes. And we have a lot of companies that will come back into the country. They were forced out of the country because the taxes were too high. Many, many. You look at what\u2019s going on in certain countries. In fact I own a lot of property in certain countries where they were forced out.\n\nYou look at Ireland. I own great property in Ireland that I bought during their downturn. And I give the Irish a lot, a lot of credit. They never raised their taxes. You know you would have thought when they were going through that really\u2026they would\u2019ve double and tripled their taxes. They never raised it a penny. And they got through it and they are thriving now. Ireland\u2019s done an amazing job. A lot of companies have moved to Ireland and they like it.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to be getting a lot of companies moving back and we\u2019re going to get very few companies leaving the United States because we went from the highest tax rate of\u2026not only major, you know they always say major countries, just about the highest tax rate period. And then when you add all the other things. And then when you add the regulations to the tax\u2026I\u2019ve had people tell me, because I\u2019ve cut massive regulations and we\u2019ve just started, believe me. But we\u2019ve cut regulations massively.\n\nI\u2019ve had people tell me that the cutting of those regulations is more important to them than bringing it down from 35% to 15%. And if you would have told me that, if I had a guess one before I knew the answer, I would\u2019ve said, nobody would\u2019ve taken the regulations. 90% of the people would rather have the regulations cut. So when you talk about the tax cut, the regulation cut, Dodd-Frank, you\u2019ll be doing a story on that fairly soon because we\u2019re doing a very massive overhaul on Dodd-Frank. We\u2019re doing things that are going to keep people real happy.\n\nAnd then ultimately, when I leave office, on the assumption [Mike Pence] doesn\u2019t follow me, but he will. But when I leave office what happens is slowly they\u2019ll nip away at it, nip away, nip away and then in 40, 50 years somebody else will come along and bring it back. But we\u2019re bringing back entrepreneurship. We\u2019re bringing back enthusiasm. And if you look at the people that read your magazine, that are in this country, the enthusiasm levels, and you know this because you see it, are the highest they've even been. The enthusiasm levels for manufacturers went up 27 points in two months. If it goes up a quarter of point it\u2019s like a massive\u2026it went up 27% in two months, up to 93%, they\u2019ve never been even close. The enthusiasm for business is the highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nMs Hicks: And we\u2019ll have you guys back to talk about it. Sorry\n\nThank you so much, Mr President.\n\nI hope you had enough time.\n\nYou\u2019ve been very kind.",

Hillary Clinton \u00b7 Follow Published in Hillary for America \u00b7 \u00b7 Aug 15, 2016 5 min read -- 13 Listen Share\n\nToday marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15\u201330 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you\u2019ve ever really known.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who\u2019ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.\n\nI\u2019m sure this election has been stressful for you.\n\nIt can\u2019t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation\u2019s problems. That\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not kind, and it\u2019s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.\n\nMany of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You\u2019ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn\u2019t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.\n\nI want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential \u2014 that\u2019s what makes our country great, and that\u2019s the promise I\u2019m going to fight to fulfill.\n\nSo here\u2019s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you\u2019ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country \u2014 and that\u2019s what DACA can provide.\n\nBut I know that\u2019s not enough \u2014 we have to do more for you and your families. That\u2019s why as president, I\u2019m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.\n\nWhile we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court\u2019s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president\u2019s authority and won\u2019t stop fighting until we see it through.\n\nSo today, let\u2019s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it\u2019s helped so far \u2014 and let\u2019s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.\n\nWe have always been a nation of immigrants \u2014 those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won\u2019t forget it, and I won\u2019t forget you.\n\nThank you \u2014 and keep being brave,\n\nHillary",

    "text":"Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points \u2014 resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News\/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nClinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.\n\nIn a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.\n\nLooking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).\n\nThe NBC\/WSJ poll \u2014 conducted May 15-19 \u2014 comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.\n\nRepublicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.\n\nComplete Coverage: Decision 2016\n\nWhile Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clinton\u2019s challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Unpopular\n\nTrump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC\/WSJ poll.\n\nThirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20) \u2014 a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month.\n\nTrump's rating is even worse than Clinton\u2019s: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29) \u2014 an improvement from his minus-41 score in April.\n\n\u201cThis has never been matched, or even close to being matched,\u201d Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton.\n\nBy contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus 36 percent who have a negative view (+7). One difference Clinton and Sanders: Clinton\u2019s rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive, 41 percent negative (-3); Sanders\u2019 rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive, 23 percent negative (+31).\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s overall score in the current NBC\/WSJ poll is at 49 percent positive, 41 percent negative (+8).\n\nForty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate\n\nAsked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012.\n\nFifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.\n\nThe NBC\/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline. The overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.",

    "text":"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.\n\nTrump said, \"China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.\"\n\nWith the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\"\n\nWhen we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea\u2019s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of \"total control.\"\n\n\"China does not \u2018control\u2019 North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,\" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.\n\nRobert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.\n\n\"It\u2019s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,\" Ross said. \"Do the parents have total control? Perhaps \u2013 they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive \u2013 driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.\"\n\nChina\u2019s leverage over North Korea\n\nThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.\n\nNorth Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea\u2019s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.\n\n\"North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,\" Haggard told PolitiFact.\n\nWhy \u2018total control\u2019 is an exaggeration\n\nYet while China\u2019s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn\u2019t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump\u2019s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\n\nFor starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.\n\n\"China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,\" Haggard said.\n\nIt also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn\u2019t exactly listen to outsiders.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,\" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. \"This is hardly control.\"\n\nNot only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country\u2019s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.\n\n\"North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,\" Revere said. \"This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.\"\n\nIndeed, despite North Korea\u2019s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, \"it is not clear that the leadership cares,\" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. \"For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea\u2019s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China\u2019s situation.\n\nThis was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.\n\n\"China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,\" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.\"\n\nThat does not sound like a country in \"total control\" of another.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim \"suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,\" Revere said. \"It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\"\n\nHe has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea\u2019s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump\u2019s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government\u2019s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching \"total control\" over North Korea.\n\nThe statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",

    "text":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn't unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile's stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile's girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile's killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video \"is pretty horrific,\" said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. \"There are things we don't know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases \u2014 whether explicit or implicit \u2014 about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.\"\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile's stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him \"for no apparent reason\" after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son \"was just black in the wrong place.\" Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n\"Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,\" said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can't simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n\"When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,\" said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. \"That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.\"\n\nLast year, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n\"Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we're facing ambiguous situations,\" Fridell said. \"A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren't going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.\"\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

And it allows our law enforcement officials to focus on criminals who really posed a threat and ought to be the focus here. But the only permanent way to fix our immigration system, certainly to provide a permanently relief for DREAM Act eligible populations is for Congress to act.\n\nWALLACE: You mentioned Governor Romney. I don't to get into the whole thing about the differences will get to the economy in a minute. But specifically for Hispanic voters, do you think there's a clear choice between Obama and Romney?\n\nPLOUFFE: I think there's a clear choice for everybody.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I'm asking about Hispanics.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, first of all --\n\nWALLACE: On this issue of immigration.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, first of all, Hispanic voters highly support the health care bill, what we're trying to do in education. On immigration, yes, this is a president who's tried to get immigration done in a comprehensive way. We're getting close to getting the DREAM Act done.\n\nSo, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants. And that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that. Governor Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Governor Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport.\n\nSo, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust. And this one of the important choices that the president talked about earlier this week in Ohio. President Romney if he's elected is not going to fix our immigration system. He's been very clear about that. You watch Republican debate after Republican debate, many of them on your network, where Governor Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act. He thinks these 11 million people ought to just be sent home.\n\nSo, I think that's a clear choice just not for the Latino community, but for the American electorate at large.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the economy. The president gave a major economic speech this week in Ohio in which he called for targeted investments for things like energy and education and state workers, first responders and teachers, and tax hikes for the wealthy. But there was -- forgive me -- nothing new.\n\nIs that the president's agenda for the next four years -- pass the jobs plan that I have been pushing for over the last 12 months and that will fix the economy?\n\nPLOUFFE: What the president laid out is a clear choice facing the American people. And the contrast could not be clear. This is a president who believes we need to grow the economy by putting the middle class first, creating middle class jobs, by reducing the deficit in a fair or balanced way, and making sure we can invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and science and research.\n\nThe congressional Republican approach, Governor Romney's approach -- by the way, it's fitting, he's with John Boehner today -- because Governor Romney is going to rubber stamp the Republican agenda, which basically gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy. They believe the economy works best from the top down. That's failed.\n\nBy the way, Governor Romney wouldn't reduce the deficit. Every independent economists who's looked at this plan says he would add to the deficit, he would starve investment in education, he would allow infrastructure to deteriorate even more. This is not a recipe for growing the economy, reducing the deficit or helping the middle class. So, that's the stark choice --\n\nWALLACE: Does the president's agenda -- because I did not hear anything new in Ohio -- is the president's agenda for the next four years more of the same?\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, what it is, is what this country needs to do, which is reduce the deficit in a right way, fair and balanced way.\n\nWALLACE: I like the fact that you keep saying fair and balanced.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, it's the right way, which is we need to cut more spending. This president has already signed into law, by the way, over -- almost $2 trillion on spending cuts. We have to focus on what is going to grow this economy for the middle class. And that's going to be continuing to focus on our manufacturing --\n\nWALLACE: But you would agree, there is no new agenda beyond what he is pushing for the last year?\n\nPLOUFFE: This is the direction he thinks that the country needs to go.\n\nNow, let's look at the other direction, it failed miserably. When Governor Romney led Massachusetts, number one debt in the country -- think about that. Added debt. For all of this talk about government, for every private sector job created in Massachusetts by Governor Romney, six public sector jobs.\n\nThis is someone who -- his state was 47 in job creation. And he wants to return to the same policies that led to the great recession that, you know, caused a huge harm to our businesses, our economy and people in this country.\n\nSo, the choice is clear here.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nPLOUFFE: The choice is clear.\n\nWALLACE: I have a couple of minutes left and I want to get to these campaign questions. You were the Obama campaign manager in 2008. I ask about whether there's anything new, because you are taking hits right now -- you, the campaign -- from some notable Democrats like James Carville and Bill Clinton, who are saying that you need to stop talking about the progress we've made and start talking about a new agenda, how things in the next four years are going to be different than they were in the last one.\n\nAre they wrong?\n\nPLOUFFE: First of all, President Clinton, he's appeared with President Obama. He said very clearly that we are beginning to grow again. We're beginning to make progress. We can't return to the same policy.\n\nPresident Clinton is someone knows something about reducing the deficit, about creating jobs, and he's been very clear -- he thinks Mitt Romney would be a disaster for this country.\n\nSo, listen, those other Democrats aren't paying attention to what the president said, which is everyday, not just on what he said, but what he does -- he understands our economy is not strong as it needs to be, that this didn't happen overnight, it's going to take us a long time to recover, there's a lot of people out there hurting.\n\nSo, we are making progress. We need to make a lot of more. That's very clear.\n\nWALLACE: But you said, just a few months ago, that trajectory in the economy is going well. We had fewer and fewer jobs, each of the last four months. GDP growth is 1.9 percent, 69,000 jobs, the lowest in the year created. The trajectory is not going like this anymore, sir. It's going like this.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, compared to where we were in recession we had over 4 million jobs created over the last 26 months. We had that private sector jobs --\n\nWALLACE: But you've got three and a half years to fix it. PLOUFFE: Well, listen, this is a deep hole caused by the same policies Mitt Romney wants to go back to. This is what folks need to focus on. We just went through recession.\n\nRemarkably, what Mitt Romney and the congressional Republicans want to do is, hey, I guess that worked out well. Let's go back to the same rules. Let Wall Street writes its own rules, make it easier to polluters to foul our air more, huge tax cuts to people like Mitt Romney and basically paid for by raising taxes on working Americans, and making it harder for people to get education, not believing in the new energy future, not rebuilding this country.\n\nSo, listen, this is a tough recession we are recovering from. We are making slow and steady progress. Nobody is satisfied. The president most of all knows we have to recover more quickly, create jobs more quickly. But the choice is, are we going to continue and move forward -- are we going to go back to the same policies that caused the recession?\n\nWALLACE: I got it. One last question --\n\nPLOUFFE: It's important. Nothing is more important than this, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: One more question real quickly, any chance you'll leave the White House, go back to Chicago and run this campaign.",

    "text":"July 11, 2010 \u2014 -- JAKE TAPPER, HOST: I know that there are some in the White House who feel Wall Street reform, health care legislation, stimulus, and yet the public still overwhelmingly thinks this country is on the wrong track.\n\nAre you not getting enough credit, you and the administration?\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, these are gigantic packages to deal with a gigantic problem we inherited. And the vast majority of the American people and a lot of people really involved don't even know what's inside the packages. And so you have, for example, Mr. Boehner already calling for the repeal of -- of the reform that just passed on Wall Street. People don't realize, in that reform, you know, you say, look, we've had meat inspection for 100 years ago, the meat packing companies didn't like it. Automobile safety 50 years ago.\n\nPeople are going to look back on this very shortly and say, why shouldn't we have some consumer group in -- entity looking at whether or not you can give someone a mortgage with no down payment, with no -- with a teaser interest rate, with no documentation, etc.\n\nSo it is -- people don't know that. Just like people don't know a lot of what's going on in The Recovery Act, understandably, because this has been so much stuff that has been flowing our way. And -- and we're facing a bunch of guys who are good guys, but they're all about repeal and -- and repeat. Repeal what we're doing and go back, repeal the incentives for industry to invest in solar energy. Repeal the health care bill that allows you to keep your kid on your health care policy, precondi -- preexisting conditions can't deny you policies, etc.\n\nIt's just going to take time. This is Jan -- this is July. The election is not until November. And I think we're going to have to firmly make our case. I think we can make it and especially in the context of who's going to be opposing us.\n\nCompared to the alternative, I think we're going to get a fair amount of credit by November and I think we're going to do fine.\n\nTAPPER: So the reason you're not getting enough credit is because the public doesn't understand everything that's happened yet?\n\nBIDEN: Well, nor could they or should they. Look, in the last six months of the Bush administration, they lost three million jobs. Before we got our economic package in place, another 3.7 million jobs were lost in the first six months we took office. The last six months of this year -- the first six months of this year, we created almost 600,000 private jobs, you know, in the private market. That's not nearly enough to make up for the eight million jobs lost in the recession. But people are going to start to focus on exactly what we're doing. And all -- look, I'm convinced, at least from sitting around my dad's kitchen table and -- and the people I grew up with is when things are really tough economically and the country is in trouble, all they want to know is, they -- they don't expect an answer, but they expect to be reassured that we're moving in the right direction.\n\nThat is...\n\nTAPPER: But they don't think that we are.\n\nBIDEN: No. No, they don't think now because I don't think they know the detail of what's going on.\n\nFor example, here you had the insurance industry spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make the health care bill out to be this God awful tragedy.\n\nNow what's starting off to happen?\n\nThe health care numbers are going up.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they're figuring out that small businesses are going to get a 30 percent tax cut. They didn't know that because of all the advertising done.\n\nSo there's a lot -- and -- and I would use health care as an example. Health care has gone from a barrage of advertising against it, why it was so bad, just like Wall Street reform. The financial industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying against this \u2013 this is an awful thing, it's government regulation. All it is, is rational control and the turning around of what the Republicans did, which is let Wall Street run wild.\n\nPeople -- when you say to people, you know, we just went out and had a regulatory reform bill, where I come from, it's like, OK, what -- what does that mean?\n\nThey don't know what it means yet, understandably. And so I think it takes time, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: There's that famous saying in Washington by Mike Kinsley that a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Robert Gibbs experienced some of that this -- this past few days...\n\nBIDEN: I've never had a gaffe.\n\nTAPPER: You've never had an issue with gaffes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTAPPER: No, I know. So you can't relate.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nTAPPER: But -- but he said that enough seats are in the play in the House for the Democrats to possibly lose the House. Empirically true.\n\nHow bad are the losses going to be for Democrats?\n\nBIDEN: I don't think the losses are going to be bad at all. I think we're going to shock the heck out of everybody. I really -- and I've been saying this now. I think even when you and I went down to North Carolina and you followed be on the recovery trip, I was saying it then. I am absolutely confidence -- confident when people take a look at the what has happened since we've taken office in November and comparing it to the alternative, we're going to be very -- we're going to be in great shape.\n\nHere's the deal. What Robert Gibbs also said was what he believes, what I believe, what the president believes, we're going to win the House and we're going to win the Senate. We're not going to lose either one of those bodies.\n\nAnd so, again, this is July. November and at the time, the most vulnerable time any public official finds himself in is when they have no opponent.\n\nLook at Harry Reid. You know, I got -- I got kind of banged around for saying I think there was a 55 percent chance Harry Reid is going to win. Well, Harry Reid, when he was the -- you know, on the other side of the barrage of how bad Harry Reid was, was in trouble. Now Harry Reid, in the last poll, was up 7 points. I -- he I think he -- I -- I'd bet anything -- I'm not allowed to bet, but I'll bet Harry Reid wins. You're going to see that repeated.\n\nSo, that old -- to paraphrase Mark Twain, I think the -- the reports of our demise are premature.\n\nTAPPER: The NAACP had a convention in the last week. And they passed a resolution saying that elements of the Tea Party are racist.\n\nDo you think elements of the Tea Party are racist?\n\nBIDEN: Well, the truth is that at least elements that were involved in some of the Tea Party folks expressed racist views. We saw that on television and it was turned -- but I don't think -- I don't -- I wouldn't characterize the Tea Party as racist. There are individuals who are either members of or on the periphery of some of their things, their -- their protests -- that have expressed really unfortunate comments. And, again, it was all over TV, all over your network, you know?\n\nA black congressman walking up the stairs of the Capitol.\n\nBut I don't believe, the president doesn't believe that the Tea Party is -- is a racist organization. I don't believe that. Very conservative. Very different views on government and a whole lot of things. But it is not a racist organization.\n\nTAPPER: One of the big issues in this election, in this mid-term election is the economy.\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nTAPPER: Non-financial institutions are sitting on $1.8 trillion in cash money that could be spent expanding, creating jobs...\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nTAPPER: -- and they're not spending it on that -- that way. A lot of members of the business community in the last week or so have been saying the reason that money is not being spent on expansion or jobs is because the business community is convinced that the Obama administration is anti-business and they're worried about what legislation, what regulation is coming down the pike.\n\nWhy do you think they're not spending that money?\n\nBIDEN: Three months ago, those same business leaders, they were in the White House in meetings with us saying, you know, you're going to be surprised on the up side how many people we're going to be hiring.\n\nI think that a couple of things have happened.\n\nOne, they didn't anticipate and no one anticipated the potential collapse of the European economy and the so-called Eurozone -- Greece and Spain and all of that. That put a real brake on an awful lot of people in terms of their optimism about where the world economy was going, because we're affected by that indirectly.\n\nSecondly, I think that the very uncertainty they had is now been settled by the passage of the reforms. They didn't know which way they were going to go. They didn't know how much was going to happen.\n\nSo I think there is increased certainty now that the major reform they were worried about is law. It's passed. And they're going to know how to deal with it.\n\nI think you see stabilization on the European side, in terms of the so-called euro and the Eurozone. And I think that's going to help.\n\nSo I think you're going to see them beginning to move.\n\nTAPPER: You said that the stimulus is -- is working.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nTAPPER: And you said earlier, in the past week, you talked about three million jobs being created by the stimulus...\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nTAPPER: -- so far. But since the stimulus passed, more than three million jobs have been lost. And before you took office, three million jobs were lost.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nTAPPER: Was the stimulus, in retrospect, too small?\n\nBIDEN: Look, there's a lot of people at the time argued it was too small. Actually, we...\n\nTAPPER: A lot of people in your administration.\n\nBIDEN: -- yes. A lot of people in our administration, a lot of -- I mean, you know, even some Republican economists and some Nobel laureates like Paul Krugman, who continues to argue it was too small. But, you know, there was a reality. In order to get what we got passed, we had to find Republican votes. And we found three -- three. And we finally got it passed.\n\nSo there is the reality of whether or not the Republicans are willing to play, whether or not the Republicans are just about repeal and repeat the old policies or they're really wanting to do something. And I -- I'm not -- I'm not -- you know...\n\nTAPPER: So if you didn't have Republicans that you had -- if you didn't have the legislative reality...\n\nBIDEN: I think what...\n\nTAPPER: -- it would have been bigger?\n\nBIDEN: I think it would have been bigger. I think it would have been bigger. In fact, what we offered was slightly bigger than that. But the truth of the matter is that the recovery package, everybody's talking about it having -- it's over. The truth is now, we're spending more now this summer than we -- I'm calling this the recovery -- the summer of recovery. We have two, three times as many highway projects going. We have significant investment in broadband for the first time now. It's starting to really ramp up because the contracts have been let. In high speed rail, in wind energy.\n\nI mean, where are the new jobs going to come from?\n\nAnd that's what we're laying the foundation for. And, again, this is a hard slog, man. And it's counter-intuitive. It's counter-intuitive to say someone sitting at a kitchen table in Claymont, Delaware, who lost their jobs \u2013 by the way, we saved or created three million jobs and they pick up when we lost three million.\n\nThe truth is, over three million people who are now working would be out of work but for this. The truth of the matter is there's an overwhelming consensus that we're not losing jobs now, we're creating jobs. The argument's gone from losing jobs to are we creating them fast enough, not whether we're creating them. And nothing is fast enough till you get these people back to work.\n\nTAPPER: Turning to Afghanistan...\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nTAPPER: -- which is foremost on a lot of Americans' minds, I want to read you a quote from Jonathan Alter's new book: \"At the conclusion of an interview in his West Wing office, Vice President Biden was adamant in July of 2011, that we're going to see a whole lot of people moving out. 'Bet on it,' Biden said, as wheeled to leave the room, late for lunch with the president. He turned at the door and said once more, 'Bet on it.'\"\n\nDid you say that to...\n\nBIDEN: I did say that.\n\nTAPPER: -- to Jon Alter?\n\nBIDEN: I did say that.\n\nTAPPER: And what did you mean, a whole lot of people...\n\nBIDEN: Well, what I said...\n\nTAPPER: -- moving out?\n\nBIDEN: -- if you read three or four paragraphs above that, Jonathan was making a very valid point. He was saying a lot in the military think they outmaneuvered the president to render the July date meaningless. And I was saying that's simply not true. The military signed on. Petraeus signed on. Everybody signed onto not a deadline, but a transition, a beginning of a transition.\n\nTAPPER: But what does a whole lot of people moving out mean?\n\nBIDEN: Well, what I was talking about was you have -- we're going to have over 100,000 people there and two...\n\nTAPPER: More, right, if you include NATO troops?\n\nBIDEN: Oh, yeah. I'm just talking about Americans.\n\nTAPPER: Yes.\n\nBIDEN: A hundred and forty thousand people there. And there's going to be a drawdown of forces as we transition. There are 34 districts in Afghanistan and the plan is, as we train up the Afghanis, we are going to, beginning in August, say, OK, now you've got this province, we no longer have to have American or NATO forces in that province. There will be a transition.\n\nAnd really what I was responding to was the idea that the president had been outmaneuvered. I was saying make it clear. And so it -- it wasn't so much numbers I meant. It could be as few as a couple thousand troops. It could be more. But there will be a transition.\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about the present in Afghanistan. Marjah did not as well as hoped. Kandahar has been delayed.\n\nHow is you and the president, your new way forward in Afghanistan, where are we in that?\n\nAre we -- are we losing?\n\nAre we trading water?\n\nWhere are we?\n\nBIDEN: It's too early to make a judgment. We don't even have all the troops of the so-called surge in place yet. That won't happen until August.\n\nTAPPER: But it's not -- it doesn't seem like it's going...\n\nBIDEN: No...\n\nTAPPER: -- according to plan.\n\nBIDEN: No, it is -- well...\n\nTAPPER: We're losing a lot of troops.\n\nBIDEN: Well, unfortunately, everyone knew that in these summer months, when they can infiltrate from Pakistan under the cover of foliage and the rest and it's open, that there would be more deaths. That's been the pattern. And now we're engaging them more and there are more deaths.\n\nBut we still believe that the policy that the military signed onto, put together initially, signed onto, is, in fact, going to work. And let me define what I mean by work. We are making considerable progress against al Qaeda, which is our primary target. We're taking out significant numbers of the leadership in al Qaeda. And we are, in the process, which is painfully slow and difficult, of training up Afghani forces in order to put them in a position they can deal with their own insurgents. There is, for the first time now, a real attempt and a policy of trying to figure out how to reconcile those in the Taliban who are doing it for the pay, who are not the Mullah Omars of the world, into the government of Afghanistan.\n\nAll of this is just beginning. And we knew it was going to be a tough slog. But I think it's much too premature to make a judgment until the military said we should look at it, which is in December.\n\nTAPPER: There was a recent incident involving the commanding general -- now the ex-commanding general in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal. And I just wondered, since you were one of the people mentioned disparagingly by his aides. I know he called you to apologize.\n\nBIDEN: He did.\n\nTAPPER: I'm wondering, what was your reaction when you...\n\nBIDEN: I didn't take it personally at all. I really, honest to God, didn't, compared to what happens in politics, this is -- that was a piece of cake. And it wasn't so disparaging is that I -- I was the enemy. It wasn't that I -- I wasn't the clown. I was the guy who, in fact, was their problem, they thought. I'm not their problem. I agree with the policy the president put in place. But it was clear -- I was asked to and I did on my own survey, I think, six four star generals, including present and former, every single one said he had to go.\n\nSo we did -- we made -- the president made the right decision. He changed the personalities, but not the policy. He put the strongest guy in the U.S. military and a counter-insurgency policy in place.\n\nSo I think it was -- it was the absolutely necessary thing to do. The president didn't take it personally. I didn't. I met with McChrystal. The president met with McChrystal. He was -- he was really apologetic. He knew they had gone way beyond. But we also knew that if a sergeant did that, if a lieutenant did that, I mean no one could stay.\n\nTAPPER: Why do you think they thought of you as the enemy, because you had been in favor of...\n\nBIDEN: Well, because...\n\nTAPPER: -- the counter-terrorism instead of the counter-insurgency?\n\nBIDEN: -- they -- because I had been someone who -- who offered a plan that was different in degree. But, you know, again, I -- I -- someday I'll be able to lay out exactly what the plan I offered was. It would be inappropriate to do that because it was so close to what -- what, in fact, the plan ended up being that there was virtually no difference. But I got characterized because I was really very challenging to some of the assertions made.\n\nIf you notice, what we have is a counter-insurgency plan along the spine of the country, where the population is. It's not a nationwide counter-insurgency plan. We're not engaged in nation-building, which the original discussion was about. We have a rec -- we -- we have a date where we're going to go look and see whether it's working. And we have a timetable in which to transition.\n\nAll of those things were things I was supporting. All those things were -- so. And to -- to conclude, when -- when General Petraeus was picked the day in the office -- it was the day we were supposed to go downstairs into The Situation Room, they call it, to discuss the overall policy. Everyone was there. I pulled him aside and I said, David, there is no daylight between your position and mine.\n\nAnd he said, I know that. Will you tell people that?\n\nTAPPER: Let's switch over now to Iraq.\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nTAPPER: This is your first news interview since returning from Iraq.\n\nBIDEN: True.\n\nTAPPER: There's a -- there's a tremendous stale mat -- stalemate there.\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nTAPPER: Since the March elections, I believe the parliament there has only met for 20 minutes. And just this week in Washington, the Iraqi foreign minister, Zebari, pleaded for more U.S. engagement. He said: \"We believe that there's a role for more engagement to help, to encourage, to facilitate, not to pick and choose the next government or the next leader, but really to play a greater role in the process.\"\n\nYou once advocated for a three way partition of Iraq because you were not confident that Iraq's government was capable of having a strong central government. You said: \"The most basic premise of President Bush's approach that the Iraqi people will rally behind a strong central government headed by Maliki, in fact, looks out for their interests equitably is fundamentally and fatally flawed. It will not happen in anybody's lifetime here including the pages!\"\n\nSo it's -- that was from 2007.\n\nIs it possible that you were right back then...\n\nBIDEN: No.\n\nTAPPER: -- that it is just impossible...\n\nBIDEN: -- and, by the way...\n\nTAPPER: -- to have a centralized government...\n\nBIDEN: No, it's -- I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition. I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions.\n\nTAPPER: Three provinces.\n\nBIDEN: Well, it was...\n\nTAPPER: I'm...\n\nBIDEN: -- not -- it wasn't even, it was to allow them more autonomy, like what's happening in Kurdistan right now, like what's happening in Anbar Province right now. And so what's happening here is, there is an election that's taken place. And what happened-- there's 325 plus members of what they call their core, their parliament. And no one party won more than 91 seats. The two major parties, one won 89 and one won 91 seats. That's Maliki and Allawi, Iraqiya and the State of Law, they call them.\n\nThey're in negotiations right now to figure out how to allocate the power within that government. In other words, share power. And it is about just that. And it's underway. And it's going to happen. There will be a central government with control of its foreign policy, with control of the military. But you will see that there are going to be significant amounts of autonomy in each of the areas that exist in these provinces. That's what their constitution calls for.\n\nAnd, look, it took the Dutch six months to form a parliament the time before last. It took the -- the folks in the Netherlands six months, 280 some days, if I'm not mistaken. So this is -- and this is their first crack at democracy.\n\nI used the phrase politics has broken out, not war. We're moving in that direction.\n\nTAPPER: And the combat mission ends at the end of August.\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nTAPPER: And can that happen even if there isn't an Iraqi government?\n\nBIDEN: There is a transition government. There is a government in place that's working. Iraqi security is being provided by the Iraqis, with our assistance. We're going to have -- still have 50,000 troops there. We will have brought home 95,000. There is no one in the military who thinks there's any reason we can't do that\n\nSo they're making real serious progress. I don't have a doubt in my mind that we'll be able to meet the commitment of having only 50,000 troops there and it will not in any way affect the physical stability of Iraq.\n\nTAPPER: You spoke to the leader of Southern Sudan...\n\nBIDEN: I did.\n\nTAPPER: -- recently.\n\nBIDEN: Kiir.\n\nTAPPER: And the referendum on whether or not Southern Sudan can break away from Sudan takes place in January. There's a lot of concern by human rights groups that that election will be riddled with fraud, just like the ones in April.\n\nBIDEN: A legitimate concern.\n\nTAPPER: The White House's point man on the Sudan is in the -- has said that the U.S. has waning influence in the region, General Grationsaid that.\n\nAre you willing to pledge that the U.S. will make sure that they're -- that war does not break out between Sudan and Southern Sudan should that happen?\n\nBIDEN: We're doing everything in our power to make sure this election on the referendum is viewed by the world as legitimate and fair. That's why we've been pushing the UN. That's why we've been pushing Kiir. That's why I've been working with Mbeki. That's why I've been working with President Mubarak, all who have significant influence in this.\n\nAnd it must be viewed as credible to keep that country, that region, from deteriorating. The last thing we need is another failed state in the region. And I'm still hopeful. We are on it full-time. And -- I believe that we'll be able to pull -- they'll be able to pull off, with our help and the UN's help, they'll be able to pull off a credible election.\n\nTAPPER: What's the larger strategy for combating Islamo-terrorism or Islamic fascism, as some people call it?\n\nEven if Iraq works, even if Afghanistan works, it pops up everywhere. It pops up in Yemen. It pops up in Somalia. It pops up in Uganda.\n\nWhat's the larger vision?\n\nHow does the U.S. combat that?\n\nBIDEN: The larger vision is to appeal to the moderate Islamic states and the moderate Muslim world, which is the vast majority of the world. That's the first piece.\n\nThe second piece is, in those areas which the radicals can feed on and breed off of is to try to help stabilize those governments, not alone, but with the rest of the world. And part of that is building strong countries around them, as well as inside.\n\nAnd it's a long-term deal. But I think we're making progress. And President Obama ju-- -- you know, I got asked the other day, you know, well, you ran for president, you know, you're vice president. I said we got the order right. Even if I had been a great president and been elected, it would have taken me four years to do what he did in one month. In one month, he changed the attitude of the world about American intentions.\n\nAnd the Muslim world and the moderate Muslim world no longer thinks it's us or them. The most important one that we're finishing up now, God willing, is Iraq. Imagine Iraq as a stable country in the midst of that part of the world, a very positive outcome.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Vice President, thanks for spending your time with us.\n\nBIDEN: Thank you, Jake.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKING: The Palin family bombshell.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Bristol and Levi Johnston are not only back together, they're getting married.\n\nB. PALIN: I came home from work one day, and there was rose petals in the shape of a heart on my bed, and then he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Her engagement to Johnston happened without the approval of their parents.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We have a statement out this morning from the Palins, and they say, \"Bristol, at 19, is now a young adult. We obviously want what is best for our children.\"\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Bristol and Levi, one of the many topics we will not be discussing on our roundtable this morning with George Will, former Bush White House communications director Nicolle Wallace, also author of the pending novel \"Eighteen Acres,\" which my wife has not been able to put down -- thank you for joining us -- Clarence Page of the \"Chicago Tribune,\" and former Clinton White House press secretary and \"Vanity Fair\" contributing editor Dee Dee Myers.\n\nThank you, one and all, for being here. I want to start off with the interview with the vice president, because as is his wont, he did make some news in some various areas.\n\nGeorge, the vice president said that we are not engaging in nation-building in Afghanistan. And yet if you look at the cover of this week's \"Newsweek,\" the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, says, \"Rethinking Afghanistan, nation-building isn't working.\" Are we doing nation-building in Afghanistan or are we not?\n\nWILL: We are. Nation-building is what counterinsurgency is, as defined by David Petraeus. It is to protect the people. It is to make them loyal by giving them local services, inventing a government, in effect. That is nation-building, which means that the Obama policy in Afghanistan is much more ambitious than was the Bush policy.\n\nThe vice president said something else that was very interesting. He said, \"We are making considerable progress against Al Qaida, which is our primary target. We're taking out significant numbers of the leadership in Al Qaida.\" The latter is true, but they're doing that in Pakistan, because, as you established with Leon Panetta three weeks ago on this program, you asked him, \"How many Al Qaida do you think are in Afghanistan?\" Panetta, \"I think at most we're looking at 50 to 100, maybe less.\"\n\nTAPPER: Nicolle, one thing that I heard out of the vice president's mouth that I thought might be of interest to you was towards the end of the interview when he was talking about what -- how great it would be to have Iraq this shining example of democracy in the middle of the Middle East. Did that resonate at all with the former...\n\nWALLACE: Yes, imagine that. Imagine making that case. Obviously, these are the kinds of arguments that you make when public support starts to wane. And, you know, as the commander-in-chief -- and Obama still gets pretty decent marks in his capacity as our commander-in-chief. Republicans, actually, I think are encouraged by the fact that General Petraeus is -- is heading to Afghanistan to -- to replace Stan McChrystal.\n\nBut where I think this will get complicated for him -- and where you already see his numbers in Afghanistan sliding -- is when he starts talking about timetables, when they promise to pull troops out. It deflates the morale of the men and women of the military, and it makes the public -- you know, the public is very smart, voters are very smart, and when they hear them talk out of both sides of their mouth, that's where the politics of the war and the responsibilities, the solemn responsibilities as commander-in-chief collide.\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about the roundtable -- I mean, the timetable, Clarence, on the roundtable...\n\nPAGE: Right.\n\nTAPPER: ... which is, for the first time, we've had the vice president say that when he told Jon Alter in that book that a lot of troops leaving in July 2011, he said it could be as few as 2,000.\n\nPAGE: Yes, we're hearing these little rollbacks in the rhetoric all around, insofar as how much of a pullout we're going have next year. And, you know, as the administration has said again and again, it's only the beginning of the -- of the drawdown that they're shooting for, and the president says it's contingent on conditions.\n\nBut nevertheless, any effort you make to establish security and to build internal security in Afghanistan and unify that country is nation-building because of the state of Afghanistan. It has always been a very divided collection of thousands of tribes and -- and various homelands. And General Petraeus is trying valiantly to organize all of that.\n\nBut that's nation-building; I agree with George. The problem for Obama is his own base remembers that this was the good war we weren't supposed to get bogged down in. And he has become more ambitious in his goals.\n\nTAPPER: And, Dee Dee, if in July 2011 it turns out only 2,000 troops leave Afghanistan, I can't imagine that liberals and progressives are going to be happy about that.\n\nMYERS: Right. I mean, last summer and fall, the president went through an extensive process of thinking through exactly what our strategy in Afghanistan was going to be. He spent hours and hours and hours on it. He came out pretty close to where General Petraeus and the military wanted, which was sending 30,000 additional troops.\n\nAnd he sold that to Congress by pairing it with a deadline, which now -- I thought it was interesting to hear Vice President Biden talk about that not as much as a deadline but as the beginning of a transition.\n\nBut when the -- the time comes -- and in the discussion leading up to that, if the administration continues to try to finesse that, which they've been doing, I think you're going to see increasingly angry liberals. We've already seen it.\n\nPeople, again, signed onto this plan on the notion that it would be a specific period of time and not a long period of time, that we wouldn't be there for 10 years or 20 years nation-building. And increasingly, I think the language is getting -- is leaving a lot of wiggle room. Things on the ground have not gone as well as we had hoped a year ago.\n\nTAPPER: George, something else the vice president said that I -- you and I talked about. You disagree with his assertion that the Wall Street reform bill that the president will sign this Wednesday will end uncertainty among big business.\n\nWILL: The president -- the vice president was really responding to your point about all this mountain of cash that businesses have that they're not spending, because to invest is to make a wager on the future and they're uncertain about the future.\n\nThe vice president referred to the financial reform bill as another of our gigantic packages, another 2,300-page piece of legislation. I don't know if, as someone said, there are three unintended consequences on every page, but there are enormous rule-makings yet to come, with bureaucracies yet to be invented. It's bound to spread uncertainty, and it's bound to have essentially what we had in the 1930s when the New Deal came to a grinding halt. Capital went on strike, paralyzed by uncertainty.\n\nPAGE: However, there is the public out there saying, what's government going to do to protect us? We did just go through a financial collapse. Some kind of -- and this came after, really, several decades of fewer and fewer regulations, less and less oversight.\n\nWe need some kind of oversight. How many pages would you like, George, 2,300 too many? How about 100 pages? I mean, you've got to have some detail here. And the regulations haven't even been written yet, the various rules and regulations for the day-to-day operation of all this.\n\nBut at least you're going to see some kind of, what, consumer advocacy where it wasn't there before.\n\nWALLACE: You talk to people in finance, and they'll tell you, we got into this crisis because the housing market became overheated. Housing is one of the most regulated industries in this country. Finance collided with an overheated housing market, also one of the most heavily regulated industries in this country. So what did we do? We added more regulations and we increased the political involvement, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\nPAGE: It's regulated, but I was -- I had a broker try to sell me on an interest-only mortgage, because he gets a bonus for selling me on that, for charging me a higher interest.\n\nWALLACE: That'll never happen, because there isn't any more credit, so I think we've taken care of that.\n\nPAGE: Well, it won't happen again now because it's been written out of existence, virtually, by these new regulations, as it should have been out of existence before, and warnings will be out there for people ahead of time.\n\nWALLACE: But even Democrats admit that these regulations will do nothing to protect us from a similar financial collapse.\n\nMYERS: That's not true, Nicolle. I mean, most people think it will help prevent -- it won't completely prevent another financial crisis, but most people think it will help prevent another one and make -- and create some additional tools for managing a crisis should another one occur.\n\nYou know, you can't fight the last war. And so regulating against everything that happened in the last, you know, collapse is -- is -- is sort of short-sided. People said a lot of the same things after, you know, the last round of big regulation after the '29 collapse, and they turned out not to be true.\n\nNow, I do think George is right in -- in -- in the medium term or the short term, as we've gone from the legislative phase to the regulatory phase. There's going to be a couple of years of actually writing these regulations and putting details onto the legislation, and that's going to be a tough time.\n\nBut I think it's encouraging that the markets didn't go crazy on Thursday and Friday in response to this passing. They went crazy in response to the fact that there was lower-than-expected profits on Wall Street.\n\nTAPPER: A lot of people in the White House think that if it weren't for the recession, all the unemployment, people would be paying attention to the fact that this is a big legislative accomplishment. Obviously, not everyone agrees that it's a good accomplishment, but for a president to achieve this, health care reform, the stimulus package, the president deserves credit. Is -- is that true, you think?\n\nMYERS: Yes, I think -- I think it's amazing how much he's been able to do, whether you agree or disagree with the content of these packages. As a legislative accomplishment, these are huge.\n\nBut I think the president and the administration are not getting much credit, and I think the number-one reason, the most important number, and in some ways the only one that matters is 9.5.\n\nYou know, you still have millions of people -- we -- we lost 7 million jobs in the last couple of years. Now, we've gone from losing 750,000 jobs a month in the spring of last year to creating somewhere around 100,000 private-sector jobs a month now. That's a huge turnaround, and the stimulus contributed to that. But unemployment is still 9.5.\n\nWILL: A huge turnaround doesn't explain the cognitive dissonance of this administration. It's campaigning across the country in what it calls \"recovery summer,\" postulate being we're in a recovery, but, they say, we really need another stimulus, because the first two stimuli did not bring us a recovery.\n\nTAPPER: I appreciate the proper Latin. I want to show...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPAGE: It's about time.\n\nTAPPER: I want to show a couple numbers in terms of polling numbers for President Obama that are not positive, the results of a new ABC News-Washington Post poll. On President Obama's handling of the economy, do you approve of President Obama's handling of the economy? Last month, 50 percent approved. This month, 43 percent, a seven-point drop in just one month, mainly among Democrats.\n\nAnd here's the reason why, if you look at this number, this larger chart. As unemployment has gone up, up, up, the president's approval has gone down, down, down.\n\nAnd yet, Nicolle, I want to ask you this: If you look at the poll on the public's confidence in different groups to handle the economy, Obama is 43 percent, a horrible number for him, Democrats in Congress, 32 percent, Republicans in Congress, 26 percent.\n\nWALLACE: OK. Hang on to that 26 and look at this number: 51 percent of the same voters in that poll want Republicans to take control of Congress.\n\nTAPPER: Why?\n\nWALLACE: They don't even trust us, and they want us to take control of Congress.\n\nTAPPER: I know, but...\n\nWALLACE: That is how desperately they want to stop Obama's agenda. Now -- now, I think it's noble for Democrats to defend the expansion of the role of the federal government in our financial system. I think it's noble to defend Obamacare.\n\nBut the truth is, it has ignited a disdain for the expansion of the federal government, and it's not just among Tea Partiers. I know there's a lot of attention paid to them. The ABC-Post poll has 40 percent of respondents identifying themselves as independents. That is the former Obama coalition.\n\nTAPPER: George?\n\nWILL: Well, I think that's absolutely right. The country is not saying we like Republicans; they're saying we don't like the current agenda. And the Republicans are standing there. They are the alternative.\n\nPAGE: This is the funny thing about this -- you talk about cognitive dissonance. We have a public in the midst of high unemployment that wants less spending. That was not predicted by this administration, and certainly it runs counter to what -- to what liberals normally call for, certainly counter to what worked for FDR. We can talk about what happened during the Great Depression, George.\n\nBut the fact is that -- that I think, if unemployment weren't so bad right now, people would feel a lot better about Obamacare and the stimulus packages, et cetera, but the problem, as long as unemployment is up, the public isn't going to appreciate the president's handling of the economy.\n\nWILL: The false liberal assumption is that economic hard times move the country to the left. It's not true, and it didn't happen in the 1930s. Before the '36 election and after the '36 election, in which Roosevelt carried 46 of 48 states, Democrats said they wanted him to be more conservative, and only about 18 percent of Democrats said they wanted to increase spending. Those are Democrats.\n\nPAGE: Being as they were enjoying the benefits of Social Security and those other programs that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Ronald -- Ronald Reagan, too, found himself with low approval ratings, and -- and a tough economy.\n\nTAPPER: His numbers track -- you and I were talking about this...\n\nWALLACE: With Obama.\n\nTAPPER: His numbers track with Obama's very closely.\n\nWALLACE: But he did the opposite. He crafted an agenda that -- that so appealed to the political center that it created an entire new class of voters, the Reagan Democrats. Obama has gone the opposite direction and seems only interested in expanding government, increasing its role in people's lives, and -- and, you know, I think will have the opposite impact that Reagan's did.\n\nTAPPER: You know, Nicolle, you talked about the Tea Partiers, and that gives me an opportunity to change the subject to something else that happened this week that was very interesting. The NAACP had its convention, and they passed a resolution, one they have not yet released to the public, that condemns racism among the Tea Party movement. And here is an interview with NAACP President Ben Jealous.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEALOUS: Tea Party members have called congressmen the n-word, have called congressmen the f-word. We've seen them carry racial signs. And whenever it happens, the membership tries to shirk responsibility. If the Tea Party wants to be respected and wants to be part of the mainstream in this country, they have to act in a responsible way.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Clarence, why did the NAACP spend so much time or at least get so much attention for condemning the Tea Party movement? Is this an important priority for them?\n\nPAGE: Rightly or wrongly, they are voicing the sentiments that a lot of African-Americans feel and the liberal establishment, if you will. And we can debate over whether or not congressmen really were called the n-word or not. It's a he said\/he said dispute.\n\nBut what's more fundamentally important, Jake, is a year ago we were talking about, is the NAACP still relevant when you've got a black president? Now the NAACP is on page one leading the domestic discussion this week. This is probably the most talked-about issue of the week.\n\nAnd they are diametrically opposed to the Tea Party in virtually every way, demographically, philosophically, et cetera. It makes sense that they would be in dispute. But this is all being played out on talk shows like this one, and I think we're doing a very good job of it.\n\nWILL: Precisely. There's nothing like name-calling and a kind of left-wing McCarthyism to enable the NAACP to make a desperate lunge for its vanished relevance. You say that this episode that he's talking about and the vice president made an oblique reference to it is he said\/he said, whether or not the n-word was used. It's a he said and four television cameras monitoring that event say it didn't happen.\n\nPAGE: A lot of noise. People were yelling things of all kinds, so...\n\nWILL: A talk radio host in this country has offered $100,000 to anyone who can produce a shred of evidence that it happened.\n\nPAGE: Right.\n\nWILL: A hundred thousand dollars still on the table.\n\nPAGE: Well, that's only one of many issues. Look at -- look at the signs. Look at the statements that have been made. Look at -- look at the blatant racial insensitivities, some of it on both sides, you know, but the fact of matter is that we do have the modern version of what you and I remember as white backlash back in the '60s, George, you know, the hard hats, et cetera. After the civil rights revolution, you had a white backlash, or what was called that, and they said, well, it's more than just race, same thing now. It's more than just race. We are talking about deficits and big spending and all, but there is a backlash against Obama's election. And -- and that, some people say, looks racist.\n\nTAPPER: They -- what the vice president said was that he didn't think the Tea Party movement was racist, but that there were racist elements of it. And I think anybody who watches the parades, sees the photographs can -- can say that there are certainly individuals who are part of the movement who say things that are racist.\n\nAnd, in fact, Tea Party organizers Jenny Beth Martin and Mark Meckler wrote this op-ed in Politico in which they said, \"Like all movements, the Tea Party has its fringe. President Barack Obama's domestic terrorist friends from the 1960s anti-war past never represented the Americans of good conscience who opposed the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, the racist posters of a few at a Tea Party rally do not represent the feelings or behavior of Americans who believe in this movement. At Tea Party Patriots, we will continue to condemn the fringe elements of the movement and any expression of racism or bigotry. We sincerely hope that the Obama While House, the NAACP, and the liberal left will follow our lead and do the same in their own ranks.\"\n\nBut that is an acknowledgement that they, too, see racism in some of these events.\n\nWALLACE: And a very important one. I -- I don't understand why this one is difficult. I mean, I think it's incumbent -- forget about the leadership of the Tea Party movement. But them aside for a second.\n\nAny member of this powerful, promising and very relevant movement should stand up and condemn anything that you wouldn't want to see your children participate in. And I can't imagine there's any parent in America who would approve of any of the racist signs that show up at any rally.\n\nSo I think this is easy. I don't think this is about the leadership. I don't think this is about waiting for the leaders of your movement. And people say, oh, they're young, it's not clear where the structure -- forget about that. Any individual at a rally where -- where -- where any sign or insinuation of racism appears should condemn it. And it'll only strengthen the movement and make them more relevant.\n\nMYERS: But I agree with everything, except I think there is a role for the leaders. It's not -- why -- where is Dick Armey? Where is Sarah Palin? It's an easy thing to say exactly what you just said. And the members should do it, but so should the leaders, because, you know, there's an op-ed piece in Politico, but most Americans don't hear that or don't know...\n\nTAPPER: Well, Sarah Palin actually condemned the NAACP.\n\nMYERS: Right.\n\nTAPPER: She just denied that there was any racism at all.\n\nMYERS: And I think that's -- I mean, look, that's, on its face, not true. There are elements -- and they're not the core elements, and I don't think the movement is -- is prime facie racist, but there are racist elements, and they should be repudiated. So where are the leaders? It seems like a no-brainer.\n\nPAGE: And what's important here politically is that the Tea Party, like any other political movement, wants to win over those moderates, those swing voters out there, if you will.\n\nMYERS: They should.\n\nPAGE: And if they are an embarrassment to their fellow conservatives, they break their own coalition up, and so this -- this becomes a very relevant thing here. This is not just political correctness as some people want to dismiss it.\n\nMYERS: But I think it's interesting -- and, Clarence, you might want to comment -- we thought that -- or a lot of people -- I don't know if we thought -- but there seem to be people who said the election of Obama meant we were -- achieved a post-racial status in American society, and I think this -- the heat around this discussion this week shows that we're a long way from a post-racial America.\n\nPAGE: I said then we'll be post-racial when we're post-racism, but we still have racism, sexism, et cetera, out there, always will. We're human beings. But this, I think, was a -- was just an awakening of conservatives who were rather shocked for a variety of reasons by Obama's election, not just race. I think that was a minor element, compared to the philosophical swing and -- and just this big cultural shift.\n\nTAPPER: George, we only have 30 seconds, but -- but do the -- the Tea Party leaders that I just read their op-ed, do they have a point in that we demand the conservatives to condemn isms in their side, but not liberals?\n\nWILL: Well, what -- during the many protests against George W. Bush and the pictures of him with a Hitler moustache and the swastikas associated with him, I don't recall -- I may be wrong -- but I don't recall a clamor of denunciation from the Bush's critics.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Now, one thing...\n\nPAGE: I agree with that.\n\nTAPPER: One thing that the roundtable is going to weigh in on in the -- in the -- in the green room episode that's going to be available on abcnews.com is Aaron Sorkin buying the rights to John Edwards' story, so please stay tuned. And also there you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up with PolitiFact to fact-check the show.",

    "text":"Rose Garden\n\n11:00 A.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry we\u2019re running just a little bit behind, but I figured it\u2019s a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden.\n\nToday, members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.\n\nRight now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits \u2013- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -\u2013 a subsidy that they\u2019ve enjoyed year after year for the last century.\n\nThink about that. It\u2019s like hitting the American people twice. You\u2019re already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if these companies can\u2019t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies\u2019 profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we\u2019re giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.\n\nNow, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. That\u2019s why under my administration, we\u2019ve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. We\u2019ve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. We\u2019ve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.\n\nSo the fact is, we\u2019re producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and we\u2019re importing less of it as well. For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -\u2013 for the first time in over a decade.\n\nSo American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, I\u2019m not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, they\u2019ve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think it\u2019s curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies.\n\nInstead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that\u2019s never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings. That\u2019s the future. That\u2019s the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year. As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. That\u2019s not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.\n\nAnd keep in mind, we can\u2019t just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil but we only have 2 percent of the world\u2019s known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but we\u2019d still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. We\u2019d still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because it\u2019s a world market, the fact that we\u2019re doing more here in the United States doesn\u2019t necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies they\u2019re selling that oil on a worldwide market. They\u2019re not keeping it just for us. And that means that if there\u2019s rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up.\n\nThat\u2019s not the future that I want for America. I don\u2019t want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that there\u2019s some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether there\u2019s going to be enough supply. I don\u2019t want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.\n\nI want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And that\u2019s why, as long as I\u2019m President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that we\u2019re going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that\u2019s already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. We\u2019re going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week. We\u2019re going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that you\u2019re in charge of your own energy bills.\n\nWe\u2019re going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. That\u2019s what we need to keep going. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. That\u2019s the choice that we face. And that\u2019s the choice that\u2019s facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren\u2019t needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nAnd as long as I\u2019m President, I\u2019m betting on the future. And as the people I\u2019ve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. That\u2019s what we do as Americans. That\u2019s who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that we\u2019re going to do that again. Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n11:08 A.M. EDT",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I\u2019m Chris Wallace.\n\nKeeping America safe after the terror attack in England. What steps is the government taking this Memorial Day weekend?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJOHN KELLY, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: It's a constant threat and we always have to be vigilant.\n\nWALLACE: We\u2019ll discuss the investigation into the bombing and the response here in the U.S. with the secretary of homeland security, General John Kelly, live, only on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nThen, new reports the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner discussed setting up a secret communications channel between the Trump transitions in the Kremlin. We\u2019ll ask our Sunday panel where this takes the expanding probe into Russian interference.\n\nPlus, President Trump returns from his first trip overseas to a domestic agenda in trouble, from ObamaCare repeal and replace to the budget, some on Capitol Hill wonder whether Congress will pass anything.\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: Yes, definitely dead on arrival.\n\nSEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: This is step backwards. You\u2019re not going to make America great again with this budget.\n\nWALLACE: We\u2019ll break down the president's priorities and prospects with a number two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin, and Republican senator, Dr. Bill Cassidy.\n\nAnd our power player of the week flying high for the Blue Angels.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Boy, is it sweet when we put all that together and get that synergy and you feel that fuzz.\n\nWALLACE: All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And hello again on this Memorial Day weekend from Fox News in Washington.\n\nPresident Trump is back at the White House arriving late last night after a largely successful nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. But he returns to a spreading scandal about links between the Kremlin and some of his current and former advisors, and to a domestic agenda that stalled in Congress.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to all of that this hour, but we begin with terror, that suicide bombing at a concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22, just the first of four savage attacks this week around the world.\n\nJoining us now, the man in charge of keeping America safe, the secretary of homeland security, General John Kelly.\n\nMr. Secretary, welcome to \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nBefore we get to terror, let me ask you about the hot story in Washington now. These revelations about Jared Kushner trying to set up a back channel to the Kremlin, through the Soviet and -- the Russian ambassador. Your reaction to that? Is there anything improper with that?\n\nKELLY: Well, I don't know if it's true or not. I know it\u2019s being -- it's being reported in the press.\n\nWALLACE: It has been confirmed to me the conversation took place.\n\nKELLY: OK. Then I would just tell you, Chris, that I think any channel of communications back or otherwise with a country like Russia is a good thing. I mean, multiple ways to communicate back and forth is a good thing with a country I think, and particularly a country that\u2019s like Russia. So, it doesn\u2019t -- it doesn't bother me.\n\nI mean, you just have to assume, obviously, that what you\u2019re getting is -- may or may not be true, they may be working you. But that's the whole point. I mean, that communication goes into the White House as a data point in terms of discussion. So, I don't see the big deal.\n\nWALLACE: Let me -- you say you don't see a big deal?\n\nKELLY: No, I think any time you have channels of communication with a country, particularly one like Russia, I wouldn\u2019t criticize it.\n\nWALLACE: But you talked about a data point into the White House. This is during the transition.\n\nKELLY: Right.\n\nWALLACE: These were private officials.\n\nKELLY: Right.\n\nWALLACE: We have one president at a time. Does that make a difference?\n\nKELLY: You know, I mean, obviously, during the transition period, the people in transition, the incoming Trump administration is not in a position to do anything to inhibit with the Obama administration literally days before they transitioned out. So, again, as they begin to build relationships, there's nothing wrong with that. As they begin to build their own situational awareness with Russia in this case, I don't see an issue here.\n\nWALLACE: OK. Let's turn to your day job. What's the latest on the Manchester bombing? Have they rolled up the network that was supporting the bombers, and what have you learned from this plot that will help you better protect the U.S. homeland?\n\nKELLY: I mean, I don't know what the -- actually the better way to put it, I can't comment on whether they finish their investigations, or roll -- you know, completed rolling up on the network that we\u2019re dealing with. But I would just say that this is -- yes, I\u2019ve said it many times, it really is a generational struggle. This is one tragedy in line with dozens of other tragedies in the world.\n\nI mean, last week, you had Manchester, you had Egypt, you had Indonesia, you had the Philippines, all ISIS-inspired or ISIS-controlled terrorist attack.\n\nWALLACE: Was there something different about this network and the way this was pulled off that says to you, gee, we've got to up our game?\n\nKELLY: Well, it\u2019s this kind of -- in my view, there's kind of three types of terrorist attacks. The most sophisticated that we look at, that is against aviation, that's the hardest to do but it's the biggest payoff for these people.\n\nThen you have kind of the middle of the road one, which I think this one was. It\u2019s a network. It's hard to do. You have to construct a bomb and all, and then you have kind of the low-end where -- I mean, just as tragic but you have people running people over in trucks, that kind of thing.\n\nBut this is just the way terrorism is today and I think it will be around for many, many years to come. You know, the good news is those officials in the United Kingdom, Europe, around the world are relentless. They are just as relentless in terms of trying to prevent these things as the terrorists aren't trying to create them.\n\nThe good news is, for our country, we have not had an outside the United States terrorist attacks since 9\/11. And that goes to the issue of those that fight our away game, that\u2019s DOD, NSA, CIA, and those that fight the home game. That\u2019s DHS, FBI, local law enforcement.\n\nWALLACE: Let me pick up on this, because part of the story this week was the leak of information about the bomber and the bombing that made its way into the U.S. media, and that set off this exchange.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTHERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I made clear to President Trump that the intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure.\n\nREX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We take full responsibility for that. And we, obviously, regret that that happened.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: How was this kind of sensitive information leaked to \"The New York Times\"? And, General, why is it that whether it's politics or terror, our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement agencies, can't keep a secret?\n\nKELLY: It's outrageous. When I call -- immediately after the attack, I called my counterpart in U.K., offered my condolences. By the way, the third time I\u2019ve offered her, Amber Rudd, my condolences in 120 days. That's how frequent this kind of -- these terrorist attacks are happening.\n\nAnyways, she rightfully and very graciously accepted the condolences and leaned into me on this leak. It's outrageous. I don't know why people do it. It jeopardizes not only investigations, it puts people's lives in jeopardy.\n\nI don't why people do it, but they do. And that's the world we live in.\n\nWALLACE: Let's get to what you're going to try to do to protect the homeland. There are a lot of crowded events in the summer, concerts, sporting events. How do you harden these soft targets like this concert? And do you have new thoughts because this person didn't get into the event, he was outside the event, what do you do about parameters?\n\nKELLY: We -- one of the great things about America, there's many great things but we are a free and open society. And in many -- and I wouldn't change that at all. But that's also one of our vulnerabilities. People can live their lives day in and day out, privacy issues, all of that, it's a good thing. It\u2019s what America is all about. But as I say, that is a vulnerability.\n\nThe good news is to all Americans, I mean, the good news is that local state law enforcement today -- not to even go down the issue of the FBI, DHS -- it's in their DNA now to harden. We are just about as hard as we can be. I don't know if there's a way to prevent these kinds of things in the kind of society we live in.\n\nWALLACE: Let me pick up on that, because I want to play a clip of your testimony before Congress this week. Here it is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKELLY: It's everywhere, and that\u2019s -- you know, that's the nature of this threat that we are dealing with. As horrible as Manchester was, my expectation is we\u2019re going to see a lot more of that kind of attack.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: A lot more of that kind of attack, here in the U.S.?\n\nKELLY: I think we\u2019re relatively -- we have no specific -- we have threats all the time, but no, right now, specific threat. But that goes to the fact that we are over here and not over there.\n\nThe fact is that it's the caliphate is being destroyed, that is Syria and Iraq, there are large numbers of returning fighters, Western Europe, and, you know, in many cases like this guy that did this thing in Manchester, he\u2019s a citizen of the U.K. In this case, he\u2019s a passport holder. I don't if the U.K. had any idea that he was outside -- that he was in Libya, but I think he\u2019s also traveled to other points.\n\nThe point is, they have a real threat and it's growing, it\u2019s metastasized, as fighters come back from the caliphate to be I believe to be more of this kind of thing.\n\nThe good news is, all decent people, all decent governments, and it doesn't matter whether we are politically close to them or not, all governments for the most part are sharing tremendous amounts of information, passport-type information, aviation, travel information. But, you know, people like this are below the radar.\n\nWALLACE: I want to pick up on aviation because you are in the process of making some big decisions on aviation. And I want to do a lightning round, quick questions, quick answers.\n\nAre you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the U.S.?\n\nKELLY: I might. That's a quick answer.\n\nWALLACE: Yes, well, expand a little bit.\n\nKELLY: Well, there\u2019s a real threat. Numerous threats against aviation, that's really the thing that they are obsessed with, the terrorists, the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if it\u2019s a U.S. carrier, particularly if it's full of mostly U.S. folks, people. It's real. You know that I implemented I think on the 21st of March a restriction on large electronic devices in the cabins from ten points of origin.\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nBut there was talk, as you say, about all international flights both into and out of the U.S. When you say you might, when are you going to make that decision and what\u2019s going to determine it?\n\nKELLY: (INAUDIBLE) follow the intelligence. The very, very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world. We're going to, and in the process of defining this, but we are going to raise the bar for generally speaking aviation security much higher than it is now.\n\nSo -- and there\u2019s new technologies down the road, not too far down the road that we will rely on. But it is a real sophisticated threat and I will reserve that decision until we see where it's going.\n\nWALLACE: Another lightning round question, I do need a quick answer here because we\u2019re running of time. The TSA is testing tighter screening of carry-ons, and the idea that people who bring their carry-ons are going to have to unpack them and put food in one bin, and electronics in the another bin, and paper in another bin.\n\nAre you going to spread that nationwide and what\u2019s that going to do to the screening lines?\n\nKELLY: Yes, I mean, the reason we\u2019ve done, TSA, of course, works for me. The reason we've done that is because of -- people trying to avoid the $25 or $50 or whatever it is to check a bag are now stuffing your carry-on bags to the point of, you know -- well, they can't get any more in there. So, the more you stuff in there, the less the TSA professionals that are looking at what's in those bags through the monitors, they can't tell what's in the bags anymore. So, if you put --\n\nWALLACE: So, are you going to do that nationwide?\n\nKELLY: We might, and likely will.\n\nWALLACE: Soon?\n\nKELLY: Well, what we\u2019re doing now is working out the tactics, techniques and procedures, if you will, in a few airports to find out exactly how to do that with the least amount of inconvenience to the traveler.\n\nWALLACE: A couple final questions I want to ask about the travel ban. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling this week continuing the stay on President Trump's revised travel ban -- and I want to put up -- the chief judge called it, the revised travel ban: an executive order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\n\nMr. Secretary, judge after judge has said that this is a Muslim man that violates the Constitution.\n\nKELLY: They are dead wrong.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I mean, you say that, but they are the ones who were --\n\nKELLY: They are wrong. Remember the seven, now six countries? These were the same countries identified by the Obama administration that we should be extra cautious about and backed up, you know, by the United States Congress. That's where those seven countries came from.\n\nThe fact is that in those countries, we have very little ability to actually verify, vet the people that are coming out of those countries. So, what the president and it's not a travel ban, remember. It\u2019s the travel pause. What the president said, for 90 days, we were going to pause in terms of people from those countries coming to the United States that would give me time to look at additional vetting to see --\n\nWALLACE: OK. I want to pick up on that and why you\u2019re even talking about the travel ban, because I want to put some numbers on. Take a look at this.\n\nThe first executive order that was issued on January 27th banned citizens from seven nations from entering the U.S. for 90 days, suspended the refugee program for 120 days, as you say, a pause, while you set up an extreme vetting program. It's now been 121 days since that first order. So, why don't you have the program in place?\n\nKELLY: We are actually implementing it. The irony here is, had it stood, we would have had the 90 days to study. We\u2019re not even studying what would be procedures, because we are enjoined and can't do that. In the meantime --\n\nWALLACE: You can't study extreme vetting?\n\nKELLY: No. We\u2019re -- the irony again is we can't study it, but I\u2019m just guessing, and implementing.\n\nBut we are going to find implement ways to determine who this -- an individual is, and remember, most of these countries have no passports. They have no police. They have no intelligence. Many of the countries in question don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet. The U.N. will tell you it's almost impossible to vet these people from these countries because there are no passports and all the rest of it.\n\nWe have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the United States. Otherwise, we\u2019re guessing. And this president and John Kelly doesn't want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the U.S. population.\n\nWALLACE: Secretary Kelly, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us.\n\nKELLY: Absolutely. Thanks.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, new reports that Jared Kushner attempted to set up a back channel between Russia and the Trump transition. We\u2019ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the expanding Russia probe.\n\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about the continuous leaks in Washington? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Hillary Clinton talking about Richard Nixon in her commencement speech at Wellesley College, but clearly taking a shot at President Trump. By the way, Nixon resigned before he was actually impeached.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group: the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham, Charles Lane of The Washington Post, Gerald Seib from The Wall Street Journal, and National Security Council staffer, Gillian Turner.\n\nAnd just to catch you up, President Trump returns home to reports that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, in December, and that they discussed setting up a secret secure channel between the Trump transition and the Kremlin. That communications link reportedly to be based in a Russian diplomatic facility in Russia.\n\nA source close to the Trump administration tells me the conversation did take place but he says it was the ambassador who proposed the back channel, not Kushner, so the Russian military could talk with Trump advisors about the situation in Syria and the source points out that the secure link was never set up.\n\nSo, with that as a preface, Gerry, your reaction to the Kushner story, and how does this complicate the already complicated investigation of links between the Kremlin and the Trump transition?\n\nGERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, look, I mean, back channels are not unusual, they are not unprecedented. This one might have seemed perfectly innocent. Two problems though with it. One is, this happened during the transition, it seems to violate as you suggested earlier in the show the only one president at a time rule. And the second one is it\u2019s Russia, after a campaign in which the Russian connection to the campaign, the Russian interference in the campaign was a big issue.\n\nAnd I think the fact that it was at a time when people were looking for whether there were going to be signs of special favors for Russia as a result of help they might have given President Trump, then-President-elect Trump during the campaign, that's what makes this a big story, is the context of the conversation as much as the actual content.\n\nWALLACE: Michael, I want to ask you, one, whether it's a big story, and, secondly, about the talk we are hearing, that is just rampant in Washington today about major changes in the White House that they\u2019re going to set up a rapid response operation to deal with all the incoming leaks, that the president has hired at least one criminal defense lawyer and may be process of hiring a team and the staff is urging the president to let the lawyers vet his tweets. I mean, it really does sound like they\u2019re going on a war footing on this.\n\nMICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, I don't know if it's a major story, there are several investigations going on. They probably should be allowed to work their course. It's kind of exhausting reading some of these new stories and trying to figure out what did you read three weeks ago that\u2019s just being recycled, versus what new?\n\nI think it's smart for the administration to try to put this stuff to the side, have, you know, a team that looks at these issues, and another team that looks at a lot of real policy issues, which are closer to the American people. You have the most conservative, exciting budget that's come out in a decade.\n\nWALLACE: We\u2019re going to get to the agenda in the next segment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: I mean, at the very least, it seems dumb.\n\nNEEDHAM: Clearly, the optics of these are awful, and I think that especially when you have people who are new to the political system coming in and getting advice from a guy in Mike Flynn who probably didn't show the best judgment through a lot of this, you know, dumb might be a good word for it. I don\u2019t know. You know, I think Kushner said a couple of weeks ago that he was happy to participate with the Senate investigation. He said he\u2019s happy to participate with this investigation.\n\nYou are at a disadvantage when you are the focus of an investigation and your lawyers are saying, don't participate, don't comment, and everyone else in the country seems more than eager to talk about it. So, I think a little prudence in keeping our mouth shut while we let the investigations play out is probably fair and we\u2019ll see what comes up in them.\n\nWALLACE: You talk about the fact that they're all the stories and sometimes it's hard to remember what you've heard this week and what you heard last week. And this gets to the question of leaks. I asked our staff to put together, let's put it up on the screen, a list of the headlines from just the last two weeks. This is just Sunday two weeks ago until today. And as you can see, there's been a torrent of disclosures from intelligence and law enforcement officials.\n\nGillian, as somebody who worked in the government, have you ever seen anything like this? And, you know, the conservatives talk about a deep state, that there are people embedded in law enforcement and embedded in the intelligence community that are trying to bring this president down. It sure seems like it's true.\n\nGILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: So, to me on the question of leaks, it seems that without a doubt leaks of information today are the number one threat to U.S. national security interest across the globe. And I think for evidence of that, we need look no further than the very public reprimand, we the United States had to endure from Britain earlier this week, in the wake of the Manchester attacks. A reminder that the British-U.S. intelligence cooperation, relationship, is one of the closest that has ever existed. And in my lifetime, in government and policy, I have not seen something so public, so public a risk (ph)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Most of these leaks aren\u2019t about national security. They are about Trump's political security.\n\nTURNER: Yes. And so, this gets to the question of the deep state. So, I\u2019m somebody who likes to push back against the narrative having been a civil servant in the government. Again, in the national security community is different than the political community, the rest of the policy community. But I will say that from I have seen and experienced, it does not exist.\n\nThere is not this liberal --\n\nWALLACE: How do you define this?\n\nTURNER: There isn\u2019t a liberal core of people -- put it this way, Chris, for a hard fact, more than 50 percent of the federal workforce today is made up of people that joined the government prior to President Bush's tenure in office. So, the idea that these are Obama holdovers is simply not true, it's not the case.\n\nI think that when we talk about why individuals leak information, the explanations are as varied as human beings\u2019 psychology. So, for example, a lot of things we are seeing leaked about the president are probably being leaked by his senior staff to hurt one another. That's not unique to the Trump administration.\n\nWALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got some different reactions in this question of leaks.\n\nAdri Ane sent us on Facebook: Do whistleblowers hold a vital role in the health of a democracy holding those in power to accountability?\n\nBut chuck Coo had a different take: Simple question. If our intelligence agencies are as good as advertised, why can't they find the leakers?\n\nChuck, how do you answer both of them about leaks?\n\nCHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, as a member of the press, and is a believer in the role of the media and holding government accountable, I\u2019m not going to come out against leaks, because, you know, for all the leaks that may cause this or that official trouble, there's going to be another one that does play an important role in accountability.\n\nBut going back to what Gillian said, I think part of the reason that these leaks are flowing so uncontrollably to the viewer\u2019s question is the factional struggle within this administration. You know, we have this famous dispute between Bannon and Kushner that supposedly was papered over. But I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, those were present two currents, to put it politely, within the White House that are trying to get bad stories out about one another.\n\nAnd this goes to your point about the staff shakeup and so on and so forth. You can shake up the staff all you want, but if man at the top is not laying out a clear and consistent line, is not himself modeling behavior, for example, by not blowing an Israeli source in a meeting with a foreign government, that sets the tone that this stuff is not really on, then it will continue.\n\nNEEDHAM: I take your point about the responsibility of the press and how leaks play into as it requires a responsible press also. That when James Fallows of The Atlantic today put side-by-side The Washington Post in The New York Times and how they treat, I think it was three unnamed sources in the White House talking about Jared Kushner and his desire to be here and stay here, this is not an urgent story. This is not something that\u2019s getting out there.\n\nI don't think you see in the press, The Times and The Washington Post, the way they are playing this kind of using leakers to try to unearth the truth and taking two months like --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: We need to --\n\nNEEDHAM: It\u2019s kind of getting ridiculous.\n\nWALLACE: We need to -- because we\u2019re going to run out of time. Let me simply say, we're just receiving information. It\u2019s people who had sworn, oftentimes taken legal oaths not to divulge the information, they are the ones putting it out. We\u2019re just the recipients.\n\nAll right. We have to take a break here. We\u2019ll see you a little later.\n\nWhen we come back, Senators Dick Durbin and Bill Cassidy. Is the president's agenda, both his new budget and the new effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare in trouble?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, President Trump releases his budget.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is laying a foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American greatness.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: But does it have any chance of getting through Congress?\n\nTwo key senators join us next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: A look outside the beltway of the Indianapolis Motor speedway, home to this weekend's Indianapolis 500.\n\nBack from his first foreign trip, President Trump's focus will now shift to his domestic agenda, his new budget and a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\n\nJoining us to discuss the president's priorities from Springfield, Illinois, the Senate\u2019s number two Democrat, Dick Durbin. And here in Washington, Louisiana senator and doctor, Bill Cassidy, who\u2019s on both the Senate Finance and Health Committees.\n\nWell, senators, before we get to the Trump agenda, I\u2019ve got to ask you about the big story in Washington. This weekend, the Jared Kushner story, discussions about setting up a possible back channel with Russia.\n\nSenator Durbin, what's wrong with that?\n\nSEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: The bottom line, of course, is we now have a special counsel in Bob Mueller. I have the highest level of confidence in him. And I hope that he will follow all the evidence, all the leads, and all the suggestions. And I\u2019m sure he will.\n\nWALLACE: Do you have any specific comment about the Kushner conversation and whether or je should keep his security clearance?\n\nDURBIN: Well, of course not. I mean this is a rumor at this point and whether it is something that should be followed up on, I\u2019ll trust Bob Mueller's judgment.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Cassidy, are you troubled by this?\n\nSEN. BILL CASSIDY, R-LOUISIANA: I agree with Dick\u2019s assessment. And I\u2019ll say, when you speak to folks back home, voters across the nation, they\u2019re more concerned about their climbing health care premiums and the need to have jobs with better wages and better benefits. This will play out. We will know eventually. Right now Americans need help with their premiums.\n\nWALLACE: Well, you know what then gentlemen, let's switch to health care. And the Congressional Budget Office, non-partisan, released its score of the House bill this week. And let's put the numbers up on the screen. It would reduce the deficit $119 billion over ten years, but 23 million more people would be uninsured by 2026. The cost of insurance, according to the CBO, for a 64-year-old earning $27,000 a year would increase from $1,700 a year under ObamaCare to more than $13,000 under the GOP bill. Here's what Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said this week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, MINORITY LEADER: Unless you\u2019re a healthy millionaire, Trumpcare is a nightmare. This report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the Republican effort to sabotage our health care system.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Senator Cassidy, is Schumer right?\n\nCASSIDY: So the Senate will write its own bill. And it shouldn't be the final coffin because right now there's families sitting around their kitchen table, they\u2019re play $20,000, $30,000 and $40,000 a year for premiums and there's about to be a 40 percent increase in many states in these premiums. Cassidy-Collins, a bill I\u2019ve introduced with Susan Collins, we have four co-sponsors.\n\nWALLACE: Yes, we\u2019re going to get into that in a --\n\nCASSIDY: But that said, actually would -- would -- would meet that family\u2019s needs and I think it should be a place we go and those families are asking us to address those issues.\n\nWALLACE: So -- so what would you say to Americans? How should they regard the House bill?\n\nCASSIDY: The House product, the Senate will have its own product. We will go to conference. But I think the Senate product, I'm hopeful, will be more likely to address their needs.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Durbin, I know what you\u2019re going to say, and the CBO certainly indicates there are problem with repeal and replace, but ObamaCare has its own problems. You heard Senator Cassidy mentioned some of them. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City just announced this week that it has lost $100 million through 2016 and that it is going to pull out of exchanges. That means that in 25 counties in western Missouri they may have no insurer at all. Doesn\u2019t something have to be done dramatically?\n\nDURBIN: Well, it should be. But first we ought to have an administration that supports our health care system. What the Trump administration has done since day one is to find ways to cut off support for our current health care system, lack of advertising, for example, to bring new people on board so we have larger insurance pools and lower premiums. We have to have an effort made to sustain the current system while we repair it. We shouldn\u2019t be sabotaging it.\n\nWALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, senator --\n\nDURBIN: But let\u2019s look at the bottom line here. What the Republicans --\n\nWALLACE: Senator Durbin, let me just point out, when Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City says they\u2019ve lost $100 million in 2016, you can't blame that on Trump. He wasn't president.\n\nDURBIN: No, of course it is not a situation where the system we have is perfect, and it isn't. I voted for it. And it needs to be repaired. And I think Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins are at least willing to sit down in a constructive fashion and deal with that. Bill and I have had conversations about that. I'm sorry that the two of them are not in the room with the 13 apostles that Senator McConnell\u2019s chosen to come up with the Republicans plan. I wish Bill and Susan were in there.\n\nWALLACE: All right, let -- let -- let me bring Senator Cassidy back, because let's talk about the Collins, Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, and Cassidy plan. And here are some of the highlights of that plan. Keep most ObamaCare taxes to pay for a replacement instead of an individual mandate. That would end. Auto enroll people in insurance so they have to opt out, not opt in. And let states keep most of ObamaCare if they want.\n\nSenator, it's a very interesting plan, but I don't have to tell you there are some of your more conservative colleagues in the Senate who are never going to go for this because they\u2019re --\n\nCASSIDY: That\u2019s --\n\nWALLACE: I mean they\u2019re already upset that they say the House plane leaves too much of ObamaCare in place. You're leaving more of it in place.\n\nCASSIDY: A couple things. It is the conservative solution. The conservative thinks the power should return to individuals and to states. We do that. The power that ObamaCare gave, took from states, we give back. And you can't say you\u2019re a conservative and we believe in states\u2019 rights, and then tell states what they can't do. If a blue state wishes to do a blue thing, God bless them.\n\nAnd as regard to taxes, it isn't so much that we have to keep these taxes. As a fiscal conservative, I do think we need to pay for things. We have to balance our budget. We just say those taxes should be addressed in comprehensive tax reform, not piecemealed beforehand. I will repeat, the Cassidy-Collins plan is the conservative solution.\n\nWALLACE: But have you gotten any buy-in, and let me just take a few names, from Ted Cruz, from Rand Paul, from Mike Lee? And what are the chances, honestly, that the Senate won't pass anything, that this health care reform is going to die?\n\nCASSIDY: I can't speak for those senators you listed. I will say that between -- aside from Susan and I, there\u2019s four other Republicans who support it. Now what would really be --\n\nWALLACE: That\u2019s six. You need 44 more.\n\nCASSIDY: But of all the plants out there, we\u2019re the one that have the most support. And there are others who are very much interested. But I\u2019ll also say to my friend Dick Durbin, if we had Democrats involved, because we do allow a blue state to do a blue thing. That\u2019s states\u2019 rights. That if they can\u2019t -- if we had 25 Democrats and 40 Republicans, it wouldn't be a Republican plan, it wouldn't be a Democratic plan, it would be an American plan.\n\nWALLACE: OK, let me quickly -- because I want to get to the budget briefly. But -- but, real quickly, Senator Durbin, any Democratic buy-in?\n\nDURBIN: As long as we take repeal off the table, there are a lot of Democrats who want to bring a chair to the table. I'm one of them. Let\u2019s sit down together with Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins. I don't agree with their -- many aspects of their start-up plan, but it's a good faith effort to do two things, reduce the cost of health insurance and expand the reach of health insurance. That should be our national goal.\n\nWALLACE: All right, now there's the Trump budget that was released this week, and let's go through some of the highlights of that. Here are some of the key increases in spending. For the military, increase by 10.1 percent, border security by 6.8 percent, but EPA is cut 31.4 percent, the State Department by 29.1 percent, and NIH, the National Institutes of Health, by 18.2 percent. Here's how Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney explained it.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation. Yes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Senator Durbin, I know you\u2019re going to bash the Trump budget, but -- but don't we have to cut spending at some point? Are we just going to keep piling up the national debt?\n\nDURBIN: Well, that's a very -- very important question that you asked, Chris, but the question is, where you cut it and how you cut. I do not believe you make America great again by cutting medical research to the lowest level in 12 years. I don't think you make America great again by saying to working families, it's now more expensive for your kids to borrow money for student loans. You certainly don't make us a great nation by cutting back in infrastructure. All those three things are in the Trump budget. So if we\u2019re going to have priorities, let's look at the things that are important for building jobs and opportunity in the future.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Cassidy, how dead -- I know it's dead -- but how dead is the Trump budget?\n\nCASSIDY: So class -- typically, in fact, always, the Senate and the House write their own budget, but it does reflect the president's goals. I actually agree with those goals, but would take a different approach. Let\u2019s speak of Medicaid, which under their budget is cut. Medicaid is unsustainable, both for states and for the federal government. It has to be reformed. But as a physician who worked with Medicaid patients, I know that benefit has to also be preserved. I've actually worked on legislation that would bend the cost curve, at the same time reform it so that states would not go bankrupt trying to continue their Medicaid program.\n\nWALLACE: But --\n\nCASSIDY: We have elements of that in the Cassidy-Collins plan. We share the goal, we just have a different way to get there.\n\nWALLACE: But just real quickly, though. I know you\u2019re concerned about the Gulf Coast and Louisiana. Are you OK with cutting EPA? You\u2019re a doctor. Are you OK with these kinds of big cuts in NIH?\n\nCASSIDY: Again, I think the best way to control future health care spending is to find that cure for Alzheimer's. I agree with the goal. I have a different approach. If we find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s, which postpones or heals, then those folks are not taking a trillion dollars out of our economy with their illness. Rather they are contributing, that capital is used for something else. We can actually get at this in a different light.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Cassidy, Senator Durbin, I want to thank you both for coming in and thank you for your time, especially in this holiday weekend.\n\nCASSIDY: Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, President Trump wraps up his first foreign trip, but his troubles here at home haven't gone away. Our panel comes back to discuss both.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We made extraordinary gains on this historic trip to advance the security and prosperity of the United States, our friends and our allies.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump at the end of his first foreign trip giving himself good reviews, which is what presidents always do.\n\nAnd we\u2019re back now with the panel.\n\nGillian, how do you think the president did on this trip and why do you think he seemed to get along so much better with the leaders in the Middle East than he did with our allies in Europe?\n\nTURNER: So I really divide the trip into two parts conceptually. It\u2019s helpful. So the first is really going around and touching on major worlds -- the world\u2019s major three religions, excuse me, Chris, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. And I think that that part of the trip went relatively well. We had some pushback from the media about certain protocol optics, like, you know, like what was donning the heads of Melania and Ivanka Trump. That's fine.\n\nI think the second part of the trip was really NATO-focused. And there the president\u2019s speech actually got a lot of criticism. But I think for the first time the administration cabinet-wide is actually striking the right tone on NATO, by which I mean they\u2019re focusing on recommitting themselves to the importance of the alliance and they backtracked, or progressed, however you want to phrase it, on the -- the idea that it's become obsolete, which is a good thing for everyone.\n\nAt the same time, they\u2019re encouraging the member nations to contribute 2 percent GDP, which at this time -- remember, this was part of the president\u2019s campaign platform. So I think he's got a mandate from the American people to push for that and it's something he's doing. I think it's a nice balance.\n\nWALLACE: We should point out that the first part of the trip, especially the Saudi part of the trip, was largely organized by Jared Kushner, and people who support him say he was talking to all of those Saudi leaders and helping -- and Sunni Muslim leaders during the transition, and that's one of the reasons it was such a success.\n\nChuck, what struck you about these nine days?\n\nLANE: I have to say, the chilly atmospherics of the Europe portion of the trip, in contrast to the warmth, the abundant good feeling that was on display in Saudi Arabia between the president and the royal family of Saudi Arabia, that -- that contrast I think spoke volumes. It's true that he's -- the president got a lot of criticism for not uttering the words I personally support Article Five, the mutual defense guarantee in NATO --\n\nWALLACE: Attack on one is an attack on all.\n\nLANE: Correct. But the reason for -- another president with another history, who had run a different campaign, that wouldn't be an issue. The Europeans feel very embattled and nervous with respect to the Trump administration. He supported Brexit. He openly spoke warmly about Marine Le Pen. He\u2019s called NATO obsolete. And they were looking for some -- the kind of reassurance that he gave the Saudis, and they didn't get it. And I think that will have repercussions going forward.\n\nWALLACE: Let's talk about the domestic side, because the president returns to a Congress that is addley (ph) divided about repeal and replace and has already, both Republicans and Democrats, rejected his budget that we were just talking about with the two senators.\n\nMichael, some Senate Republicans are talking about just giving up on health care and moving straight tax reform.\n\nNEEDHAM: It would be a mistake. I mean the American health care system is collapsing under ObamaCare. But part of the reason that this agenda is so complicated and that we need a real sense of urgency on both the White House and the Congress about health care, tax reform, the budget, the debt limit, all this stuff that\u2019s coming up and how it fits together is that for seven years the Republican Party has told itself a lie, that we are all united on wanting the same ends, that we all want to repeal ObamaCare, it\u2019s about what the replace is. And what you actually have is you have very legitimate and heartfelt disagreement within the party about what the best path forward is.\n\nSome conservatives who want to focus on Title One regulations. Bill Cassidy, who has his plan, the Tuesday Group in the House, which is more of a force --\n\nWALLACE: More moderate.\n\nNEEDHAM: The moderate group. Kind of a force for the status quo. I think the healthiest thing that\u2019s happened in the last couple of months is that in the House, for the first time, leadership and the members themselves acknowledge that there are real differences of policy in this party. This isn't good guys and bad guys. It isn\u2019t disagreements about tactics. They sat down for a couple of weeks. They understood where they were coming from. And they came up with a coalition form of government that said, you know what, let's let the state decides. If they want to wave out of ObamaCare, that's fine for some of them and others don\u2019t.\n\nWALLACE: But -- but --\n\nNEEDHAM: That's the model that needs -- that needs to happen going forward to bring them together.\n\nWALLACE: But -- but the problem, of course, with that, as you just heard from Bill Cassidy is, he\u2019s saying they\u2019re basically going to put that over the side, maybe they\u2019ll take a little bit out of it, but they\u2019re going to write their own bill.\n\nGerry, is it possible that we could get to the end of 2017, this year, and that a Republican-controlled Congress, Republican control of the House and the Senate, will not have passed a single major Trump legislative initiative? And if so, what does that mean for prospects for Republicans in the 2018 midterms?\n\nSEIB: Well, it is -- first of all, it is possible because we\u2019re staring down the path here of no easy wins. You know, no big, easy wins.\n\nBy the way, there's one other that you shouldn't forget, which is by the fall, this Congress has to raise the debt ceiling, which everybody hates to do and -- and --\n\nWALLACE: You\u2019ve also got to fund the government.\n\nSEIB: You have to fund the government, have to raise the debt ceiling. They\u2019re going to have to get Republican votes. Conservatives hate raising the debt ceiling. Everybody hates raising the debt ceiling. That has to happen as well. So you have a whole series of tough or unpleasant choices before the Congress.\n\nMy guess is that, in the end, I think a Republican Congress will figure out a way to get together and get some of these things done, even in a truncated form because it\u2019s too heavy a lift to go through an entire year in full control of the government and not have anything to show for it.\n\nWALLACE: You think they pass tax -- health care reform or do you think they\u2019re going to end up eventually realizing -- you had Mitch McConnell say, I don't see how we get to 50.\n\nSEIB: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: Which is not the kind of thing he openly says. Do you think that they could just punt on that and go to tax reform?\n\nSEIB: I think they could easily walk past health and go to tax reform. I -- Mitch McConnell\u2019s a smart guy. He\u2019s not going to move down a path unless he knows there\u2019s success at the end of that path. And if he doesn't, you know, that's because there is no way to get 50 votes plus one.\n\nI do think tax reform is something that Republicans really want to do. They\u2019ve come to Washington to cut taxes. They\u2019re not going to walk out of this town I think in December without having given that at least a really good try.\n\nWALLACE: Michael?\n\nNEEDHAM: Yes. No, I think, you know, they need to do both and all of these things are intertwined. At some point they have to sit down and look at these various points, the debt limit, spending, tax reform, health care, and define which wings of the party, which different factions within the parties will get what wins where. And once they do that, they\u2019ll get some.\n\nThe other thing that has to be considered this week is, is the Paris Accords, Paris Climate treaty, and what makes that so complicated, I think, for the president is it\u2019s non-binding. I think he\u2019s actually going to come out this week and pull out the Paris Accords. He made an explicit promise on the campaign trail. He\u2019s somebody who likes to keep his promises. And, second, the United States shouldn't stay in a treaty just because it's non-binding. If we don\u2019t intend on participating, we should pull out. I think the president will do that.\n\nWALLACE: All right, we have to leave here. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.\n\nUp next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" the Blue Angels, flying high and inspiring pride.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Soldiers placing flags by the 230,000 grave markers at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPride, professionalism, precision, those are the watchwords of this military unit. And on this special weekend, that unit is our \"Power Player of the Week.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nRYAN BERNACCHI, BLUE ANGELS COMMANDING OFFICER: We\u2019re focused on that very precise control of the airplane and flying it to the very best of your ability and you\u2019re thinking out ahead, OK, what's next, and what's next, and what\u2019s next.\n\nWALLACE (voice-over): Ryan Bernacchi is commander of the Blue Angels, the Navy's precision flight squadron. He's in the number one jet, leading his team through intricate maneuvers at up to 700 miles per hour, with the planes sometimes just 18 inches apart. The Blue Angels were in the area to perform at the U.S. Naval Academy, and we got to go inside their operation.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): Is there a lot of talking going on while you\u2019re up in the air?\n\nBERNACCHI: There is a lot of talking. As the leader, I\u2019m calling acadence (ph) for every -- every turn, every pull, every power change. And we\u2019re just going to turn left, it's as simple as, coming left. And on that go, all six sticks will move in unison. Coming further left, a little, pull.\n\n(INAUDIBLE).\n\nAnd when all that gets going, we call it -- we call it fuzz -- it gets fuzzy because it will -- it will just take on this rhythm. You\u2019re feeling the fuzz, Chris. Yes.\n\nWALLACE: I'm feeling the fuzz!\n\nBERNACCHI: Yes. It\u2019s something -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it's crisp, but it's -- it\u2019s electric.\n\nWALLACE (voice-over): Admiral Chester Nimitz started the Blue Angels in 1946 with F-6 Hellcat prop planes to keep up interest in naval aviation after World War II. Now they fly F-18 Hornets, in dozens of shows each year for more than 11 million spectators, from a cloudy naval academy, to a crystal clear San Francisco Bay.\n\nBERNACCHI: I always was going to be a pilot.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): Why?\n\nBERNACCHI: The Blue Angels.\n\nWALLACE (voice-over): Bernacchi used to go with his dad to shows in the bay area every summer.\n\nBERNACCHI: I was that kid and I wanted to fly.\n\nWALLACE: Now he has a nickname.\n\nBERNACCHI: They call the flight leader \"boss.\" Wingmen will talk to me and, hey, boss, you know, and that\u2019s the way it -- it works. And then we -- we do it on the ground as well.\n\nWALLACE: At the end of the show, the Blue Angels do a maneuver called a loop, break, cross. All six planes headed straight up, then, in six different directions, and then back to the center point.\n\nBERNACCHI: At about 800 knots of closure. So just under 1,000 miles an hour. And, boy, is it -- is it sweet when we put all that together. That -- that synergy and you feel that fuzz and you get it -- you get it going and -- and that's really, really -- it's -- it\u2019s sweet, but it's very, very intense.\n\nWALLACE: Bernacchi, who\u2019s flown combat over Iraq and Afghanistan, compares it to operating off an aircraft carrier and he says that's the mission of the Blue Angels, to represent their fellow service members who are on the front lines.\n\nBERNACCHI: It's about the Navy Marine Corps, they\u2019re forward deployed, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re providing us with our freedom. And that\u2019s the real work. We makes people feel something, and -- and it's that pride. It's the pride this country has in our sailors and Marines and we just bring it and display it in a way that people can connect with and they can -- they can see and feel and touch. And that, I think, is the value of the Blue Angels.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: Blue Angels will be traveling the country this summer. If you get a chance to see them in action, it's something you will never forget.\n\nAnd that's it for today. We hope you\u2019ll take a moment this weekend to remember all the men and women who have given their lives defending our freedom.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll see you next \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

    "text":"Roosevelt Room\n\n11:27 A.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for being here today. It\u2019s a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law. Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a healthcare plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone.\n\nYou represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digits and even triple digits. In Arizona, the rates were over 116 percent last year -- 116 percent increase. And the deductibles are so high you don\u2019t even get to use it.\n\nMany Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left. The insurance companies are fleeing. They\u2019re gone; so many gone. The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost. Americans should pick the plan they want. Now they\u2019ll be able to pick the plan they want, they\u2019ll be able to pick the doctor they want. They\u2019ll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave. You don\u2019t pick your doctor, you don\u2019t pick your plan -- you remember that one.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to have one-size-fits-all. Instead, we\u2019re going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business. And you\u2019ll see rates go down, down, down, and you\u2019ll see plans go up, up, up. You\u2019ll have a lot of choices.\n\nYou\u2019ll have plans that nobody is even thinking of today. They will have plans that today nobody has even thought about, because the market is going to enforce that, with millions and millions of people wanting healthcare. More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down very significantly. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there, because you have to let that marketplace kick in, and it\u2019s going to take a little while to get there. Once it does, it\u2019s going to be a thing of beauty. I wish it didn\u2019t take a year or two years, but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and that\u2019s the way it works. But we\u2019re willing to go through that process.\n\nWorking together, we\u2019ll get the job done. And I have to say this just in closing, and then I want to hear some of your stories, and we\u2019ll let the press stay for your stories if you like. But the press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden. I\u2019m watching the news -- looks so good. They\u2019re showing these reports about \"this one gets so much and this one gets so much.\"\n\nFirst of all, it covers very few people. And it\u2019s imploding. And \u201917 will be the worst year. And I said it once, I\u2019ll say it again -- because Obama is gone -- things are going to be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare. They\u2019re going to have tremendous increases.\n\nAnd the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position -- and I tell this to Tom Price all the time -- by repealing Obamacare -- because people aren\u2019t going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare. They\u2019re not going to see the devastation in \u201917 and \u201918 and \u201919. It'll be gone by then, whether we do it or not. It\u2019ll be imploded off the map.\n\nSo the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we end it, everyone is going to say, \"Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be, remember how wonderful it used to be, it was so great.\" It\u2019s a little bit like President Obama. When he left, people liked him. When he was here, people didn\u2019t like him so much. That\u2019s the way life goes. That\u2019s human nature.\n\nThe fact is, Obamacare is a disaster. And I say this to the Republicans all the time: By repealing it, by getting rid of it, by ending it, everyone is going to say, \"Oh, it used to be so great.\" But it wasn\u2019t great. And I tell Tom Price and I tell Paul Ryan, I tell everyone of them -- I say, the best thing you can do politically is wait a year, because it\u2019s going to blow itself off the map. But that\u2019s the wrong thing to do for the country, it\u2019s the wrong thing to do for our citizens.\n\nSo with that, I\u2019d like to introduce some of the folks and you could say a few words about your experience with Obamacare. And perhaps the press will even report it. (Laughter.)\n\nWould you like to start?\n\nMS. COUEY: Yeah, thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nMS. COUEY: Our rates are three times what they were before Obamacare started. We have one provider in our county. We have very little options for what we can and cannot do. We\u2019re a small-business owner; we\u2019re actually not a brick-and-mortar, we are cattle ranchers. We can\u2019t afford our equipment if we\u2019re paying these rates year after year after year.\n\nOur food source is in jeopardy because of this healthcare law. It\u2019s my basic --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I know. Sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry. This is what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s gone up three times, and then you have to pay -- if you don\u2019t want to use it, you have to pay. That\u2019s the all-time beauty. If you don\u2019t want to use it, you have to pay. And, Tom, you have to pay big league, right? Some people say, well, if I use it, I use it, I\u2019m paying too much. If I don\u2019t use it, I have to pay a penalty. And do you have to pay penalties? Do you ever do that, or you have to --\n\nMS. COUEY: We haven\u2019t as of yet, but we were uninsured in December. They dropped us for the fourth time, after we paid over $50,000 last year for healthcare expenses.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And it\u2019s gone up triple.\n\nMS. COUEY: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And before Obamacare, you actually had good healthcare.\n\nMS. COUEY: We did. We had a fantastic plan.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A lot of people -- nobody ever takes that into account. I\u2019m not saying the system before was good, because it wasn\u2019t, but millions of people had great healthcare that they loved.\n\nNow, when you start deducting those millions of people from the so-called people that are happy, you have a very small number of people that are happy. That, I can tell you.\n\nHow about you?\n\nPARTICIPANT: Well, we\u2019re kind of the same story as Carrie. In 2009, I left a full-time job to be a stay-at-home mom to two kids. For our family, it was never an option to get government assistance; we just don\u2019t believe our neighbors should work harder so that we don\u2019t have to. So my husband said, if you can pay for our insurance -- which at the time was $650 a month for private health insurance for a family of four -- then that was fine.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2015, that private insurance went up by 102 percent. Finally, his employer told us in 2015, when it went up the final time an additional 34 percent, that they couldn\u2019t carry our family anymore, so I had to enter back into the workforce but I couldn\u2019t find a job that offered health insurance. So we entered under Obamacare, and we believed the sales pitch that, \"If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\"\n\nSo even though we were going to have to pay $1,300 a month for Obamacare, we thought we\u2019d still be okay with our doctors. We were on it for five months. Our pediatrician for our children wouldn\u2019t take it, my doctor wouldn\u2019t take it, so we paid them $8,000 in five months and were never able to use it.\n\nAnd I think what makes our family story unique is, we\u2019re by no means wealthy. In 2014, when we entered the exchange, we made $53,000 as a family, my husband and I together -- that was our gross income. And then in 2015, we made together -- since I had gone back to work -- $74,000. But when you look at paying $10,000 in health premiums and insurance -- and health costs --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So it\u2019s been a rough go.\n\nPARTICIPANT: It has, it\u2019s been hard.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How have you found Obamacare?\n\nPARTICIPANT: We\u2019ll be so happy to see it gone. I mean, it\u2019s almost put our family in financial ruin, and I think that\u2019s the story for a lot of people.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s put businesses in financial ruin.\n\nPARTICIPANT: That\u2019s right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s one of the biggest costs -- it has been disastrous for businesses.\n\nGo ahead, sir.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Yes, first of all, Mr. President, thank you for having us here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nMR. SEIFE: I think it\u2019s a great opportunity to talk to the American people, people like ourselves that have struggled with the healthcare law.\n\nI myself am from Miami. I haven\u2019t had very much time to prepare, but the President of the United States calls and I\u2019m here. (Laughter.) So it just so happened I had -- every single year for the past couple of years I\u2019ve had a different insurance every single year. Before, I had an individual plan, my wife and I -- my wife is an attorney, I\u2019m a computer programmer; I\u2019m a small business, my wife is a small business. And I just don\u2019t understand what happened. I have a daughter with a disability. We\u2019ve changed our plan every year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So your insurance was good before Obamacare.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Oh, absolutely. I never had --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Many people are like that. Many, many plans were great before Obamacare. They were so happy. And that doesn\u2019t justify the system before Obamacare, but people are miserable now, and it\u2019s putting people out of business and it\u2019s putting them in the poorhouse.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nMR. SEIFE: It\u2019s just that we had to -- they cancelled our plans, and I couldn\u2019t understand why they cancelled our plans. So we had no other choice. I remember the President of the United States say that individual plans will not be covered, you need to have an employer-based plan. I do not work for the government, I do not work for a large employer.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Very unfair.\n\nMR. SEIFE: We are ground zero. My case is ground zero for the healthcare law.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you represent a lot of people in the same situation.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Absolutely.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s very unfair.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Like my friend here, she\u2019s in the same situation. And I think it\u2019s very, very unfair. And I think that the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode, like you were saying. And my parents are from -- came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about. So I know what socialism is, and that\u2019s pretty much what -- this whole system was meant to have one single provider.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it turns out it's so expensive it\u2019s almost not socialism when you think about it. (Laughter.) You have to pay so much.\n\nWhat do you think? Go ahead.\n\nMS. SERTICH: I\u2019m from Arizona, and I can tell you that the 116-percent increase is real, it\u2019s not a myth. I lost my plan three times during the Obamacare era. After losing it this year I decided to opt out. So right now I do not have traditional healthcare.\n\nAnd I went from a $365-a-month premium last year to a $809-premium this year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And a higher deductible.\n\nMS. SERTICH: The deductible was going to be $6,800, no copays. So if I went to the doctor, I would be paying out of my pocket, and it just didn\u2019t seem like a good use of my money. I thought I would be a better steward of that $17,000 at the end of the year should I have reached my deductible, and just decided to opt out. I went into a faith-based share program, and I\u2019m doing that.\n\nOne of the reasons I felt like I can do this -- totally taking a leap of faith -- is because I think -- I know you\u2019re going to get this taken care of. So I thought it\u2019s only going to be for a year. I will be on this program, I will opt out of traditional healthcare, or health insurance. And I think you\u2019re going to get it done.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You have a lot of people in Arizona paying a big penalty?\n\nMS. SERTICH: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re paying the penalty?\n\nMS. SERTICH: Well, and my husband also owns his own business and can\u2019t afford to offer insurance to employees. And his employees who are also in the independent market, it\u2019s just getting too much. And I\u2019ve had individual insurance for 25 years, since I started my business. So I\u2019ve always been in that individual market, I\u2019ve always done what was right. I took responsibility for myself, made sure I was covered for healthcare because I\u2019m a businessperson, I don\u2019t want any huge healthcare expenses to affect the money that could be going to my business now having to go to a health expense.\n\nSo I was in my mid-20s when I said, you know what, I\u2019ve got to get -- we\u2019ve got to get square with this, I have to have independent insurance. So, I have.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. The people of Arizona have been hit very, very hard. At least 116 percent. Here\u2019s the bad news: It\u2019s going to go up more this year. Now, if we repeal it, nobody is going to know that, and the press is going to say how wonderful it was, and, gee, we miss Obamacare. That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s the biggest problem I have, Tom. We\u2019re going to do them a big favor, but it\u2019s not the right way.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nMR. BROWN: Mr. President, thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Louis.\n\nMR. BROWN: My name is Louis Brown. I work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. I'm an attorney by trade. In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was going through Congress -- what became the Affordable Care Act -- I was working for the Democratic National Committee at the time. I resigned my position because I could tell that the Democratic bill that was going through Congress wanted to publicly fund abortion, and that\u2019s not something that I could go along with. So I resigned my position, later worked for Congressman Dan Lungren in Congress, and went on to eventually work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. And we\u2019re focused on building a culture of life, protecting religious liberty in healthcare, protecting the right of conscience, prohibiting the public funding of abortion, and also prohibiting non-discrimination against pro-life medical providers.\n\nEspecially as an African American, I'm a graduate of Howard University School of Law.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good school.\n\nMR. BROWN: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. And I know from Saint John Paul II -- he said that all of our human and civil rights that we believe in as Americans, that we share as Americans -- the right to healthcare, the right to medical care, to housing, to all of these different things -- are illusory if the right to life isn\u2019t defended with maximum determination.\n\nSeventeen million African Americans, it\u2019s shown, that probably have been aborted since Roe v. Wade. And I supported you in the presidential election, gave several speeches in Michigan telling folks to vote pro-life in the general election, and I\u2019m really happy that you\u2019re here to continue the bipartisan belief that there should be no taxpayer-funding of abortion, and also really to support your effort to show that the patient, the human person, should be at the center of our American healthcare system, not the government. The government has its place, but the patient should be the center. So I\u2019m happy to support you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That\u2019s so nice. Thank you, I appreciate it. Great job.\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nDR. SETHI: Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting me. My name is Dr. Manny, and I run a nonprofit called Healthy Tennessee, and across Tennessee I\u2019m a trauma surgeon. But what we do is --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll be in Tennessee on Wednesday.\n\nDR. MANNY: We look forward to hosting you, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll see you there.\n\nDR. MANNY: Yes, sir. We do these large community events in rural Appalachia, across Tennessee, where we host these health fairs taking care of patients. So it\u2019s really a grassroots effort -- something that you understand better than anybody -- where people come out just to help people. Doctors, nurses on the ground, helping folks with preventative medicine, educating folks. That\u2019s what we do.\n\nBut the one thing I\u2019ve been seeing across Tennessee is that folks really can\u2019t afford these rising premiums. So what they\u2019re doing is, effectively, they\u2019re paying the tax penalty because it\u2019s cheaper and it works out better than paying for the insurance. And so that\u2019s been a big problem that we\u2019re seeing across the state. So thank you so much for what you\u2019re doing to tackle this problem.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So you\u2019ve seen a big problem, and the way out of the problem is to do a plan much more like the plan we\u2019re going to get done.\n\nDR. MANNY: Yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll get that out -- without penalties too, by the way. People don\u2019t mention all of the facts.\n\nYou know, the other thing about what we\u2019re talking about -- we really have a three-phase plan. They only want to talk about the first phase. The first phase is just the most basic of phases, and then you have phase two, which is largely done by our Secretary, and then you have phase three, which is a lot of the bells and whistles. But they don\u2019t want to talk about the bells and whistles. So they\u2019re really comparing things to something that won\u2019t be there for long.\n\nAnd the reason we have to do it that way is because of Congress. I\u2019d love to do it all in one package, but if you did it that way, it can\u2019t get done. So we\u2019re going to get something done that\u2019s going to be terrific.\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you, doctor, very much.\n\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\n\nMR. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. President. I\u2019d like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I, too, am from Tennessee, and I, too, am in the farming industry.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good.\n\nMR. BROWN: And the effect that I\u2019ve had through Obamacare is my wife's and my daughter's insurance is supplied through her work, I buy my own. And I\u2019ve seen the increases, since Obamacare, to the tune of about $5,000 a year, just for me. And I have considered taking the option of the penalty because -- my problem with the penalty is, though, if I opt out of the program, and buy a private plan -- just a catastrophic plan because I\u2019m a very healthy man -- if I take that option, not only is my income penalized, but my wife\u2019s income as well, because she makes a considerable more amount of money than I do, but she has insurance. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think -- the rate increase is just astronomical, and I\u2019m in the county that only has one option -- BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee --and I\u2019ve got about $540-a-month premium for the $7,000 out-of-pocket deductible before I see any help at all. And I even got to pay a high premium for a plan that I don\u2019t need or don\u2019t want --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Will you be able to continue, in the years to come, if you have to keep going like this?\n\nMR. BROWN: They\u2019re dropping out every day -- the suppliers in other counties. There\u2019s 35 counties in Tennessee that has no options at all right now. I don\u2019t know what those folks do.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know what that means? That means somebody is going to make a lot of money. You know that. They\u2019re going to make a lot of money. (Laughter.) Somebody is going to -- well, a few. You\u2019re not going to make it. They\u2019re going to make it. There are people very happy about this situation.\n\nMR. BROWN: Thank you for the opportunity to be here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate. Thank you, Joel.\n\nDoctor?\n\nDR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. Well, I\u2019m a physician in Texas, and thank you for allowing me to be here today. And I\u2019ll tell you, what I\u2019ve seen is that a lot of patients really are not adequately covered by Obamacare. It was supposed to cover people who had -- like everyone has said here -- with the rising premiums and the rising deductibles. I take care of patients in the hospital, and the patients are shocked to get a $20,000 bill, and to find that they\u2019re responsible for $6,000 of that because their deductible is so high. And that\u2019s just the situation that cannot continue.\n\nMedicaid expansion under Obamacare really doesn\u2019t cover folks either, because many physicians are not even taking Medicare. They\u2019re not accepting it any longer in the outpatient setting. And so folks who have chronic medical illnesses, like cancer -- I mean, my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and most of her treatment was actually as an outpatient. It was very expensive outpatient care. Most physicians don\u2019t even accept Medicaid, so those patients are still uncovered.\n\nAnd so the Medicaid expansion really hasn\u2019t covered them. The folks who have Obamacare insurance really are inadequately covered as well because they\u2019re still paying extremely high premiums and then having to pay extremely high deductibles. And so it\u2019s really --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And do they even reach it with the high deductibles? They don\u2019t even reach it for the most part.\n\nDR. ARMSTRONG: You know, oftentimes they do not, unless they have some sort of serious medical problem, and they\u2019re in the hospital, and it\u2019s very expensive -- they don\u2019t even reach their deductible oftentimes. And so it\u2019s unfortunate. So I really appreciate it.\n\nI actually read the bill that\u2019s been produced that\u2019s coming out of the House now, and I really like a lot of the changes in it. I think that this is going to correct a lot of the issues that Obamacare has had. So I really appreciate what you all are doing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate it, doctor. Thank you. Say hello to your wife.\n\nDR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. I will. Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Very nice. Thank you.\n\nGina.\n\nMS. SELL: Hi, Mr. President, I\u2019m Gina. I\u2019m from Wisconsin. I\u2019m a nurse, I\u2019m a mom, and I am part of that huge group of middle-class families that were impacted by the ACA.\n\nBefore ACA, we had insurance that was eventually cancelled, and I had written a letter to our senator just asking him, what do I do? Do I quit my job completely so that we can obtain a subsidy -- a job that I love, as a nurse in a hospital that I love? Or do I uproot my family and try to find a job with benefits that doesn\u2019t even cover the medical --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So the healthcare is -- the Obamacare forced you to actually -- in a sense, forces you, economically and almost potentially, to get another job.\n\nMS. SELL: Right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Even though you like your job.\n\nMS. SELL: Right. So I did end up getting a full-time position at the hospital that I worked at. But that came with a price because I was working three days a week, and spending time with my small children, who are my number-one priority. And after the ACA, I was forced -- because we could not afford a premium of $1,200 per month and a deductible that didn\u2019t cover anything -- to find a job with benefits.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Meaning the deductible was so high that, essentially, unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to use it.\n\nThe deductible was so high that essentially unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to use it.\n\nMS. SELL: Correct, yes. And we're still in that boat. I mean, right now our deductible is $6,500. And so if I have a child who's extremely sick, it's going to cost me hundreds of dollars. Just last week, my daughter had a fever, and I sent her to school for three days straight because I had to work to afford our assurance, and I couldn\u2019t afford to bring her to the doctor. So it has been devastating for our family.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It's really not having insurance at all. A lot of Obamacare, you don\u2019t really have insurance because the deductibles are so high that you really don\u2019t have insurance, if you think about it.\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. Good luck.\n\nMS. SELL: Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, sir.\n\nMR. KNOX: Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting us. This is great. I have to start with something. As I was leaving the house, my 11-year-old ran up to me and said, \"Dad, I'd like to have you give this to Mr. President for me.\" (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What do you have there? I wished I looked that good. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. KNOX: \"Dear President Trump, it is a great honor to be able to write to the President of the USA. I think you are a great President and a great man. Also, don't worry, the picture of you on the front of this looks nothing like you.\" (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you. I wish I looked that good.\n\nMR. KNOX: So I had the privilege of meeting with Secretary Price and Vice President Pence in Cincinnati about a week and a half ago at a roundtable, and I'll share with you what I shared with them. I started with a quote from the great President, Ronald Reagan, who said, \"The most terrifying words in the English language are we're from the government and we're here to help.'\" (Laughter.) Kind of my feeling on healthcare.\n\nFrankly, I think that the system was broken before the last administration got their hands on it. I started my company 21 years ago, and I had a vision of wanting to provide 100 percent full family healthcare for as long as I had a company, because I really felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do. I was one of the last holdouts. But, sadly, after about 15 years, I really had a choice of either having a company or being able to provide my employees that level of healthcare. And that's sad. I tell my wife all the time -- you can have anything you want, we just can't everything we want. We have the best healthcare system in the world -- we do -- but it needs to be fixed -- whether it's small business owners, like myself -- I'm a manufacturer, I'm on several boards in the Midwest in manufacturing.\n\nWhat we'd like to see is not a government-operated market, but a free market. I sell (inaudible) equipment for a living. We have a trade show every year, and there's hundreds and hundreds of people selling competitive products. If we had a healthcare show in my town, there would be three or four people under that roof. And as a businessman yourself, you know what that does to driving down costs or the lack thereof. So we would like to see more of a free-market solution, going back to what made this country great -- entrepreneurialism instead of empowerments; work ethics instead of welfare. And that's what we'd like to ask you for. And I'd like to say thank you very much.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: As you know, that's what we're doing largely, but we also have to take care of people that can't afford to be in a position like you are. So we're going to do that. Largely, I think beyond everything, if you look at what's going to happen -- the competitive bidding -- every element of what we're doing is competitive bidding, but we have to take care of people who need the help. And there are a lot of people like that.\n\nMR. KNOX: There's always been a safety net in the United States, and there should be. And, unfortunately, when I see 50,000 -- or 50 million Americans taking assistance in -- you know, they're market food stamps. That's like -- for the people who really can't provide for themselves, you know, we're all charitable people who are Americans, we're the most generous nation on the face of the Earth. So I totally believe in safety nets for those who need them, not free handouts for (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to help a lot of people, but we are going to be very much free market people. They can afford -- and they'll be off the cost.\n\nGo ahead, Stan.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: I'm Mr. Stan Summers from Box Elder County, northern Utah. I think I'm probably the only other elected official here besides you guys. It's been an interesting ride to watch the healthcare system in the last 26 years. When my son was born, he was three and a half months premature, 26 years ago. And we had really good insurance. We basically didn\u2019t have to pay anything out of pocket besides what we were doing from where I worked. As time went on, you could kind of tell the healthcare system has been a little bit broke, and then all of a sudden the ACA -- and I'm not going to call it the other word -- I call it the last President's healthcare program. I don\u2019t want to say that name.\n\nSo anyway --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Other than that, you like him a lot, right? (Laughter.)\n\nMR. SUMMERS: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) It's gotten to the point where I own a couple of businesses too and do the things that I have to do. I actually ran for government so I could have insurance -- and won. But now I'm looking at these people, saying, how can I provide insurance for them without raising taxes and doing these things that are happening -- because everything has gone up. Utah didn\u2019t expand Medicaid -- we weren\u2019t a part of that -- and we can see why now, because of the things that are happening throughout the nation with states and companies and everybody else going bankrupt.\n\nSo it got to the point where I ended up -- not only with my businesses -- I have to drive a school bus to keep my wife at home with my kid that was ill. So now I own three businesses, I drive a school bus, and I'm an elected official, to be able to continue to do the things that I need to do with healthcare. The last three -- well, the last three years --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So it's gone through the roof.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: Oh, I got a $6,000 deductible -- HSA -- but I will meet that again in three months. So I'm at -- I think my wife said morning, at 4,800 or 4,900 bucks already this year in March to be able to meet my out-of-pocket. And so by the time April comes, I would have met that to be able to continue to do. And if there was one thing I probably could ask you about -- and my boy has got a rare disease, and I appreciate you talking about the rare [disease] community in your speeches -- is that if somebody has cancer or somebody has a rare disease or continues to have problems, why do we have to do a deductible every year?\n\nSo I\u2019m sitting there at Christmas going, okay, my deductible has been met for six or eight months, and I\u2019m going to turn around and have to do it again for the same disease, for the same symptoms, for the same everything.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's interesting. Tom, could you answer that? That would be interesting.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: It\u2019s all about the risk and spreading the risk with insurance over a period of time. But it is a challenge for individuals with chronic disease, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: And I appreciate you even thinking about it and talking about grassroots, and when you're talking about all the people that we support with the farmers and ranchers, and the small-business people, and the people that are in manufacturing, our county is one of the largest manufacturing counties in the nation per capita. And Nucor would love to tell you thanks -- Nucor Steel would love to tell you thanks for everything you've been doing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nucor has been very good. It\u2019s going to get better, too.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: And we've got a ton of those. The space program -- we used to make the shuttle boosters out of ATK Thiokal. And we\u2019d love to have the space program. I got a really good friend.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Those days are gone, but they're coming back.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: I\u2019ve got a friend that's going to go up in the next little bit, Lieutenant Commander Scott Maker Tingle, who is headed up on a spaceship from Russia. But he would love to come back to the United States and be able to go up through the United States. So all those jobs I know will come back with you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Gary Cohn, who is sitting right next to you, he\u2019s a big believer in what you're saying -- right, Gary?\n\nMR. SUMMERS: If there\u2019s anything we can do to help you, the counties are behind you. We can find you low-hanging fruit to be able to pick off that tree to help with jobs. Just let us know where we can help.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you, Stan.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: Thank you for your time.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Would you have anything to say, Tom, generally speaking?\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, let me start, Mr. President -- really powerful about the consequences of the current law, and you hear people\u2019s lives that have been affected in remarkably adverse ways that sometimes you don't think about as it relates to healthcare -- whether it\u2019s businesses that haven\u2019t been able to survive, or individuals who need to take three, four, five jobs; moms that can't be with their kids when they want. This is about real people. It\u2019s about real patients.\n\nAnd so working with you and your leadership, we are really excited about the opportunity to put in place a patient-centered system where patients and families and doctors are making decisions, and not Washington, D.C.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What about the concept that -- and everybody knows it\u2019s happening -- that Obamacare is imploding, that if we don't do anything, it\u2019s not even going to be around in another year? The insurance companies are fleeing. But now it seems to be getting this wonderful press like it\u2019s a wonderful thing, and it\u2019s a horrible thing actually, and getting worse. And \u201917 will be, by far, the worst year so far.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because a lot of things were put into \u201917. But \u201917 is going to be worse, and I assume \u201918 will be worse even than \u201917. So it\u2019s essentially gone. How do you respond to that? Because I\u2019ve been telling you, \"Why don't we wait? Just let it implode, and let\u2019s not take the blame.\" I\u2019ve been telling you that as an option. It\u2019s not an option I like, frankly, but it\u2019s certainly an option. How do you respond to that?\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: I think \u201918 can be better if we implement the law and we utilize the regulatory process to make some --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m saying, if we don't implement the law, what happens with Obamacare? What\u2019s going on with Obamacare?\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: What you\u2019ll see is a magnification of all these stories around this table: more businesses being harmed, more individuals not having the kind of income that they -- disposable income that they would use, more moms and dads not able to care for their kids in the way that they believe to be most appropriate, more people getting insurance but no care. This is about real people\u2019s lives, and that's why it\u2019s so important.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Getting insurance but not being able to use it because the deductibles are so high.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: That's exactly right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you hear these stories where they're paying a fortune for insurance, and then you hear how high their deductible is. And unless they have a tragedy in their family, they're never going to be able to use it.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this fellow has to -- $13,000 before the insurance kicks in. That's what he has to pay -- $13,000.\n\nMR. SEIFE: That's like not having insurance.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: That's like not having insurance.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, keep working it.\n\nMS. SERTICH: They're catastrophic plans now.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Exactly.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s been working very hard, and he\u2019s doing a great job.\n\nMr. Vice President, do you have anything to say?\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr. President, I think what unequivocally these great Americans see in high relief is you're someone who puts people over politics. And I just want to thank all of them for coming, and in front of the national media, talking about the real world and impacts of Obamacare. You've said it consistently over the last two years that Obamacare has failed. But these people are emblematic of the Americans that Obamacare has failed. And I just am so grateful for their time, but so grateful for your compassionate leadership in driving the Congress and driving our nation toward better healthcare outcomes for them and better solutions built on those American principles of more consumer choices, more free market, but also, as you said, the caring for the most vulnerable by allowing our states to innovate and medicate in ways that will create even better healthcare coverage than they have today.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.\n\nQ Mr. President, do you have any message for those who are concerned about losing their insurance, whether it be Medicaid or higher costs (inaudible)?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It will get better. If we're allowed to do what we want to do, it will get better -- much better. Hopefully it will get very good.\n\nQ So will it take long?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It takes a period of time. Thank you, press.\n\nEND\n\n12:00 P.M. EDT",

Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.\n\nSo even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined.

For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.\n\nThat said, we think Clinton\u2019s definition of \"young\" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.\n\nOur ruling\n\nClinton said, \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\"\n\nAs long as you define \"young\" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton\u2019s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

    "text":"What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies \u2013 because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.\n\nThat's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan \u2013 more security and stability.\n\nNow, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange \u2013 a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.\n\nFor those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it.\n\nNow, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those \u2013 particularly the young and healthy \u2013 who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek \u2013 especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions \u2013 just can't be achieved.",

    "text":"Officials from the two prior administrations, of governors Paul Cellucci and Jane Swift, could not be reached last night, leaving it unclear whether their aides took similar actions regarding hard drives, e-mails, and computer servers.\n\n\u201cThey have an obligation as a public official to preserve their records,\u2019\u2019 Galvin said. \u201cElectronic records are held to the same standard as paper records. There\u2019s no question. They\u2019re not in some lesser standard.\u2019\u2019\n\nGalvin pointed out that, in 1997, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that \u201cthe governor is not explicitly included\u2019\u2019 in the Public Records Law. He said that means that e-mails don\u2019t have to be released to the public, but the governor\u2019s office still has to preserve them and turn them over to the state archivist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sell things to people who work for me,\u2019\u2019 said Galvin, a Democrat. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people getting their chair or something as a gift. But generally if you work for me you don\u2019t take your laptop with you when you leave.\u2019\u2019\n\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin, who oversees the state Public Records Law, said it appeared odd that state property - in this case, hard drives - was essentially being sold to private individuals.\n\nShe accused Patrick of \u201cdoing the Obama campaign\u2019s dirty work\u2019\u2019 and called it one in a series of \u201cpolitical attacks to distract from Obama\u2019s horrible record on jobs.\u2019\u2019 Patrick, a Democrat, is a close friend and supporter of President Obama, and is expected to play a prominent role in his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cIn leaving office, the governor\u2019s staff complied with the law and longtime executive branch practice,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSome employees exercised the option to purchase computer equipment when they left. They did so openly with personal checks.\u2019\u2019\n\nAndrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said the governor\u2019s aides did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s office has found no e-mails from 2002-2006 in our possession,\u2019\u2019 Reilly said in a statement. \u201cBefore the current administration took office, the computers used during that time period were replaced and the server used during that time period was taken out of service, all files were removed from it, and it was also replaced.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs a result, Patrick\u2019s office, which has been bombarded with inquiries for records from the Romney era, has no electronic record of any Romney administration e-mails, Reilly said.\n\nRomney administration officials had the remaining computers in the governor\u2019s office replaced just before Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s staff showed up to take power in January 2007, according to Mark Reilly, Patrick\u2019s chief legal counsel.\n\nJust before Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor\u2019s office and first ran for president, 11 of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administration\u2019s e-mails were all wiped from a server, according to interviews and records obtained by the Globe.\n\nJust before leaving office, Romney\u2019s staff went before the Records Conservation Board, which is made up of appointees from various state agencies and reviews public record retention. In some cases, the Romney administration was given permission to destroy records, Galvin said, oftentimes because they were redundant.\n\n\u201cI know that all of the Romney materials were dealt with by the public records board,\u2019\u2019 Galvin said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that what was portrayed to the records board was a complete and accurate summary. I don\u2019t know that.\u2019\u2019\n\nMark Nielsen, who was Romney\u2019s chief legal counsel, bought his hard drive on Dec. 12, 2006, just over two weeks before Patrick administration officials took over the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe longstanding practice in the governor\u2019s office was to give employees the option to buy old equipment when they were leaving office, and certain employees, including me, did that,\u2019\u2019 Nielsen told the Globe. \u201cBut those purchases were in conformance with the law and with longstanding executive branch practice.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that we complied with the letter and the spirit of the law,\u2019\u2019 he added. When asked why he would want to purchase his hard drive, he said, \u201cEmployees were given that option and it was my understanding that it was a longstanding practice in the governor\u2019s office.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen asked about replacing the remaining computers and wiping the server clean, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is we fully complied with the law and complied with longstanding executive branch practice. Nothing unusual was done.\u2019\u2019\n\nPam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, said Romney administration officials may not have violated the letter of the state Public Records Law, but may have run afoul of its spirit.\n\n\u201cInformation that was generated in the administration belongs to the people of the Commonwealth, unless it was personal in nature,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThere is a place for purchasing of surplus property, but there are procedures to do that. And it seems that we are, as a Commonwealth, losing something if all records were deleted.\u2019\u2019\n\nAll told, 11 Romney administration officials bought 17 hard drives from the governor\u2019s office, paying $65 for each one, according to copies of canceled checks that they wrote and members of the current administration. Many of the aides wrote \u201cequipment\u2019\u2019 or \u201chard drives\u2019\u2019 in the memo space on their checks.\n\nBeth E. Myers, who was Romney\u2019s chief of staff, bought her hard drive on Aug. 18, 2006, the same month that she left state employment.\n\nShe later became Romney\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nPeter G. Flaherty, who was Romney\u2019s deputy chief of staff, bought the hard drive from his computer on Nov. 3, 2006, four days before Patrick was elected, defeating his Republican opponent, Kerry Healey, who was Romney\u2019s lieutenant governor. Flaherty later became the Romney campaign\u2019s chief liaison to social conservatives.\n\nThe rest of the hard drives were bought in November and December of 2006 by other aides.\n\nWhile Patrick aides said they do not have any electronic records of Romney administration e-mails, Galvin said there are 700 to 800 boxes of paper records from the Romney era at the state archives in Boston.\n\nIn 2009, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston was embroiled in controversy after one of his top aides, Michael J. Kineavy, acknowledged that he had deleted nearly every e-mail he sent or received over the previous five years.\n\nThe law requires municipal employees to preserve e-mails for at least two years, even if they have \u201cno informational or evidential value,\u2019\u2019 and provides for penalties of up to a year in jail.\n\nA nine-month investigation by Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office concluded, however, that the destruction of the e-mails was not a crime because Kineavy was not willfully attempting to hide the correspondence from the public.\n\nLevenson can be reached at mlevenson@globe.com.

    "text":"Prepared Remarks Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States November 19, 2015 Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail Link\n\nIn his inaugural remarks in January 1937, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation and this is what he saw.\n\nHe saw tens of millions of its citizens denied the basic necessities of life.\n\nHe saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them day by day.\n\nHe saw millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.\n\nHe saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed and by their poverty and lack of disposable income denying employment to many other millions.\n\nHe saw one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.\n\nAnd he acted. Against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called economic royalists, Roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of people back to work, took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government. He redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our country. He combatted cynicism, fear and despair. He reinvigorated democracy. He transformed the country.\n\nAnd that is what we have to do today.\n\nAnd, by the way, almost everything he proposed was called \u201csocialist.\u201d Social Security, which transformed life for the elderly in this country was \u201csocialist.\u201d The concept of the \u201cminimum wage\u201d was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as \u201csocialist.\u201d Unemployment insurance, abolishing child labor, the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining, strong banking regulations, deposit insurance, and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as \u201csocialist.\u201d Yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class.\n\nThirty years later, in the 1960s, President Johnson passed Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children, persons with disabilities and some of the most vulnerable people in this county. Once again these vitally important programs were derided by the right wing as socialist programs that were a threat to our American way of life.\n\nThat was then. Now is now.\n\nToday, in 2015, despite the Wall Street crash of 2008, which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Depression, the American people are clearly better off economically than we were in 1937.\n\nBut, here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge and address. Despite a huge increase in technology and productivity, despite major growth in the U.S. and global economy, tens of millions of American families continue to lack the basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families. The reality is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low.\n\nThe rich get much richer. Almost everyone else gets poorer. Super PACs funded by billionaires buy elections. Ordinary people don\u2019t vote. We have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old, same old establishment politics and economics will not effectively address it.\n\nIf we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, we need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. The billionaire class cannot have it all. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.\n\nWe need to create a culture which, as Pope Francis reminds us, cannot just be based on the worship of money. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts, while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep out on the streets.\n\nToday, in America, we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but few Americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth goes to the people on top. In fact, over the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth \u2013 trillions of wealth \u2013 going from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent \u2013 a handful of people who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth they own over that period.\n\nUnbelievably, and grotesquely, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.\n\nToday, in America, millions of our people are working two or three jobs just to survive. In fact, Americans work longer hours than do the people of any industrialized country. Despite the incredibly hard work and long hours of the American middle class, 58 percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent.\n\nToday, in America, as the middle class continues to disappear, median family income, is $4,100 less than it was in 1999. The median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago, after adjusting for inflation. Last year, the median female worker earned more than $1,000 less than she did in 2007.\n\nToday, in America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings \u2013 zero \u2013 while millions of elderly and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year. From Vermont to California, older workers are scared to death. \u201cHow will I retire with dignity?,\u201d they ask?\n\nToday, in America, nearly 47 million Americans are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children, including 36 percent of African American children, are living in poverty \u2014 the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth.\n\nToday, in America, 29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles. Further, with the United States paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.\n\nToday, in America, youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35 percent. Meanwhile, we have more people in jail than any other country and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.\n\nThe bottom line is that today in America we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality. A handful of super-wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process, while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in Congress.\n\nIn 1944, in his State of the Union speech, President Roosevelt outlined what he called a second Bill of Rights. This is one of the most important speeches ever made by a president but, unfortunately, it has not gotten the attention that it deserves.\n\nIn that remarkable speech this is what Roosevelt stated, and I quote: \u201cWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men.\u201d End of quote. In other words, real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt\u2019s vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved. It is time that we did.\n\nIn that speech, Roosevelt described the economic rights that he believed every American was entitled to: The right to a decent job at decent pay, the right to adequate food, clothing, and time off from work, the right for every business, large and small, to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies. The right of all Americans to have a decent home and decent health care.\n\nWhat Roosevelt was stating in 1944, what Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in similar terms 20 years later and what I believe today, is that true freedom does not occur without economic security.\n\nPeople are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are unemployed or underpaid or when they are exhausted by working long hours. People are not truly free when they have no health care.\n\nSo let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me. It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated that; \u201cThis country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.\u201d It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that we must reform a political system in America today which is not only grossly unfair but, in many respects, corrupt.\n\nIt is a system, for example, which during the 1990s allowed Wall Street to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated. Then, ten years later, after the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior of Wall Street led to their collapse, it is a system which provided trillions in government aid to bail them out. Wall Street used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then, when their greed caused their collapse, they used their wealth and power to get Congress to bail them out. Quite a system!\n\nAnd, then, to add insult to injury, we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail, the bankers were too big to jail. Kids who get caught possessing marijuana get police records. Wall Street CEOs who help destroy the economy get raises in their salaries. This is what Martin Luther King, Jr. meant by socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else.\n\nIn my view, it\u2019s time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations. It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations, huge tax breaks for the very rich, or trade policies which boost corporate profits as workers lose their jobs. It means that we create a government that works for works for all of us, not just powerful special interests. It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what America stands for.\n\nIt means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. This is not a radical idea. It exists in every other major country on earth. Not just Denmark, Sweden or Finland. It exists in Canada, France, Germany and Taiwan. That is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all single payer health care system. Yes. The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write and voted for, is a step forward for this country. But we must build on it and go further.\n\nMedicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money, it would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy.\n\nPeople who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment. They could go to the doctor when they should, and not end up in the emergency room. Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees. Workers will not have to be trapped in jobs they do not like simply because their employers are offering them decent health insurance plans. Instead, they will be able to pursue the jobs and work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy. And by the way, moving to a Medicare for all program will end the disgrace of Americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that, in the year 2015, a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago \u2013 and that public education must allow every person in this country, who has the ability, the qualifications and the desire, the right to go to a public colleges or university tuition free. This is also not a radical idea. It exists today in many countries around the world. In fact, it used to exist in the United States.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy. It makes far more sense to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, than to have a real unemployment rate of almost 10%. It is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for unemployed young people, than to lock them up and spend $80 billion a year through mass incarceration.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty: that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage \u2013 $15 an hour over the next few years. It means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong Paid Family and Medical Leave legislation now in Congress. How can it possibly be that the United States, today, is virtually the only nation on earth, large or small, which does not guarantee that a working class woman can stay home for a reasonable period of time with her new-born baby? How absurd is that?\n\nDemocratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet, and that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren.\n\nDemocratic socialism means, that in a democratic, civilized society the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. Yes. Innovation, entrepreneurship and business success should be rewarded. But greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support. It is not acceptable that in a rigged economy in the last two years the wealthiest 15 Americans saw their wealth increase by $170 billion, more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans. Let us not forget what Pope Francis has so elegantly stated; \u201cWe have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.\u201d\n\nIt is not acceptable that major corporations stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion in taxes each and every year. It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. It is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax. It is not acceptable that Wall Street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on those transactions.\n\nDemocratic socialism, to me, does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice. It also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote. It is extremely sad that the United States, one of the oldest democracies on earth, has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country, and that millions of young and working class people have given up on our political system entirely. Every American should be embarrassed that in our last national election 63% of the American people, and 80% of young people, did not vote. Clearly, despite the efforts of many Republican governors to suppress the vote, we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process, not harder. It is not too much to demand that everyone 18 years of age is registered to vote \u2013 end of discussion.\n\nFurther, it is unacceptable that we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires, billionaires and large corporations to contribute as much as they want to Super Pacs to elect candidates who will represent their special interests. We must overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.\n\nSo the next time you hear me attacked as a socialist, remember this:\n\nI don\u2019t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal.\n\nI believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America instead of shipping jobs and profits overseas.\n\nI believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes \u2013 if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in special treatment for the top 1%, but I do believe in equal treatment for African-Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that Black Lives Matter.\n\nI despise appeals to nativism and prejudice, and I do believe in immigration reform that gives Hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in some foreign \u201cism\u201d, but I believe deeply in American idealism.\n\nI\u2019m not running for president because it\u2019s my turn, but because it\u2019s the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some, not for the few, but for all.\n\nNo one understood better than FDR the connection between American strength at home and our ability to defend America at home and across the world. That is why he proposed a second Bill of Rights in 1944, and said in that State of the Union:\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not running to pursue reckless adventures abroad, but to rebuild America\u2019s strength at home. I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses or into dubious battles with no end in sight.\n\nAnd when we discuss foreign policy, let me join the people of Paris in mourning their loss, and pray that those who have been wounded will enjoy a full recovery. Our hearts also go out to the families of the hundreds of Russians apparently killed by an ISIS bomb on their flight, and those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in Lebanon and elsewhere.\n\nTo my mind, it is clear that the United States must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and barbaric ISIS regime, and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing. But we cannot \u2013 and should not \u2013 do it alone.\n\nOur response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy. It begins with the acknowledgment that unilateral military action should be a last resort, not a first resort, and that ill-conceived military decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq, can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilize entire regions for decades. It begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past \u2013 rushing to war, regime change in Iraq, or toppling Mossadegh in Iran in 1953, or Guatemalan President \u00c1rbenz in 1954, Brazilian President Goulart in 1964, Chilean President Allende in 1973. These are the sorts of policies do not work, do not make us safer, and must not be repeated.\n\nAfter World War II, in response to the fear of Soviet aggression, European nations and the United States established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2013 an organization based on shared interests and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy. It is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror.\n\nWe must create an organization like NATO to confront the security threats of the 21st century \u2013 an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and importantly to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts. We must work with our NATO partners, and expand our coalition to include Russia and members of the Arab League.\n\nBut let\u2019s be very clear. While the U.S. and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations \u2013 with the strong support of their global partners.\n\nThese same sentiments have been echoed by those in the region. Jordan\u2019s King Abdallah II said in a speech on Sunday that terrorism is the \u201cgreatest threat to our region\u201d and that Muslims must lead the fight against it. He noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility, and that it is incumbent on Muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and generations with intolerance and violent ideology.\n\nAnd let me congratulate King Abdallah not only for his wise remarks, but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in the region.\n\nA new and strong coalition of Western powers, Muslim nations, and countries like Russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat ISIS, to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across, to share counter-terrorism intelligence, to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing, and to end support for exporting radical ideologies.\n\nWhat does all of this mean? Well, it means that, in many cases, we must ask more from those in the region. While Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little.\n\nEqually important, and this is a point that must be made \u2013 countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE \u2013 countries of enormous wealth and resources \u2013 have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS. That must change. King Abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS, and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region, who, up to this point have done far too little.\n\nSaudi Arabia has the 3rd largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by U.S. troops after the first Gulf War, has been a well-known source of financing for ISIS and other violent extremists. It has been reported that Qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event \u2013 $200 billion on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight against ISIS. Worse still, it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing, and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups, including al Nusra and ISIS.\n\nAll of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them. As we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against ISIS takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need.\n\nFurther, we all understand that Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator who has slaughtered many of his own people. I am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over world, known as the International Syria Support Group, set a timetable for a Syrian-led political transition with open and fair elections. These are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and to move to political transition.\n\nThe diplomatic plan for Assad\u2019s transition from power is a good step in a united front. But our priority must be to defeat ISIS. Nations all over the world, who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorist, must make the destruction of ISIS the highest priority. Nations in the region must commit \u2013 that instead of turning a blind eye \u2014 they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to Syria and Iraq. We need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism \u2013 rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders.\n\nThis is the model in which we must pursue solutions to the sorts of global threats we face.\n\nWhile individual nations indeed have historic disputes \u2013 the U.S. and Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia \u2013 the time is now to put aside those differences to work towards a common purpose of destroying ISIS. Sadly, as we have seen recently, no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization or those whom they have radicalized.\n\nThus, we must work with our partners in Europe, the Gulf states, Africa, and Southeast Asia \u2013 all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving our unified purpose.\n\nThe bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed, but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone. A new and effective coalition must be formed with the Muslim nations leading the effort on the ground, while the United States and other major forces provide the support they need.",

    "text":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148)\n\nOverall approach to expanding access to coverage Require most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance. Create state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges through which individuals can purchase coverage, with premium and cost-sharing credits available to individuals\/families with income between 133-400% of the federal poverty level (the poverty level is $19,530 for a family of three in 2013) and create separate Exchanges through which small businesses can purchase coverage. Require employers to pay penalties for employees who receive tax credits for health insurance through an Exchange, with exceptions for small employers. Impose new regulations on health plans in the Exchanges and in the individual and small group markets. Expand Medicaid to 133% of the federal poverty level.\n\nINDIVIDUAL MANDATE\n\nRequirement to have coverage Require U.S. citizens and legal residents to have qualifying health coverage. Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5% of household income. The penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1.0% of taxable income in 2014, 2.0% of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5% of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment. Exemptions will be granted for financial hardship, religious objections, American Indians, those without coverage for less than three months, undocumented immigrants, incarcerated individuals, those for whom the lowest cost plan option exceeds 8% of an individual\u2019s income, and those with incomes below the tax filing threshold (in 2009 the threshold for taxpayers under age 65 was $9,350 for singles and $18,700 for couples).\n\nEMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS\n\nRequirement to offer coverage Assess employers with 50 or more full-time employees that do not offer coverage and have at least one full-time employee who receives a premium tax credit a fee of $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30 employees from the assessment. Employers with 50 or more full-time employees that offer coverage but have at least one full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit, will pay the lesser of $3,000 for each employee receiving a premium credit or $2,000 for each full-time employee, excluding the first 30 employees from the assessment. (Effective January 1, 2014) \u2022 Exempt employers with up to 50 full-time employees from any of the above penalties.\n\nOther requirements Require employers with more than 200 employees to automatically enroll employees into health insurance plans offered by the employer. Employees may opt out of coverage.\n\nEXPANSION OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS\n\nTreatment of Medicaid Expand Medicaid to all non-Medicare eligible individuals under age 65 (children, pregnant women, parents, and adults without dependent children) with incomes up to 133% FPL based on modified adjusted gross income (as under current law undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid). All newly eligible adults will be guaranteed a benchmark benefit package that meets the essential health benefits available through the Exchanges. The Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA upheld the Medicaid expansion, but limited the ability of HHS to enforce it, thereby making the decision to expand Medicaid optional for states. To finance the coverage for the newly eligible (those who were not previously eligible for at least benchmark equivalent coverage, those who were eligible for a capped program but were not enrolled, or those who were enrolled in state-funded programs), states will receive 100% federal funding for 2014 through 2016, 95% federal financing in 2017, 94% federal financing in 2018, 93% federal financing in 2019, and 90% federal financing for 2020 and subsequent years. States that have already expanded eligibility to adults with incomes up to 100% FPL will receive a phased-in increase in the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for non-pregnant childless adults so that by 2019 they receive the same federal financing as other states (93% in 2019 and 90% in 2020 and later). States have the option to expand Medicaid eligibility to childless adults beginning on April 1, 2010, but will receive their regular FMAP until 2014. In addition, increase Medicaid payments in fee-for-service and managed care for primary care services provided by primary care doctors (family medicine, general internal medicine or pediatric medicine) to 100% of the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014. States will receive 100% federal financing for the increased payment rates. (Effective January 1, 2014)\n\nTreatment of CHIP Require states to maintain current income eligibility levels for children in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) until 2019 and extend funding for CHIP through 2015. CHIP benefit package and cost-sharing rules will continue as under current law. Provide states with the option to provide CHIP coverage to children of state employees who are eligible for health benefits if certain conditions are met. Beginning in 2015, states will receive a 23 percentage point increase in the CHIP match rate up to a cap of 100%. CHIP-eligible children who are unable to enroll in the program due to enrollment caps will be eligible for tax credits in the state Exchanges.\n\nPREMIUM AND COST-SHARING SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS\n\nEligibility Limit availability of premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies through the Exchanges to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who meet income limits. Employees who are offered coverage by an employer are not eligible for premium credits unless the employer plan does not have an actuarial value of at least 60% or if the employee share of the premium exceeds 9.5% of income. Legal immigrants who are barred from enrolling in Medicaid during their first five years in the U.S. will be eligible for premium credits.\n\nPremium credits Provide refundable and advanceable premium credits to eligible individuals and families with incomes between 100-400% FPL to purchase insurance through the Exchanges. The premium credits will be tied to the second lowest cost silver plan in the area and will be set on a sliding scale such that the premium contributions are limited to the following percentages of income for specified income levels: Up to 133% FPL: 2% of income 133-150% FPL: 3 \u2013 4% of income 150-200% FPL: 4 \u2013 6.3% of income 200-250% FPL: 6.3 \u2013 8.05% of income 250-300% FPL: 8.05 \u2013 9.5% of income 300-400% FPL: 9.5% of income Increase the premium contributions for those receiving subsidies annually to reflect the excess of the premium growth over the rate of income growth for 2014-2018. Beginning in 2019, further adjust the premium contributions to reflect the excess of premium growth over CPI if aggregate premiums and cost sharing subsidies exceed .504% of GDP.\n\nProvisions related to the premium and cost-sharing subsidies are effective January 1, 2014.\n\nCost-sharing subsidies Provide cost-sharing subsidies to eligible individuals and families. The cost-sharing credits reduce the cost-sharing amounts and annual cost-sharing limits and have the effect of increasing the actuarial value of the basic benefit plan to the following percentages of the full value of the plan for the specified income level:\n\n100-150% FPL: 94%\n\n150-200% FPL: 87%\n\n200-250% FPL: 73%\n\n250-400% FPL: 70%\n\nVerification Require verification of both income and citizenship status in determining eligibility for the federal premium credits.\n\nSubsidies and abortion coverage Ensure that federal premium or cost-sharing subsidies are not used to purchase coverage for abortion if coverage extends beyond saving the life of the woman or cases of rape or incest (Hyde amendment). If an individual who receives federal assistance purchases coverage in a plan that chooses to cover abortion services beyond those for which federal funds are permitted, those federal subsidy funds (for premiums or cost-sharing) must not be used for the purchase of the abortion coverage and must be segregated from private premium payments or state funds.\n\nPREMIUM SUBSIDIES TO EMPLOYERS\n\nSmall business tax credits Provide small employers with no more than 25 employees and average annual wages of less than $50,000 that purchase health insurance for employees with a tax credit. Phase I: For tax years 2010 through 2013, provide a tax credit of up to 35% of the employer\u2019s contribution toward the employee\u2019s health insurance premium if the employer contributes at least 50% of the total premium cost or 50% of a benchmark premium. The full credit will be available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000. The credit phases-out as firm size and average wage increases. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting these requirements are eligible for tax credits of up to 25% of the employer\u2019s contribution toward the employee\u2019s health insurance premium. Phase II: For tax years 2014 and later, for eligible small businesses that purchase coverage through the state Exchange, provide a tax credit of up to 50% of the employer\u2019s contribution toward the employee\u2019s health insurance premium if the employer contributes at least 50% of the total premium cost. The credit will be available for two years. The full credit will be available to employers with 10 or fewer employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000. The credit phases-out as firm size and average wage increases. Tax-exempt small businesses meeting these requirements are eligible for tax credits of up to 35% of the employer\u2019s contribution toward the employee\u2019s health insurance premium.\n\n\n\nReinsurance program Create a temporary reinsurance program for employers providing health insurance coverage to retirees over age 55 who are not eligible for Medicare. Program will reimburse employers or insurers for 80% of retiree claims between $15,000 and $90,000. Payments from the reinsurance program will be used to lower the costs for enrollees in the employer plan. Appropriate $5 billion to finance the program. (Effective 90 days following enactment through January 1, 2014)\n\nTAX CHANGES RELATED TO HEALTH INSURANCE OR FINANCING HEALTH REFORM\n\nTax changes related to health insurance Impose a tax on individuals without qualifying coverage of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount or 2.5% of household income to be phased-in beginning in 2014.\n\nExclude the costs for over-the-counter drugs not prescribed by a doctor from being reimbursed through an HRA or health FSA and from being reimbursed on a tax-free basis through an HSA or Archer Medical Savings Account. (Effective January 1, 2011)\n\nIncrease the tax on distributions from a health savings account or an Archer MSA that are not used for qualified medical expenses to 20% (from 10% for HSAs and from 15% for Archer MSAs) of the disbursed amount. (Effective January 1, 2011)\n\nLimit the amount of contributions to a flexible spending account for medical expenses to $2,500 per year increased annually by the cost of living adjustment. (Effective January 1, 2013)\n\nIncrease the threshold for the itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses from 7.5% of adjusted gross income to 10% of adjusted gross income for regular tax purposes; waive the increase for individuals age 65 and older for tax years 2013 through 2016. (Effective January 1, 2013)\n\nIncrease the Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) tax rate on wages by 0.9% (from 1.45% to 2.35%) on earnings over $200,000 for individual taxpayers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly and impose a 3.8% tax on unearned income for higher-income taxpayers (thresholds are not indexed). (Effective January 1, 2013)\n\nImpose an excise tax on insurers of employer-sponsored health plans with aggregate values that exceed $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage (these threshold values will be indexed to the consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U) for years beginning in 2020). The threshold amounts will be increased for retired individuals age 55 and older who are not eligible for Medicare and for employees engaged in high-risk professions by $1,650 for individual coverage and $3,450 for family coverage. The threshold amounts may be adjusted upwards if health care costs rise more than expected prior to implementation of the tax in 2018. The threshold amounts will be increased for firms that may have higher health care costs because of the age or gender of their workers. The tax is equal to 40% of the value of the plan that exceeds the threshold amounts and is imposed on the issuer of the health insurance policy, which in the case of a self-insured plan is the plan administrator or, in some cases, the employer. The aggregate value of the health insurance plan includes reimbursements under a flexible spending account for medical expenses (health FSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), employer contributions to a health savings account (HSA), and coverage for supplementary health insurance coverage, excluding dental and vision coverage. (Effective January 1, 2018)\n\nEliminate the tax deduction for employers who receive Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy payments. (Effective January 1, 2013)\n\nTax changes related to financing health reform Impose new annual fees on the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, according to the following schedule: $2.8 billion in 2012-2013;$3.0 billion in 2014-2016; $4.0 billion in 2017; $4.1 billion in 2018; and 2.8 billion in 2019 and later.\n\nImpose an annual fee on the health insurance sector, according to the following schedule: $8 billion in 2014; $11.3 billion in 2015-2016; $13.9 billion in 2017; $14.3 billion in 2018 For subsequent years, the fee shall be the amount from the previous year increased by the rate of premium growth.\n\nFor non-profit insurers, only 50% of net premiums are taken into account in calculating the fee. Exemptions granted for non-profit plans that receive more than 80% of their income from government programs targeting low-income or elderly populations, or people with disabilities, and voluntary employees\u2019 beneficiary associations (VEBAs) not established by an employer. (Effective January 1, 2014) Impose an excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of any taxable medical device. (Effective for sales after December 31, 2012)\n\nLimit the deductibility of executive and employee compensation to $500,000 per applicable individual for health insurance providers. (Effective January 1, 2009)\n\nImpose a tax of 10% on the amount paid for indoor tanning services. (Effective July 1, 2010)\n\nExclude unprocessed fuels from the definition of cellulosic biofuel for purposes of applying the cellulosic biofuel producer credit. (Effective January 1, 2010)\n\nClarify application of the economic substance doctrine and increase penalties for underpayments attributable to a transaction lacking economic substance. (Effective upon enactment)\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES\n\nCreation and structure of health insurance exchanges Create state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Exchanges, administered by a governmental agency or non-profit organization, through which individuals and small businesses with up to 100 employees can purchase qualified coverage. Permit states to allow businesses with more than 100 employees to purchase coverage in the SHOP Exchange beginning in 2017. States may form regional Exchanges or allow more than one Exchange to operate in a state as long as each Exchange serves a distinct geographic area. (Funding available to states to establish Exchanges within one year of enactment and until January 1, 2015)\n\nEligibility to purchase in the exchanges Restrict access to coverage through the Exchanges to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who are not incarcerated.\n\nMulti-state plans Require the Office of Personnel Management to contract with insurers to offer at least two multi-state plans in each Exchange. At least one plan must be offered by a non-profit entity and at least one plan must not provide coverage for abortions beyond those permitted by federal law. Each multi-state plan must be licensed in each state and must meet the qualifications of a qualified health plan. If a state has lower age rating requirements than 3:1, the state may require multi-state plans to meet the more protective age rating rules. These multi-state plans will be offered separately from the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and will have a separate risk pool.\n\nConsumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) Create the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to foster the creation of non-profit, member-run health insurance companies in all 50 states and District of Columbia to offer qualified health plans.

A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.\"\n\nWith images such as a newspaper headline that says \"McCain climate views clash with GOP,\" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.\n\nIndeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.\n\nWhen he introduced the bill, McCain called it \"the first comprehensive piece of legislation\" in capping emissions.\n\n\"The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \"It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.\"\n\nBy contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.\n\nManik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9\/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in \"educating the Senate\" about how government could respond to global warming.\n\n\"It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,\" Roy said.\n\nHe called McCain \"a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.\"\n\nAnd so we find McCain's statement to be True.",

    "text":"It's not often you see someone stand up and say, \"Tax me more!\"\n\nYet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, \"Stop Coddling the Super-Rich.\" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.\n\n\"While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,\" he writes.\n\nAs an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.\n\n\n\n\"If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine \u2014 most likely by a lot,\" Buffett wrote. \"To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\n\n\nBuffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\nBefore we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.\n\n\n\nIncome taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:\n\n\u2022 the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.\n\nKeep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.\n\nPayroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.\n\nHead hurt yet? Ours, too.\n\nTaxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.\n\nSome hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as \"carried interest\" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.\n\nGetting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,\" while middle class taxpayers \"fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\nHe's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nBuffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.\n\nOne final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.\n\nSo when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.",

REUTERS\/Goran Tomasevic\n\n\u201cThis proposal is coming before the secretary this week,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. \u201cHe will take it and consider it thoroughly before approving it.\u201d\n\nViolence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.\n\nFor months, Gates has pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But if the Pentagon chief backs the proposal, it will show Washington has concluded it will have to provide a large share of any extra combat forces.\n\nGates ordered a boost in U.S. forces early last year in response to the violence and the United States currently has some 27,000 troops in Afghanistan -- a record high.\n\nAround half the U.S. troops serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led security assistance force while the rest conduct missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan troops.\n\nWhile NATO says it thwarted last year\u2019s attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence is up 27 percent over a year ago and it has risen by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said last month.\n\nIN PLACE BY APRIL\n\nMorrell said most of the Marines would go to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian and Dutch troops have done much of the fighting.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to get this in place to prevent, as we did last spring, another attempt by the Taliban to come back,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe timing is that they would be in place by April. This is a one-time seven-month deployment.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting allies in Scotland last month, Gates signaled a shift away from pressing NATO nations to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops.\n\nHe suggested the allies could help with other areas of the mission of rebuilding Afghanistan. But that shift means the United States must shoulder more of the combat burden.\n\n\u201cThe commander needs additional forces there. Our allies are not in a position to provide them so we are now looking at perhaps carrying a bit of that additional load,\u201d Morrell said.\n\nU.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nMorrell said the plan to send the Marines would be contained in a schedule of deployment proposals presented to Gates on Friday.\n\nThe plan would involve the deployment of a unit called a Marine Air Ground Task Force to fight in southern Afghanistan, and a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff developed the plan after a request from Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, and it has the support of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a U.S. military official said.",

    "text":"6 hours ago\n\n(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan met in Danville, Kentucky on Thursday evening for the vice presidential debate.\n\n\n\nMARTHA RADDATZ, MODERATOR: Good evening, and welcome to the first and only vice presidential debate of 2012, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives to public service.\n\nTonight's debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues. And I'm going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic, since that is what a vice president or president would have to do. We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions.\n\nBy coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question. We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate - and right now, as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. OK, you got your little wave to the families in.\n\nIt's great. Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.\n\nI would like to begin with Libya. On a rather somber note, one month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9\/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear, there were no protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: What is was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It - Chris\n\nStevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans.\n\nI can make absolutely two commitments to you and all the American people tonight. One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this. And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever - wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.\n\nWhen you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That's caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day. On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 - he ended it. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.\n\nWith regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one. And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, \"My highest priority is to get bin Laden.\"\n\nPrior to the election, prior to the - him being sworn in, said, \"I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.\" He didn't understand it was more than about taking a murderer off the battlefield. It was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know, if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell if need be. And lastly, the president of the United States has - has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.\n\nHe went to the U.N. and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times - he talked about the YouTube video.\n\nlook, if we're hit by terrorists we're going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an Al Qaida cell with arms?\n\nThis is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.\n\nWith respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration. Let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement. We don't have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get one. That's what we are talking about.\n\nNow, when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get.\n\nNow, with respect to Afghanistan, the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want it do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad, and that's what's happening here.\n\nRYAN: This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself, but unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem. And that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the (inaudible) more chaotic us less safe.\n\nRADDATZ: I just want to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and you're talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness; talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?\n\nRYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let's recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will - it's never too early to speak out for our values.\n\nWe should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights.\n\nAnd we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we're cutting down on defense, it makes us more weak. It projects weakness. And when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks, and are allies are less willing to...\n\n[CROSSTALK]\n\nBIDEN: With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: And why is that so?\n\nBIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all...\n\nRADDATZ: Be specific.\n\nBIDEN: I will be very specific. Number one, the - this lecture on embassy security - the congressman here cut embassy security in much for the embassy security piece.\n\nNumber two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this - this weakness. I - I don't understand what my friend's talking about here.\n\nWe - this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is a guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again. This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China, to bring about the most devastating - most devastating - the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop (inaudible).\n\nLook, I - I just - I mean, these guys bet against America all\n\nthe time.\n\nRADDATZ: Can we talk - let me go back to Libya.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah, sure.\n\nRADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why - why\n\nwere people talking about protests? When people in the consulate\n\nfirst saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters.\n\nWhy did that go on (inaudible)?\n\nBIDEN: Because that was exactly what we were told by the\n\nintelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As\n\nthey learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed\n\ntheir assessment. That's why there's also an investigation headed by\n\nTom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing\n\nan investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the\n\nlapses were, so that they will never happen again.\n\nRADDATZ: And they wanted more security there.\n\nBIDEN: Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there.\n\nWe did not know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at\n\nthe time we were told exactly - we said exactly what the intelligence\n\ncommunity told us that they knew. That was the assessment. And as\n\nthe intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they\n\nchanged their view.\n\nThat's why I said we will get to the bottom of this. You know,\n\nusually when there's a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as\n\na nation. But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the\n\nambassador, the governor was holding a press conference - was holding\n\na press conference. That's not presidential leadership.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about - the Romney\n\ncampaign talks a lot about no apologies. He has a book called called\n\n\"No Apologies.\" Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning\n\nKorans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines\n\nurinating on Taliban corpses?\n\nRYAN: Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we\n\nshould not apologize for...\n\nRADDATZ: Burning Korans, immediately?\n\nRYAN: What - what we should not be apologizing for are standing\n\nup for our values. What we should not be doing is saying to the\n\nEgyptian people, while Mubarak is cracking down on them, that he's a\n\ngood guy and, in the next week, say he ought to go.\n\nWhat we should not be doing is rejecting claims for - for calls\n\nfor more security in our barracks, in our Marine - we need Marines in\n\nBenghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for\n\nsecurity. There were requests for extra security; those requests were\n\nnot honored.\n\nLook, this was the anniversary of 9\/11. It was Libya, a country\n\nwe knew we had Al Qaida cells there, as we know Al Qaida and its\n\naffiliates are on the rise in Northern Africa. And we did not give\n\nour ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment?\n\nOf course there's an investigation, so we can make sure that this\n\nnever happens again, but when it comes to speaking up for our values,\n\nwe should not apologize for those. Here's the problem. Look at all\n\nthe various issues out there, and it's unraveling before our eyes.\n\nThe vice president talks about sanctions on Iran. They got - we've\n\nhad four...\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move to Iran. I'd actually like to move to Iran,\n\nbecause there's really no bigger national security...\n\nRYAN: Absolutely.\n\nRADDATZ: ... this country is facing. Both President Obama and\n\nGovernor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a\n\nnuclear weapon, even if that means military action. Last week, former\n\nDefense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Iran's facilities would\n\nnot work and, quote, \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for\n\ngenerations.\" Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to\n\nthe American people how effective would a military strike be?\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.\n\nNow, let's take a look at where we've gone - come from. When Barack\n\nObama was elected, they had enough fissile material - nuclear\n\nmaterial to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They're\n\nracing toward a nuclear weapon. They're four years closer toward a\n\nnuclear weapons capability.\n\nWe've had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from\n\nthe Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is\n\nbecause Russia watered it down and prevented the - the sanctions from\n\nhitting the central bank.\n\nMitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I've\n\nbeen fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was\n\nblocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong\n\nbipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule\n\ntheir objections and put them in spite of the administration.\n\nImagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in\n\nplace earlier. You think Iran's not brazen? Look at what they're\n\ndoing. They're stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a\n\nterrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to\n\nblow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd talk about credibility? When this administration says that\n\nall options are on the table, they send out senior administration\n\nofficials that send all these mixed signals.\n\nAnd so, in order to solve this peacefully - which is everybody's\n\ngoal - you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at\n\nwhere they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It's\n\nbecause this administration has no credibility on this issue. It's\n\nbecause this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions,\n\ntried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place.\n\nNow we have them in place because of Congress. They say the\n\nmilitary option's on the table, but it's not being viewed as credible.\n\nAnd the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have\n\ncredibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility\n\non this issue.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: It's incredible. Look, imagine had we let the Republican\n\nCongress work out the sanctions. You think there's any possibility\n\nthe entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our\n\nallies? These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of\n\nsanctions, period. Period.\n\nthese sanctions.\" When he said, \"Well, you're talking about doing\n\nmore,\" what are you - you're going to go to war? Is that what you\n\nwant to do?\n\nRYAN: We want to prevent war.\n\nBIDEN: And the interesting thing is, how are they going to\n\nprevent war? How are they going to prevent war if they say there's\n\nnothing more that we - that they say we should do than what we've\n\nalready done, number one.\n\nAnd number two, with regard to the ability of the United States\n\nto take action militarily, it is - it is not in my purview to talk\n\nabout classified information. But we feel quite confident we could\n\ndeal a serious blow to the Iranians.\n\nBut number two, the Iranians are - the Israelis and the United\n\nStates, our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the\n\nsame exact place in terms of how close - how close the Iranians are\n\nto getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no\n\ndifference between our view and theirs.\n\nWhen my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take\n\nthis highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up, then they\n\nhave to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon\n\nthat the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know\n\n\u2013 we'll know if they start the process of building a weapon.\n\nSo all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk, what are\n\nthey talking about? Are you talking about, to be more credible \u2013\n\nwhat more can the president do, stand before the United Nations, tell\n\nthe whole world, directly communicate to the ayatollah, we will not\n\nlet them acquire a nuclear weapon, period, unless he's talking about\n\ngoing to war.\n\nRYAN: Martha? Let's...\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What\n\ndo they see? They see this administration trying to water down\n\nsanctions in Congress for over two years. They're moving faster\n\ntoward a nuclear weapon. They're spinning the centrifuges faster.\n\nThey see us saying when we come into the administration, when\n\nthey're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see\n\nPresident Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and\n\nhe, instead of meeting with him, goes on a - on a daily talk show.\n\nThey see, when we say that these options are on the table, the\n\nsecretary of defense walked them back.\n\nThey are not changing their mind. That's what we have to do, is\n\nchange their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they're\n\ngoing faster.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you do it so quickly? Look, you - you both saw\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb with a red line and\n\ntalking about the red line being in spring. So can you solve this, if\n\nthe Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, can you solve this in two months\n\nbefore spring and avoid nuclear - nuclear...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We can debate a time line. We can debate the time line,\n\nwhether there's - it's that short a time or longer. I agree that\n\nit's probably longer.\n\nNumber two, it's all about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You don't agree with that bomb and whether the\n\nIsraelis...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: I don't want to go into classified stuff. But we both\n\nagree that to do this peacefully you've got to get them to change\n\ntheir minds. They're not changing their minds. And look at what this\n\nadministration...\n\nRADDATZ: But what - what do...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees.\n\nRYAN: You have to have credibility.\n\nBIDEN: The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled. The\n\nayatollah sees that there are 50 percent fewer exports of oil. He\n\nsees the currency going into the tank. He sees the economy going into\n\nfreefall. And he sees the world for the first time totally united in\n\nopposition to him getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nNow, with regard to Bibi, who's been my friend 39 years, the\n\npresident has met with Bibi a dozen times. He's spoken to Bibi\n\nNetanyahu as much as he's spoken to anybody. The idea that we're not\n\n\u2013 I was in a, just before he went to the U.N., I was in a conference\n\ncall with the - with the president, with him talking to Bibi for well\n\nover an hour, in - in - in stark relief and detail of what was going\n\non.\n\nThis is a bunch of stuff. Look, here's the deal.\n\nRADDATZ: What does that mean, a bunch of stuff?\n\nBIDEN: Well, it means it's simply inaccurate.\n\nRYAN: It's Irish.\n\nBIDEN: It - it is.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe Irish call it malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks for the translation. OK.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: We Irish call it malarkey. But last thing. The\n\nsecretary of defense has made it absolutely clear, we didn't walk\n\nanything back. We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear\n\nweapon. What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point where\n\nthey can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon. They don't have\n\na weapon to put it into.\n\nLet's all calm down a little bit here. Iran is more isolated\n\ntoday than when we took office. It was on the ascendancy when we took\n\noffice. It is totally isolated.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nBIDEN: I don't know what world this guy's living in.\n\nRYAN: Thank heavens we had these sanctions in place. It's in\n\nspite of their opposition.\n\nBIDEN: Oh, god.\n\nRYAN: They've given 20 waivers to this sanction. And all I have\n\nto point to are the results. They're four years closer toward a\n\nnuclear weapon. I think that case speaks for itself.\n\nRADDATZ: Can you tell the American people...\n\nBIDEN: By the way, they...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: What's worse, another war in the Middle East...\n\nBIDEN: ... they are not four years closer to a nuclear weapon.\n\nRYAN: Of course they are.\n\nBIDEN: They're - they're closer to being able to get enough\n\nfissile material to put in a weapon if they had a weapon.\n\nRADDATZ: You are acting a little bit like they don't want one.\n\nBIDEN: Oh, I didn't say - no, I'm not saying that. But facts\n\nmatter, Martha. You're a foreign policy expert. Facts matter. All\n\nthis loose talk about them, \"All they have to do is get to enrich\n\nuranium in a certain amount and they have a weapon,\" not true. Not\n\ntrue.\n\nThey are more - and if we ever have to take action, unlike when\n\nwe took office, we will have the world behind us, and that matters.\n\nThat matters.\n\nRADDATZ: What about Bob Gates' statement? Let me read that\n\nagain, \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations.\"\n\nBIDEN: He is right. It could prove catastrophic, if we didn't\n\ndo it with precision.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: And what it does is it undermines our credibility by\n\nbacking up the point when we make it that all options are on the\n\ntable. That's the point. The ayatollahs see these kinds of\n\nstatements and they think, \"I'm going to get a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nWhen - when we see the kind of equivocation that took place\n\nbecause this administration wanted a precondition policy, so when the\n\nGreen Revolution started up, they were silent for nine days. When\n\nthey see us putting - when they see us putting daylight between\n\nourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement.\n\nWhen they see Russia watering down any further sanctions, the only\n\nreason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down and\n\nprevented these central bank sanctions in the first place. So when\n\nthey see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue, and\n\nthat's the problem.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, let me tell you what Russia...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Well, let me ask you what's worse, war in the Middle\n\nEast, another war in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?\n\nRYAN: I'll tell you what's worse. I'll tell you what's worse.\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly.\n\nRYAN: A nuclear-armed Iran which triggers a nuclear arms race in\n\nthe Middle East. This is the world's largest sponsor of - of\n\nterrorism. They've dedicated themselves...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... to wiping an entire country off the map. They call us\n\nthe Great Satan. And if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the\n\nneighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons, as well.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nRYAN: We can't live with that.\n\nBIDEN: War should always be the absolute last resort. That's\n\nwhy these crippling sanctions, which Bibi Netanyahu says we should\n\ncontinue, which - if I'm not mistaken - Governor Romney says we \u2013\n\nwe should continue. I may be mistaken. He changes his mind so often,\n\nI could be wrong.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, he says they're working. And the\n\nfact is that they are being crippled by them. And we've made it\n\nclear, big nations can't bluff. This president doesn't bluff.\n\nRADDATZ: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a\n\ndifferent kind of national security issue, the state of our economy.\n\nThe number-one issue here at home is jobs. The percentage of\n\nunemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months.\n\nThe Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6\n\npercent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in\n\nstimulus money.\n\nSo will both of you level with the American people: Can you get\n\nunemployment to under 6 percent and how long will it take?\n\nBIDEN: I don't know how long it will take. We can and we will\n\nget it under 6 percent. Let's look at - let's take a look at the\n\nfacts. Let's look at where we were when we came to office. The\n\neconomy was in free fall. We had - the great recession hit; 9\n\nmillion people lost their job; $1.7 - $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in\n\nequity in your homes, in retirement accounts for the middle class.\n\nWe knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went\n\nout and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we\n\ncut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that \u2013\n\nwhen that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, \"No, let Detroit\n\ngo bankrupt.\" We moved in and helped people refinance their homes.\n\nGovernor Romney said, \"No, let foreclosures hit the bottom.\"\n\nBut it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of\n\nthe American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own\n\nlives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said \"30 percent\n\nof the American people are takers.\"\n\nThese people are my mom and dad - the people I grew up with, my\n\nneighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in\n\nhis federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are\n\nliving off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting\n\nin Afghanistan right now who are, quote, \"not paying any tax.\"\n\nI've had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent - it's\n\nabout time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing\n\npledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to\n\ncontribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a\n\npledge saying to the middle class we're going to level the playing\n\nfield; we're going to give you a fair shot again; we are going to not\n\nrepeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of\n\nrules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to\n\nhemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy.\n\nBIDEN: They're pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will\n\ngive an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And\n\nthey're holding hostage the middle class tax cut because they say we\n\nwon't pass - we won't continue the middle class tax cut unless you\n\ngive the tax cut for the super wealthy.\n\nIt's about time they take some responsibility.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Joe and I are from similar towns. He's from Scranton,\n\nPennsylvania. I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin. You know what the\n\nunemployment rate in Scranton is today?\n\nBIDEN: I sure do.\n\nRYAN: It's 10 percent.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: You know what it was the day you guys came in - 8.5\n\npercent.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: That's how it's going all around America.\n\nLook...\n\nBIDEN: You don't read the statistics. That's not how it's\n\ngoing. It's going down.\n\nRADDATZ: (inaudible) two-minute answer (inaudible)\n\nRYAN: Look, did they come in and inherit a tough situation?\n\nAbsolutely. But we're going in the wrong direction. Look at where we\n\nare. The economy is barely limping along. It's growing a 1.3\n\npercent. That's slower than it grew last year and last year was\n\nslower than the year before.\n\nJob growth in September was slower than it was in August, and\n\nAugust was slower than it was in July. We're heading in the wrong\n\ndirection; 23 million Americans are struggling for work today; 15\n\npercent of Americans are living in poverty today. This is not what a\n\nreal recovery looks like.\n\nWe need real reforms for real recovery and that's exactly what\n\nMitt Romney and I are proposing. It's a five-point plan. Get America\n\nenergy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help\n\npeople who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they\n\nwant. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt\n\ncrisis.\n\nMake trade work for America so we can make more things in America\n\nand sell them overseas, and champion small businesses. Don't raise\n\ntaxes on small businesses because they're our job creators.\n\nRYAN: He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney's a car guy. They\n\nkeep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know.\n\nThis is a guy who I was talking to a family in Northborough,\n\nMassachusetts the other day, Sheryl and Mark Nixon. Their kids were\n\nhit in a car crash, four of them. Two of them, Rob and Reed, were\n\nparalyzed. The Romneys didn't know them. They went to the same\n\nchurch; they never met before.\n\nboys, his wife, and gifts. Later on, he said, \"I know you're\n\nstruggling, Mark. Don't worry about their college. I'll pay for it.\"\n\nWhen Mark told me this story, because, you know what, Mitt Romney\n\ndoesn't tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told\n\nme this story, he said it wasn't the help, the cash help. It's that\n\nhe gave his time, and he has consistently.\n\nThis is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more\n\nthan the two of us combined. Mitt Romney's a good man. He cares\n\nabout 100 percent of Americans in this country. And with respect to\n\nthat quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes\n\nthe words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBIDEN: But I always say what I mean. And so does Romney.\n\nRYAN: We want everybody to succeed. We want to get people out\n\nof poverty, in the middle class, onto a life of self-sufficiently. We\n\nbelieve in opportunity and upward mobility. That's what we're going\n\nto push for in a Romney administration.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice president? I have a feeling you have a few things\n\nto say here.\n\nBIDEN: The idea - if you heard that - that little soliloquy on\n\n47 percent and you think he just made a mistake, then I think you're\n\n\u2013 I - I think - I got a bridge to sell you.\n\nLook, I don't doubt his personal generosity. And I understand\n\nwhat it's like. When I was a little younger than the congressman, my\n\nwife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife, and my two\n\nsons survived. I have sat in the homes of many people who've gone\n\nthrough what I get through, because the one thing you can give people\n\nsolace is to know if they know you've been through it, that they can\n\nmake it. So I don't doubt his personal commitment to individuals.\n\nBut you know what? I know he had no commitment to the automobile\n\nindustry. He just - he said, let it go bankrupt, period. Let it\n\ndrop out. All this talk - we saved a million jobs. Two hundred\n\nthousand people are working today.\n\nAnd I've never met two guys who're more down on America across\n\nthe board. We're told everything's going bad. There are 5.2 million\n\nnew jobs, private-sector jobs. We need more, but 5.2 million - if\n\nthey'd get out of the way, if they'd get out of the way and let us\n\npass the tax cut for the middle class, make it permanent, if they get\n\nout of the way and pass the - pass the jobs bill, if they get out of\n\nthe way and let us allow 14 million people who are struggling to stay\n\nin their homes because their mortgages are upside down, but they never\n\nmissed a mortgage payment, just get out of the way.\n\nStop talking about how you care about people. Show me something.\n\nShow me a policy. Show me a policy where you take responsibility.\n\nAnd, by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell\n\nout of the sky, like, \"Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?\" It\n\ncame from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, to at the\n\nsame time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a\n\ntrillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. I was there. I voted\n\nagainst them. I said, no, we can't afford that.\n\nAnd now, all of a sudden, these guys are so seized with the\n\nconcern about the debt that they created.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Let's not forget that they came in with one-party control.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything. They\n\nhad the ability to do everything of their choosing. And look at where\n\nwe are right now.\n\nThey passed the stimulus. The idea that we could borrow $831\n\nbillion, spend it on all of these special interest groups, and that it\n\nwould work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8\n\npercent - it went up above 8 percent for 43 months. They said that,\n\nright now, if we just passed this stimulus, the economy would grow at\n\n4 percent. It's growing at 1.3.\n\nRADDATZ: When could you get it below 6 percent?\n\nRYAN: That's what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan for\n\na stronger middle class is all about: getting the economy growing at\n\n4 percent, creating 12 million jobs over the next four years.\n\nLook at just the $90 billion in stimulus. The vice president was\n\nin charge of overseeing this. $90 billion in green pork to campaign\n\ncontributors and special interest groups. There are just at the\n\nDepartment of Energy over 100 criminal investigations that have been\n\nlaunched into just how stimulus...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Martha...\n\nRADDATZ: Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, look. His colleague...\n\nRYAN: Crony capitalism and corporate welfare.\n\nBIDEN: ... runs an investigative committee, spent months and\n\nmonths and months going into this.\n\nRYAN: This is the - this is the inspector general.\n\nBIDEN: Months and months. They found no evidence of cronyism.\n\nAnd I love my friend here. I - I'm not allowed to show letters\n\nbut go on our website, he sent me two letters saying, \"By the way, can\n\nyou send me some stimulus money for companies here in the state of\n\nWisconsin?\" We sent millions of dollars. You know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You did ask for stimulus money, correct?\n\nBIDEN: Sure he did. By the way...\n\nRYAN: On two occasions we - we - we advocated for constituents\n\nwho were applying for grants. That's what we do. We do that for all\n\nconstituents who are...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: I love that. I love that. This was such a bad program\n\nand he writes me a letter saying - writes the Department of Energy a\n\nletter saying, \"The reason we need this stimulus, it will create\n\ngrowth and jobs.\" His words. And now he's sitting here looking at\n\nme.\n\nAnd by the way, that program, again, investigated. What the\n\nCongress said was it was a model. Less than four-tenths of 1 percent\n\nwaste or fraud in the program.\n\nAnd all this talk about cronyism. They investigated and\n\ninvestigated, did not find one single piece of evidence. I wish he\n\nwould just tell - be a little more candid.\n\nRYAN: Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric\n\ncars in Finland, or on windmills in China?\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\nRYAN: Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries\n\nlike China and spend it on all these various different interest\n\ngroups?\n\nBIDEN: Let me tell you what was a good idea. It was a good\n\nidea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to\n\nstop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able\n\nto grow again. We have, in fact, 4 percent of those green jobs didn't\n\ngo under - went under, didn't work. It's a better batting average\n\nthan investment bankers have. They have about a 40 percent...\n\nRYAN: Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being...\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements. I\n\nthink we've gone over this quite enough.\n\nBIDEN: By the way, any letter you send me, I'll entertain.\n\nRYAN: I appreciate that, Joe.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: Let's talk about Medicare and entitlements. Both\n\nMedicare and Social Security are going broke and taking a larger share\n\nof the budget in the process.\n\nWill benefits for Americans under these programs have to change\n\nfor the programs to survive?\n\nMr. Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going\n\nbankrupt. These are indisputable facts.\n\nLook, when I look at these programs, we've all had tragedies in\n\nour lives. I think about what they've done for my own family. My mom\n\nand I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer's.\n\nMedicare was there for here, just like it's there for my mom right now\n\nwho is a Florida senior.\n\nAfter my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors\n\nbenefits, helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college\n\nin her 50s where she started a small business because of the new\n\nskills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these\n\nprograms would be there for her.\n\nWe will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform\n\nit for my generation.\n\nYou see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people\n\n54 and below, you can guarantee they don't change for people in or\n\nnear retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are\n\nproposing.\n\nLook what - look what Obamacare does. Obamacare takes $716\n\nbillion from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. Even their own chief\n\nactuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can't spend the same\n\ndollar twice. You can't claim that this money goes to Medicare and\n\nObamacare.\n\nRYAN: And then they put this new Obamacare board in charge of\n\ncutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied\n\ncare for current seniors.\n\nThis board, by the way, it's 15 people, the president's supposed\n\nto appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have\n\nmedical training.\n\nAnd Social Security? If we don't shore up Social Security, when\n\nwe run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent\n\nacross-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle\n\nof their retirement. We're going to stop that from happening.\n\nThey haven't put a credible solution on the table. He'll tell\n\nyou about vouchers. He'll say all these things to try and scare\n\npeople. Here's what we're saying: give younger people, when they\n\nbecome Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can't\n\nbe denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then\n\nMedicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people,\n\nmore coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket\n\ncoverage for the poor and the sick.\n\nChoice and competition. We would rather have 50 million future\n\nseniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of\n\n15 bureaucrats deciding what, if, when, where they get it.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah\n\nPalin. It seems every vice presidential debate I hear this kind of\n\nstuff about panels.\n\nBut let's talk about Medicare. What we did is, we saved $716\n\nbillion and put it back, applied it to Medicare. We cut the cost of\n\nMedicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies, doctors and\n\nhospitals. The AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did.\n\nAnd it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this\n\nall out.\n\nIt also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself:\n\nDo you have more benefits today? You do. If you're near the donut\n\nhole, you have $800 - $600 more to help your prescription drug costs.\n\nYou get wellness visits without co-pays. They wipe all of this out,\n\nand Medicare goes - becomes insolvent in 2016, number one.\n\nNumber two, \"guaranteed benefit\"? It's a voucher. When they\n\nfirst proposed - when the congressman had his first voucher program,\n\nthe CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every\n\nsenior, 55 and below, when they got there. He knew that, yet he got\n\nall the guys in Congress and women in the Republican Party to vote for\n\nit. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I would sign it, were I\n\nthere.\n\nWho you believe, the AMA, me, a guy who's fought his whole life\n\nfor this, or somebody who would actually put in motion a plan that\n\nknowingly cut - added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?\n\nNow they got a new plan: \"Trust me, it's not going to cost you\n\nany more.\" Folks, follow your instincts on this one.\n\nAnd with regard to Social Security, we will not - we will not\n\nprivatize it. If we had listened to Romney, Governor Romney, and the\n\ncongressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors\n\nwould be now if their money had been in the market.\n\nTheir ideas are old and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate\n\nthe guarantee of Medicare.\n\nRYAN: Here's the problem. They got caught with their hands in\n\nthe cookie jar, turning Medicare into a piggybank for Obamacare.\n\nTheir own actuary from the administration came to Congress and said\n\none out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of\n\nbusiness as a result of this.\n\nBIDEN: That's not what they said.\n\nRYAN: 7.4 million seniors are projected to lose their current\n\nMedicare Advantage coverage they have. That's a $3,200 benefit cut.\n\nBIDEN: That didn't happen.\n\nRYAN: What we're saying...\n\nBIDEN: More people signed up.\n\nRYAN: These are from your own actuaries.\n\nBIDEN: More - more - more people signed up for Medicare\n\nAdvantage after the change.\n\nRYAN: What - there's...\n\nBIDEN: Nobody is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know...\n\nBIDEN: No, this is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress to\n\nmake up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if\n\nwe don't keep interrupting each other.\n\nBIDEN: Well, don't take all the four minutes then.\n\nRYAN: Let me just - let me just say this. We are not - we're\n\nsaying don't change benefits for people 55 and above. They already\n\norganized their retirement around these promises.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... programs for those of us.\n\nRADDATZ: But let - let me ask you this. What - what is your\n\nspecific plan for seniors who really can't afford to make up the\n\ndifference in the value of what you call a premium support plan and\n\nothers call a voucher?\n\nRYAN: Hundred percent coverage...\n\nRADDATZ: And what...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: That's what we're saying. So we're saying...\n\nRADDATZ: How do you make that up?\n\nRYAN: ... income adjusts (inaudible) these premium support\n\npayments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.\n\nLook, this is a plan - by the way, that $6,400 number, it was\n\nmisleading then, it's totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that's\n\nbipartisan. It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat\n\nsenator from Oregon.\n\nBIDEN: There's not one Democrat who endorses it.\n\nRYAN: It's a plan...\n\nBIDEN: Not one Democrat who (inaudible).\n\nRYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.\n\nBIDEN: And he said he does no longer support (inaudible).\n\nRYAN: We - we - we put it - we put it together with the\n\nformer Clinton budget director.\n\nBIDEN: Who disavows it.\n\nRYAN: This idea - this idea came from the Clinton commission to\n\nsave Medicare chaired by Senator John Breaux.\n\nHere's the point, Martha.\n\nBIDEN: Which was rejected.\n\nRYAN: If we don't - if we don't fix this problem pretty soon\n\nthen current seniors get cut. Here's the problem: 10,000 people are\n\nretiring every single day in America today and they will for 20 years.\n\nThat's not a political thing, that's a math thing.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just - if they\n\njust allowed Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid\n\ncan, that would save $156 billion right off the bat.\n\nRYAN: And it would deny seniors choices.\n\nBIDEN: All - all - all...\n\nRYAN: It has a restricted...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Seniors are not denied.\n\nRYAN: Absolutely.\n\nBIDEN: They are not denied.\n\nLook, folks, all you seniors out there, have you been denied\n\nchoices? Have you lost Medicare Advantage.\n\nRYAN: Because it's working well right now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Because we've changed the law.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me ask you, if it could help\n\nsolve the problem, why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility\n\nage by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests?\n\nBIDEN: Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security\n\nin 1983. I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included\n\nTip O'Neill negotiating with President Reagan. We all got together\n\nand everybody said, as long as everybody's in the deal, everybody's in\n\nthe deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.\n\nWe made the system solvent to 2033. We will not, though, be part\n\nof any voucher plan eliminating - the voucher says, \"Mom, when you're\n\n\u2013 when you're 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can\n\nget. You're out of Medicare.\"\n\nYou can buy back in if you want with this voucher, which will not\n\nkeep pace - will not keep pace with health care costs. Because if it\n\ndid keep pace with health care costs, there would be no savings.\n\nThat's why they go the voucher. They - we will be no part of a\n\nvoucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\n\nRYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check, and buy\n\nsomething. Nobody's proposing that. Barack Obama four years ago\n\nrunning for president said if you don't have any fresh ideas, use\n\nstale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a good record to run\n\non, paint your opponent as someone people should run from.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Make a big election about small ideas.\n\nRADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with\n\nPresident Bush when he was seeking to partially privatize Social\n\nSecurity.\n\nRYAN: For younger people. What we said then, and what I've\n\nalways agreed is let younger Americans have a voluntary choice of\n\nmaking their money work faster for them within the Social Security\n\nsystem.\n\nBIDEN: You saw how well that worked.\n\nRYAN: That's not what Mitt Romney's proposing. What we're\n\nsaying is no changes for anybody 55 and above.\n\nBIDEN: What Mitt Romney is proposing...\n\nRYAN: And then the kinds of changes we're talking about for\n\nyounger people like myself is don't increase the benefits for wealthy\n\npeople as fast as everybody else. Slowly raise the retirement age\n\nover time.\n\nBIDEN: Martha...\n\nRYAN: It wouldn't get to the age of 70 until the year 2103\n\naccording to the actuaries.\n\nNow, here's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President?\n\nBIDEN: Quickly. The bottom line here is that all the studies\n\nshow that if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt\n\nRomney, if you're 40 - in your 40s now you will pay $2,600 a year \u2013\n\nyou get $2,600 a year less in Social Security. If you're in your 20s\n\nnow, you get $4,700 (inaudible) less.\n\nThe idea of changing, and change being in this case to cut the\n\nbenefits for people without taking other action you could do to make\n\nit work is absolutely the wrong way.\n\nThese - look, these guys haven't been big on Medicare from the\n\nbeginning. Their party's not been big on Medicare from the beginning.\n\nAnd they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do.\n\nLook, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this \u2013\n\na man who introduced a bill that would raise it 40 - $6,400 a year;\n\nknowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he'd sign it, or me and\n\nthe president?\n\nRYAN: That statistic was completely misleading. But more\n\nimportantly...\n\nBIDEN: That's - there are the facts right...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: This is what politicians do when they don't have a record\n\nto run on: try to scare people from voting for you. If you don't get\n\nahead of this problem, it's going to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries - there are more beneficiaries...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: We're going to - we're going to move...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: ... very simple question...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We're not going to run away. Medicare and Social Security\n\ndid so much for my own family. We are not going to jeopardize this\n\nprogram, but we have to save it...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: You are jeopardizing this program. You're changing the\n\nprogram from a guaranteed benefit to premium support. Whatever you\n\ncall it, the bottom line is people are going to have to pay more money\n\nout of their pocket and the families I know and the families I come\n\nfrom, they don't have the money to pay more out...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: That's why we're saying more for lower income people and\n\nless for higher income people.\n\nRADDATZ: Gentlemen, I would like to move on to a very simple\n\nquestion for both of you, and something tells me I won't get a very\n\nsimple answer, but let me ask you this.\n\nBIDEN: I gave you a simple answer. He's raising the cost of\n\nMedicare.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will\n\npay more in taxes? Who will pay less? And we're starting with Vice\n\nPresident Biden for two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: The middle class will pay less and people making $1\n\nmillion or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give\n\nyou one concrete example. The continuation of the Bush tax cuts - we\n\nare arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed\n\nto expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million \u2013\n\nbillion of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million.\n\nWe see no justification in these economic times for those, and\n\nthey're patriotic Americans. They're not asking for this continued\n\ntax cut. They're not suggesting it, but my friends are insisting on\n\nit; 120,000 families by continuing that tax cut will get an additional\n\n$500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years and their income is an\n\naverage of $8 million.\n\nWe want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for \u2013\n\npermanently, from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys won't\n\nallow us to. You know what they're saying? We say \"let's have a vote\n\n\u2013 let's have a vote on the middle-class tax cut and let's have a vote\n\non the upper (ph) tax cut; let's go ahead and vote on it.\"\n\nThey're saying no. They're holding hostage the middle class tax\n\ncut to the super wealthy. And on top of that, they've got another tax\n\ncut coming that's $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will\n\nin fact give another $250 million - yeah, $250,000 a year to those\n\n120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle income with\n\na child by $2,000 a year.\n\nThis is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle\n\nclass got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them.\n\nThey need some help now. The last people who need help are 120,000\n\nfamilies for another - another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10\n\nyears.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman?\n\nRYAN: Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow\n\nthe economy and create jobs. It's a plan that's estimated to create 7\n\nmillion jobs. Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a\n\nfamily and business's income is enough. President Obama thinks that\n\nthe government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a\n\nsmall business's income.\n\nRYAN: Look, if you taxed every person and successful business\n\nmaking over $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government\n\nfor 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including\n\nsuccessful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year,\n\nwe'd still have a $300 billion deficit. You see? There aren't enough\n\nrich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending.\n\nAnd so the next time you hear them say, \"Don't worry about it,\n\nwe'll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,\" watch out,\n\nmiddle class, the tax bill's coming to you.\n\nThat's why we're saying we need fundamental tax reform. Let's\n\ntake a look at it this way. Eight out of 10 businesses, they file\n\ntheir taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come\n\nfrom, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped\n\ntheir tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in\n\nthe industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the\n\ntop effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40\n\npercent.\n\nTwo-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax\n\nwould actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It's\n\nexpected to cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn't even\n\npay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases.\n\nWhat we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close\n\nloopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three\n\nbottom lines: Don't raise the deficit, don't raise taxes on the\n\nmiddle class, and don't lower the share of income that is borne by the\n\nhigh-income earners.\n\nHe'll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose. It's been\n\ndiscredited by six other studies. And even their own deputy campaign\n\nmanager acknowledged that it wasn't correct.\n\nRADDATZ: Well, let's talk about this 20 percent. You have\n\nrefused - and, again - to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20\n\npercent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics?\n\nOr are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters?\n\nRYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to\n\nhave big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the...\n\nRADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That would - that would be a first for the Republican\n\nCongress.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you know exactly what you're doing?\n\nRYAN: Look - look at what Mitt Romney - look at what Ronald\n\nReagan and Tip O'Neill did. They worked together out of a framework\n\nto lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to\n\nfix that.\n\nWhat we're saying is, here's our framework. Lower tax rates 20\n\npercent. We raised about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We\n\nforego about $1.1 trillion in loopholes and deductions. And so what\n\nwe're saying is, deny those loopholes and deductions to higher-income\n\ntaxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader\n\nbase of taxation...\n\nBIDEN: Can I translate?\n\nRYAN: ... so we can lower tax rates across the board. Now,\n\nhere's why I'm saying this. What we're saying is, here's the\n\nframework...\n\nBIDEN: I hope I'm going to get time to respond to this.\n\nRADDATZ: You'll get time.\n\nRYAN: We want to work with Congress - we want to work with the\n\nCongress on how best to achieve this. That means successful. Look...\n\nRADDATZ: No specifics, again.\n\nRYAN: Mitt - what we're saying is, lower tax rates 20 percent,\n\nstart with the wealthy, work with Congress to do it...\n\nRADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up?\n\nRYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed - six studies\n\nhave verified that this math adds up. But here's...\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: .. let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate.\n\nRYAN: I'll come back in a second, then, right?\n\nBIDEN: First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks\n\n\u2013 he gave specifics of what he was going to cut, number one, in terms\n\nof tax expenditures. Number two, 97 percent of the small businesses\n\nin America pay less - make less than $250,000.\n\nLet me tell you who some of those other small businesses are:\n\nhedge funds that make $600 million, $800 million a year. That's \u2013\n\nthat's what they count as small businesses, because they're pass-\n\nthrough.\n\nLet's look at how sincere they are. Ronald - I mean, excuse me,\n\nGovernor Romney on \"60 Minutes\" - I guess it was about 10 days ago \u2013\n\nmaking $50,000 pays more than that. Do you think that's fair?\" He\n\nsaid, \"Oh, yes, that's fair. That's fair.\"\n\nThis is - and they're going to talk - you think these guys are\n\ngoing to go out there and cut those loopholes? The loophole - the\n\nbiggest loophole they take advantage of is the carried interest\n\nloophole and - and capital gains loophole. They exempt that.\n\nBIDEN: Now, there's not enough - the reason why the AEI study,\n\nthe American Enterprise Institute study, the Tax Policy Center study,\n\nthe reason they all say it's going - taxes go up on the middle class,\n\nthe only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the mortgage\n\ndeduction for middle-class people, cut the health care deduction,\n\nmiddle-class people, take away their ability to get a tax break to\n\nsend their kids to college. That's why they arrive at it.\n\nRADDATZ: Is he wrong about that?\n\nRYAN: He is wrong about that. They're...\n\nBIDEN: How's that?\n\nRYAN: You can - you can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still\n\npreserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers...\n\nBIDEN: Not mathematically possible.\n\nRYAN: It is mathematically possible. It's been done before.\n\nIt's precisely what we're proposing.\n\nBIDEN: It has never been done before.\n\nRYAN: It's been done a couple of times, actually.\n\nBIDEN: It has never been done before.\n\nRYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald\n\nReagan...\n\nBIDEN: Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRYAN: Ronald Reagan - Republicans and Democrats...\n\nBIDEN: This is amazing.\n\nRYAN: Republican and Democrats have worked together on this.\n\nBIDEN: That's right.\n\nRYAN: You know, I understand you guys aren't used to doing\n\nbipartisan deals...\n\nBIDEN: But we told each other what we're going to do.\n\nRYAN: Republicans and Democrats...\n\nBIDEN: When we did it Reagan, we said, here - here are the\n\nthings we're going to cut.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's what we said.\n\nRYAN: We said here's the framework, let's work together to fill\n\nin the details. That's exactly...\n\nBIDEN: Fill in the detail.\n\nRYAN: That's how you get things done. You work with Congress \u2013\n\nlook, let me say it this way.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's coming from a Republican Congress working\n\nbipartisanly, 7 percent rating? Come on.\n\nRYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87\n\npercent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats. He didn't\n\ndemonize them. He didn't demagogue them. He met with those party\n\nleaders every week. He reached across the aisle. He didn't\n\ncompromise principles.\n\nBIDEN: And you saw what happened.\n\nRYAN: He found common ground - and he balanced the budget...\n\nBIDEN: You saw - if he did such a great job...\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Vice President...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... four times without raising taxes...\n\nBIDEN: Why isn't he even contesting Massachusetts?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Vice President, what would you suggest - what\n\nwould you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy, that would\n\nsubstantially reduce the long-term deficit?\n\nBIDEN: Just let the taxes expire like they're supposed to on\n\nthose millionaires. We don't - we can't afford $800 billion going to\n\npeople making a minimum of $1 million. They do not need it, Martha.\n\nThose 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people\n\nneed the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for\n\nthem? Why does he go after the childcare...\n\nRADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?\n\nBIDEN: Why do they do that?\n\nRADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?\n\nRYAN: Yeah, we're saying close loopholes...\n\nRADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?\n\nRYAN: ... on high-interest people.\n\nRADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?\n\nRYAN: For higher-income people. Here...\n\nBIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000\n\nwill have a mortgage - their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?\n\nRYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to\n\nmake you think that it's just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an\n\nactor...\n\nBIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less\n\nthan $250,000 a year, would not be affected.\n\nRYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million - this taxes a million\n\npeople, a million small businesses.\n\nBIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?\n\nRYAN: It taxes a million small businesses...\n\nBIDEN: Small businesses?\n\nRYAN: ... who are our greatest job creators.\n\nBIDEN: I wish I'd get - the \"greatest job creators\" are the\n\nhedge fund guys.\n\nRADDATZ: And you're - and you're going to increase the defense\n\nbudget.\n\nRYAN: Think about it this way.\n\nRADDATZ: And you're going to increase the defense budget.\n\nRYAN: No, we're not just going to cut the defense budget like\n\nthey're - they're proposing...\n\nBIDEN: They're going to increase it $2 billion.\n\nRYAN: That's not...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We're talking about...\n\nRADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?\n\nRYAN: No, we're saying don't - OK, you want to get into defense\n\nnow?\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that's another math question.\n\nRYAN: So - right, OK.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you do that?\n\nRYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin\n\nwith. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that's lurking\n\non the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the\n\ndebt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut...\n\nRADDATZ: Let's put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?\n\nRYAN: Right, OK.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's put those aside. No one wants that.\n\nBIDEN: I'd like to go back to that.\n\nRADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this\n\nincrease in defense spending?\n\nBIDEN: Two trillion dollars.\n\nRYAN: You don't cut defense by a trillion dollars. That's what\n\nwe're talking about.\n\nRADDATZ: And what - what national security issues justify an\n\nincrease?\n\nBIDEN: Who's cutting it by $1 trillion?\n\nRYAN: We're going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120\n\ncargo planes. We're going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out...\n\nRADDATZ: Drawing down in one war and one war...\n\nRYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the smallest \u2013\n\nthe smallest it has been since before World War I.\n\nThis invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through\n\nstrength? You bet we do. And that means you don't impose these\n\ndevastating cuts on our military.\n\nSo we're saying don't cut the military by a trillion dollars.\n\nNot increase it by a trillion, don't cut it by a trillion dollars.\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden on this. I want to move\n\non.\n\nBIDEN: Look, we don't cut it. And I might add, this so-called\n\n\u2013 I know we don't want to use the fancy word \"sequester,\" this\n\nAnd let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference\n\nannouncing his support of the deal. He said, and I'm paraphrase,\n\nWe've been looking for this moment for a long time.\n\nRYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.\n\nBIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the\n\nautomatic cuts in defense if they didn't act.\n\nsays we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces, we\n\nneed - we don't need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs.\n\nRADDATZ: Some of the military.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Not some of the military. That was the decision of the\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the\n\npresident. That is a fact.\n\nRADDATZ: Who answers to a civilian leader.\n\nBIDEN: They made the recommendation first.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Let's move on to Afghanistan.\n\nRYAN: Can I get into that for a second?\n\nRADDATZ: I'd like to move on to Afghanistan please. And that's\n\none of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars, and\n\nmore importantly in lives.\n\nWe just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops\n\nthere in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the\n\nvery Afghan forces we are trying to help.\n\nNow, we've reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces, we've\n\ndegraded Al Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we\n\nreally accomplish? Is it worth more American lives?\n\nRYAN: We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten. We want to\n\nmake sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give Al Qaida a\n\nsafe haven.\n\nWe agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.\n\nLook, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the\n\nincredible job that our troops have done. You've been there more than\n\nthe two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was\n\namazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph)\n\nValley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private\n\nin the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell\n\nme what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had\n\nin front of them.\n\nAnd then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand\n\nwith the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, it's nothing\n\nshort of amazing.\n\nWhat we don't want to do is lose the gains we've gotten. Now,\n\nwe've disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have\n\nmore likely taken into accounts the recommendations from our\n\ncommanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels\n\nthroughout this year's fighting season. We've been skeptical about\n\nnegotiations with the Taliban, especially while they're shooting at\n\nus.\n\nBut we want to see the 2014 transition be successful, and that\n\nmeans we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make\n\nsure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a\n\nlaunching pad for terrorists.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Martha, let's keep our eye on the ball. The reason \u2013\n\nI've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times. I've been up\n\nin the Konar (ph) Valley. I've been throughout that whole country,\n\nmostly in a helicopter, and sometimes in a vehicle.\n\nThe fact is, we went there for one reason: to get those people\n\nwho killed Americans, Al Qaida. We've decimated Al Qaida central. We\n\nhave eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.\n\nAnd, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would\n\nhelp train the Afghan military. It's their responsibility to take\n\nover their own security. That's why with 49 of our allies in\n\nAfghanistan, we've agreed on a gradual drawdown so we're out of there\n\nby the year 20 - in the year 2014.\n\nMy friend and the governor say it's based on conditions, which\n\nmeans it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the\n\nresponsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We\n\nhave trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been\n\nmore than two dozen cases of green-on-blue where Americans have been\n\nkilled. If we do not - if the measures the military has taken do not\n\ntake hold, we will not go on joint patrols. We will not train in the\n\nfield. We'll only train in the - in the Army bases that exist there.\n\nBut we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period. And in the\n\nprocess, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800\n\nbillion. We've been in this war for over a decade. The primary\n\nobjective is almost completed. Now, all we're doing is putting the\n\nKabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own\n\nsecurity.\n\nIt's their responsibility, not America's.\n\nRADDATZ: What - what conditions could justify staying,\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We don't want to stay. We want - look, one of my best\n\nfriends in Janesville, a reservist, is at a forward-operating base in\n\neastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives are best friends. Our\n\ndaughters are best friends. I want - I want him and all of our\n\ntroops to come home as soon and safely as possible.\n\nWe want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That's why we want\n\nto make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to\n\nmake it successful. We don't want to extend beyond 2014. That's the\n\npoint we're making.\n\nYou know, if it was just this, I'd feel like we would - we would\n\nbe able to call this a success, but it's not. What we are witnessing\n\nas we turn on our television screens these days is the absolute\n\nunraveling of the Obama foreign policy. Problems are growing at home,\n\nbut - problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren't growing here at\n\nhome.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says we're absolutely\n\nleaving in 2014. You're saying that's not an absolute, but you won't\n\ntalk about what conditions would justify...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Do you know why we say that?\n\nBIDEN: I'd like to know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Because we don't want to broadcast to our enemies \"put a\n\ndate on your calendar, wait us out, and then come back.\" We want to\n\nmake sure...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline.\n\nRYAN: We do agree - we do agree with the timeline and the\n\ntransition, but what we - what any administration will do in 2013 is\n\nassess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline. What\n\nwe do not want to do...\n\nBIDEN: We will leave in 2014.\n\nRYAN: ... what we don't want to do is give our allies reason to\n\ntrust us less and our enemies more - we don't want to embolden our\n\nenemies to hold and wait out for us and then take over...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Martha, that's a bizarre statement.\n\nRYAN: That's why we want to make sure - no, that's why we want\n\nto make sure that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Forty-nine of our allies - hear me - 49 of our allies\n\nsigned on to this position.\n\nRYAN: And we're reading that they want to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Forty-nine - 49 of our allies said \"out in 2014.\" It's\n\nthe responsibility of the Afghans. We have other responsibilities...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Do you really think that this timeline...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Which is - which is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: We have - we have soldiers and Marines. We have\n\nAfghan forces murdering our forces over there. The Taliban is, do you\n\nthink, taking advantage of this timeline?\n\nBIDEN: Look, the Taliban - what we've found out, and we - you\n\nsaw it in Iraq, Martha, unless you set a timeline, Baghdad, in the\n\ncase of Iraq, and - and Kabul, in the case of Afghanistan will not\n\nstep up. They're happy to let us continue to do the job;\n\ninternational security forces to do the job.\n\nThe only way they step up is to say, \"Fellas, we're leaving;\n\nwe've trained you; step up, step up.\"\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back.\n\nBIDEN: That's the only way it works.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back to the - the surge troops that we put\n\nin there. And - and you brought this up, Congressman Ryan. I have\n\ntalked to a lot of troops. I've talked to senior offices who were\n\nconcerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting\n\nseason, and some of them saw that as a political - as a political\n\nmove. So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military\n\nreason for bringing those surge troops home...\n\nBIDEN: The military reason...\n\nRADDATZ: ... before the fighting had ended?\n\nBIDEN: ... was bringing - by the way, when the president\n\nannounced the surge, you'll remember, Martha, he said the surge will\n\nbe out by the end of the summer. The military said the surge will be\n\nout. Nothing political about this.\n\nBefore the surge occurred - so you be a little straight with me\n\nhere, too - before the surge occurred, we said they'll be out by the\n\nend of the summer. That's what the military said. The reason for\n\nthat is...\n\nRADDATZ: The military follows orders. I mean, there - trust\n\nme. There are people who were concerned about pulling out on the\n\nfighting season.\n\nBIDEN: Sure. There are people that are concerned, but not the\n\nJoint Chiefs. That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the\n\npresident of the United States of America. I sat there. I'm sure\n\nyou'll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon. I'm positive\n\nyou'll find that within the military. But that's not the case here.\n\nAnd, secondly, the reason why the military said that is, you\n\ncannot wait and have a cliff. It takes - you know - months and\n\nmonths and months to draw down forces.\n\nRYAN: Let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think\n\nthis - it can get a little confusing. We've all met with General\n\nAllen and General Scaparrotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting\n\nseasons.\n\nHere's the way it works. The mountain passes fill in with snow.\n\nThe Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura\n\ncome over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in\n\nwith snow, they can't do it. That's what we call fighting seasons.\n\nIn the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes\n\ndown.\n\nAnd so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress\n\nand said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is\n\nend, it puts people more at risk. That's the problem.\n\nYes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month, but the remaining\n\ntroops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute\n\ncounterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people. That makes them\n\nless safe.\n\nBIDEN: Fighting season...\n\nRYAN: We're sending fewer people out in all of these hotspots to\n\ndo the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago.\n\nBIDEN: Because we turned it over...\n\nRYAN: But we took 22,000 people out...\n\nBIDEN: ... we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained.\n\nNo one got pulled out that didn't get filled in by trained Afghan\n\npersonnel. And he's - he's conflating two issues. The fighting\n\nseason that Petraeus was talking about and former - and Admiral\n\nMullen was the fighting season this spring. That's what he was\n\ntalking about. We did not - we did not pull them out.\n\nRYAN: The calendar works the same every year.\n\nBIDEN: It does work the same every year. But we're not staying\n\nthere...\n\nRYAN: Spring, summer, fall. It's warm, or it's not. They're\n\nstill fighting us. They're still coming over the passes. They're\n\nstill coming into Zabul, to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are\n\nsending fewer people to the front to fight them. And that's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's right, because that's the Afghan responsibility.\n\nWe've trained them.\n\nRYAN: Not in the east.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move - let's move to another war.\n\nBIDEN: Not in the east?\n\nRYAN: R.C. East - R.C. East...\n\nBIDEN: R.C. East is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nRYAN: That's right. That's why we don't want to send fewer\n\npeople to the...\n\nBIDEN: That's - that's why we should send Americans in to do\n\nthe job, instead of the - you'd rather Americans be going in doing\n\nthe job instead of the trainees?\n\nRYAN: No. We are already sending Americans to do the job, but\n\nfewer of them. That's the whole problem.\n\nBIDEN: That's right. We're sending in more Afghans to do the\n\njob, Afghans to do the job.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move to another war, the civil war in Syria,\n\nwhere there are estimates that more - estimates that more than\n\n25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year,\n\nPresident Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying\n\nit was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres\n\nfrom occurring there. So why doesn't the same logic apply in Syria?\n\nVice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Different country. It's a different country. It is five\n\ntimes as large geographically, it has one-fifth the population, that\n\nis Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large\n\ngeographically.\n\nIt's in a part of the world where they're not going to see\n\nwhatever would come from that war. It seep into a regional war.\n\nYou're in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the\n\nmost dangerous area in the world. And, in fact, if in fact it blows\n\nup and the wrong people gain control, it's going to have impact on the\n\nentire region causing potentially regional wars.\n\nWe are working hand and glove with the Turks, with the\n\nJordanians, with the Saudis, and with all the people in the region\n\nattempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when\n\nAssad goes - and he will go - there will be a legitimate government\n\nthat follows on, not an Al Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.\n\nAnd all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the\n\ncongressman, about how we're going to do, we could do so much more in\n\nthere, what more would they do other than put American boots on the\n\nground?\n\nThe last thing America needs is to get in another ground war in\n\nthe Middle East, requiring tens of thousands, if not well over 100,000\n\nAmerican forces. That - they are the facts. They are the facts.\n\nanything. He - he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he\n\ngets pressed he says, no, he would not do anything different than we\n\nare doing now.\n\nAre they proposing putting American troops on the ground?\n\nPutting American aircraft in the airspace? Is that what they're\n\nproposing? If they do, they should speak up and say so, but that's\n\nnot what they're saying.\n\nWe are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those\n\nforces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not\n\ncause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (sic) - when Bashar Assad\n\nfalls.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria. American\n\ntroops.\n\nNow, let me say it this way. How would we do things differently?\n\nWe wouldn't refer to Bashar Assad as a reformer when he's killing his\n\nown civilians with his Russian-provided weapons. We wouldn't be\n\noutsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations giving Vladimir\n\nPutin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue.\n\nHe's vetoed three of them.\n\nHillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince them not to do\n\nso. They thwarted her efforts. She said they were on the wrong side\n\nof history. She was right about that. This is just one more example\n\nof how the Russia reset's not working.\n\nAnd so where are we? After international pressure mounted, the\n\nPresident Obama said Bashar Assad should go. It's been over a year.\n\nThe man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people. And more\n\nforeign fighters are spilling into this country.\n\nSo the longer this has gone on, the more people, groups like Al\n\nQaida are going in. We could have more easily identified the free\n\nSyrian army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks,\n\nthe Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin\n\nwith working through our allies. But, no, we waited for Kofi Annan to\n\ntry and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar\n\nAssad time.\n\nWe gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. And\n\nmeanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.\n\nBIDEN: What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he\n\nnever answers the question.\n\nRYAN: No, I would - I - we would not be going through the U.N.\n\nin all of these things.\n\nBIDEN: Let me - you don't go through the U.N. We are in the\n\nprocess now - and have been for months - in making sure that help,\n\nhumanitarian aid, as well as other aid and training is getting to\n\nthose forces that we believe, the Turks believe, the Jordanians\n\nbelieve, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria. That\n\nis underway.\n\nOur allies were all on the same page, NATO, as well as our Arab\n\nallies, in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea.\n\nWe're the ones that said, \"Enough.\"\n\nWith regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is\n\nthat Russia has a different interest in Syria than we do, and that's\n\nnot in our interest.\n\nRADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not fall, Congressman Ryan?\n\nWhat happens to the region? What happens if he hangs on? What\n\nhappens if he does?\n\nRYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region. He's a\n\nsponsor of terrorism. He'll probably continue slaughtering his\n\npeople. We and the world community will lose our credibility on this.\n\nLook, he mentioned the reset...\n\nRADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?\n\nRYAN: Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do\n\non chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in, other than to\n\nsecure those chemical weapons. They're right about that.\n\nBut what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom\n\nfighters, those dissidents in Syria. We should not have called Bashar\n\nAssad a reformer. And...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... we should not have - we should not have waited to\n\nRussia...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... should not have waited for Russia to give us the green\n\nlight at the U.N. to do something about it.\n\nBIDEN: Russia...\n\nRYAN: They're - they're still arming the man. Iran is flying\n\nflights over Iraq...\n\nBIDEN: And the opposition is being armed.\n\nRYAN: ... to help Bashar Assad. And, by the way, if we had the\n\nstatus-of-forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet\n\nhis vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to\n\nprevent that. But he failed to achieve that, as well, again.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me ask you a quick question.\n\nBIDEN: I don't...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria for intervention?\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: In Syria?\n\nRADDATZ: Worldwide.\n\nRYAN: What is in the national interests of the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: How about humanitarian interests?\n\nRYAN: What is in the national security of the American people.\n\nIt's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.\n\nRADDATZ: No humanitarian?\n\nRYAN: Each situation will - will come up with its own set of\n\ncircumstances, but putting American troops on the ground? That's got\n\nto be within the national security interests of the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to - we're - we're almost out of time here.\n\nRYAN: That means like embargoes and sanctions and overflights,\n\nthose are things that don't put American troops on the ground. But if\n\nyou're talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in\n\nour national security interests.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want to return home for these\n\nlast few questions. This debate is, indeed, historic. We have two\n\nCatholic candidates, first time, on a stage such as this. And I would\n\nlike to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in\n\nyour own personal views on abortion.\n\nPlease talk about how you came to that decision. Talk about how\n\nyour religion played a part in that. And, please, this is such an\n\nemotional issue for so many people in this country...\n\nRYAN: Sure.\n\nRADDATZ: ... please talk personally about this, if you could.\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: I don't see how a person can separate their public life\n\nfrom their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in\n\neverything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the\n\nvulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\n\nRYAN: Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life? It's not\n\nsimply because of my Catholic faith. That's a factor, of course. But\n\nit's also because of reason and science.\n\nYou know, I think about 10 1\/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I\n\nwent to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven\n\nweek ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A\n\nlittle baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have\n\nnicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \"Bean.\" Now I believe that life\n\nbegins at conception.\n\nThat's why - those are the reasons why I'm pro-life. Now I\n\nunderstand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don't\n\nagree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will\n\nbe to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life\n\nof the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has\n\nhandled all of these issues. Look at what they're doing through\n\nObamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this\n\ncountry. They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of\n\nreligion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches,\n\nCatholic hospitals.\n\nOur church should not have to sue our federal government to\n\nmaintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the\n\nDemocratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and\n\nrare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer\n\nfunding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign\n\naid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he\n\nsympathized and wouldn't second guess their one child policy of forced\n\nabortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: My religion defines who I am, and I've been a practicing\n\nCatholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social\n\ndoctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of\n\nthose who - who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.\n\nWith regard to - with regard to abortion, I accept my church's\n\nposition on abortion as a - what we call a (inaudible) doctrine.\n\nLife begins at conception in the church's judgment. I accept it in my\n\npersonal life.\n\nBut I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and\n\nMuslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike\n\nmy friend here, the - the congressman. I - I do not believe that we\n\nhave a right to tell other people that - women they can't control\n\ntheir body. It's a decision between them and their doctor. In my\n\nview and the Supreme Court, I'm not going to interfere with that.\n\nWith regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it\n\nabsolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise,\n\nincluding Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy\n\nHospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none\n\nhas to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get\n\ncontraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact.\n\nThat is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the - we\n\ndiffer, my friend says that he - well I guess he accepts Governor\n\nRomney's position now, because in the past he has argued that there\n\nwas - there's rape and forcible rape. He's argued that in the case\n\nof rape or incest, it was still - it would be a crime to engage in\n\nhaving an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.\n\nRYAN: All I'm saying is, if you believe that life begins at\n\nconception, that, therefore, doesn't change the definition of life.\n\nThat's a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to\n\noppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the\n\nmother.\n\nNow, I've got to take issue with the Catholic church and\n\nreligious liberty.\n\nBIDEN: You have on the issue...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... why would they keep - why would they keep suing you?\n\nIt's a distinction without a difference.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion question here. If\n\nthe Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that\n\nabortion should remain legal be worried?\n\nRYAN: We don't think that unelected judges should make this\n\ndecision; that people through their elected representatives in\n\nreaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should\n\nmake this determination.\n\nBIDEN: The court - the next president will get one or two\n\nSupreme Court nominees. That's how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask\n\nyourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for \u2013\n\nfor Mr. Romney, who do you think he's likely to appoint? Do you think\n\nhe's likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the\n\ncourt far right that would outlaw (inaudible) - outlaw abortion? I\n\nsuspect that would happen.\n\nI guarantee you, that will not happen. We picked two people. We\n\npick people who are open-minded. They've been good justices. So keep\n\nan eye on the Supreme Court...\n\nRYAN: Was there a litmus test on them?\n\nBIDEN: There was no litmus test. We picked people who had an\n\nopen mind; did not come with an agenda.\n\nRADDATZ: I'm - I'm going to move on to this closing question\n\nbecause we are running out of time.\n\nCertainly (inaudible) and you've said it here tonight, that the\n\ntwo of you respect our troops enormously. Your son has served and\n\nperhaps someday your children will serve as well.\n\nI recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this\n\npresidential campaign has left him dismayed. He told me, quote, \"the\n\nads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other rather\n\nthan building up the country.\"\n\nWhat would you say to that American hero about this campaign?\n\nAnd at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?\n\nVice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I would say to him the same thing I say to my son who did\n\nserve a year in Iraq, that we only have one truly sacred obligation as\n\na government. That's to equip those we send into harm's way and care\n\nfor those who come home. That's the only sacred obligation we have.\n\nEverything else falls behind that.\n\nI would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated\n\nsoldier you talked about, fought for his country, that that should be\n\nhonored. He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who\n\ndon't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having\n\nto pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility.\n\nI would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in\n\nthis campaign and occur in every campaign that I'm sure both of us\n\nregret anyone having said, particularly in these - these special new\n\ngroups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have\n\nto identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the\n\nother candidate. It's - it's an abomination.\n\nBut the bottom line here is I'd ask that hero you referenced to\n\ntake a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has\n\nthe conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where\n\nthey were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out. Or\n\nwhether or not he's going to continue to focus on taking care of only\n\nthe very wealthy, not asking them to make - pay any part of the deal\n\nto bring - bring back the middle class and the economy of this\n\ncountry.\n\nI'd ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United\n\nStates has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the\n\nslipshod comments being made by my - my - or by Governor Romney\n\nserve - serve our interests very well.\n\nBut there are things that have been said in campaigns that I - I\n\nfind not very appealing.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: First of all, I'd thank him to his service to our country.\n\nSecond of all, I'd say we are not going to impose these\n\ndevastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and\n\ntheir safety.\n\nAnd then I would say, you have a president who ran for president\n\nfour years ago promising hope and change, who has now turned his\n\ncampaign into attack, blame and defame.\n\nYou see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you\n\npaint your opponent as someone to run from. That was what President\n\nObama said in 2008. It's what he's doing right now.\n\nLook at all the string of broken promises. If you like your\n\nhealth care plan, you can keep it. Try telling that to the 20 million\n\npeople who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare\n\ngoes through or the 7-point million - 7.4 million seniors who are\n\ngoing to lose it.\n\nOr remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than\n\n$250,000, your taxes won't go up. Of the 21 tax increases in\n\nObamacare, 12 of them hit the middle class.\n\nOr remember when he said health insurance premiums will go down\n\n$2,500 per family, per year? They've gone up $3,000, and they're\n\nexpected to go up another $2,400.\n\nOr remember when he said, \"I promise by the end of my first term\n\nI'll cut the deficit in half in four years\"? We've had four budgets,\n\nfour trillion-dollar deficits.\n\nA debt crisis is coming. We can't keep spending and borrowing\n\nlike this. We can't keep spending money we don't have.\n\nLeaders run to problem to fix problems. President Obama has not\n\neven put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal\n\nwith this debt crisis. I passed two budgets to deal with this. Mitt\n\nRomney's put ideas on the table.\n\nWe've got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us. The\n\nbudget office, \"Can we see the plan?\" They sent us to the press\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"Tell us what President Obama's plan is\n\nto prevent a debt crisis.\" They said, \"It's a speech, we can't\n\nestimate speeches.\"\n\nYou see, that's what we get in this administration - speeches \u2013\n\nbut we're not getting leadership.\n\nMitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His\n\nlifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship.\n\nAnd what do we have from the president? He broke his big promise\n\nto bring people together to solve the country's biggest problems.\n\nAnd what I would tell him is we don't have to settle for this.\n\nBIDEN: Martha?\n\nRYAN: We can do better than this.\n\nBIDEN: I hope I'll get equal time.\n\nRADDATZ: You will get just a few minutes here. A few seconds,\n\nreally.\n\nBIDEN: The two budgets the congressman introduced have\n\neviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about. It is\n\n(inaudible) he will knock 19 million people off of Medicare. It will\n\nkick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate the\n\ntax credit people have to be able to send their children to college.\n\nIt cuts education by $450 billion.\n\nIt does - it does virtually nothing except continue to increase\n\nthe tax cuts for the very wealthy. And, you know, we've had enough of\n\nthis.\n\nThe idea that he's so concerned about these deficits, I've\n\npointed out he voted to put two wars on a credit card. He did...\n\nRADDATZ: We're going to - we're going to the closing statements\n\nin a minute.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You're going to have your closing statement.\n\nRYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way,\n\nour budget...\n\nBIDEN: We have not raised...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... by 3 percent a year instead of 4.5 percent like they\n\npropose. Not spending more money as much as they say is not a\n\nspending cut.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me - let me calm down things here just for a\n\nminute. And I want to talk to you very briefly before we go to\n\nclosing statements about your own personal character. If you are\n\nelected, what could you both give to this country as a man, as a human\n\nbeing, that no one else could?\n\nRYAN: Honesty, no one else could? There are plenty of fine\n\npeople who could lead this country. But what you need are people who,\n\nwhen they say they're going to do something, they go do it. What you\n\nneed are, when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those\n\nproblems. We're not getting that.\n\nLook, we can grow this economy faster. That's what our five-\n\npoint plan for a stronger middle class is all about. It's about\n\ngetting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay, getting people out of\n\npoverty into the middle class. That means going with proven, pro-\n\ngrowth policies that we know works to get people back to work.\n\nPutting ideas on the table, working with Democrats - that actually\n\nworks sometimes - and then...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President, can we get to that - to that issue of\n\nwhat you could bring as a man, a human being? And I really - I'm\n\ngoing to keep you to about 15 seconds here.\n\nBIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I get 15, that's OK.\n\nRADDATZ: He didn't have 40. He didn't have 40.\n\nBIDEN: That's all right.\n\nLet me tell you. I - my - my record stands for itself. I\n\nnever say anything I don't mean. Everybody knows, whatever I say, I\n\ndo. And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field\n\nfor middle-class people, giving them an even break, treating Main\n\nStreet and Wall Street the same, hold them to the same responsibility.\n\nLook at my record. It's been all about the middle class.\n\nThey're the people who grow this country. We think you grow this\n\ncountry from the middle out, not from the top down.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we now turn to the candidates for their closing\n\nstatements. Thank you, gentlemen. And that coin toss, again, has\n\nVice President Biden starting with the closing statement.\n\nBIDEN: Well, let - let me say at the outset that I want to\n\nthank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College. The fact is\n\nthat we're in a situation where we inherited a god-awful circumstance.\n\nPeople are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring relief to the\n\npeople who need the most help now.\n\nAnd - and in the process, we - in case you haven't noticed, we\n\nhave strong disagreements, but I - you probably detected my\n\nfrustration with their attitude about the American people. My friend\n\nsays that 30 percent of the American people are takers. Romney points\n\nout 47 percent of the people won't take responsibility.\n\nHe's talking about my mother and father. He's talking about the\n\nplaces I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont, and he's\n\ntalking about - he's talking about the people that have built this\n\ncountry. All they're looking for, Martha, all they're looking for is\n\nan even shot. Whenever you give them the shot, they've done it.\n\nThey've done it. Whenever you've leveled the playing field, they've\n\nbeen able to move. And they want a little bit of peace of mind.\n\nAnd the president and I are not going to rest until that playing\n\nfield is leveled, they, in fact, have a clear shot, and they have\n\npeace of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree\n\nof confidence, \"Honey, it's going to be OK. It's going to be OK.\"\n\nThat's what this is all about.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: I want to thank you, as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky,\n\nCentre College, and I want to thank you, Joe. It's been an honor to\n\nengage in this critical debate.\n\nWe face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to\n\nbe? What kind of country are we going to give our kids? President\n\nObama, he had his chance. He made his choices. His economic agenda,\n\nmore spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of\n\nhealth care. It's not working. It's failed to create the jobs we\n\nneed.\n\nTwenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today.\n\nFifteen percent of Americans are in poverty. This is not what a real\n\nrecovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to\n\nearn your support. We're offering real reforms for a real recovery\n\nfor every American.\n\nMitt Romney - his experience, his ideas, his solutions - is\n\nuniquely qualified to get this job done. At a time when we have a\n\njobs crisis in America, wouldn't it be nice to have a job-creator in\n\nthe White House?\n\nThe choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more\n\ngovernment dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes\n\nopportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough\n\nissues, and we will not blame others for the next four years. We will\n\ntake responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding\n\nprinciples. We will reapply our founding principles.\n\nThe choice is clear, and the choice rests with you. And we ask\n\nyou for your vote. Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank you very much.\n\nBIDEN: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential debate. Please\n\ntune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate at Hofstra\n\nUniversity in New York. I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope\n\nall of you go to the polls. Have a good evening.\n\n(APPLAUSE)",

    "text":"Breaking down barriers for African Americans Hillary Clinton \u00b7 Follow Published in Hillary for America \u00b7 \u00b7 Feb 17, 2016 18 min read -- 18 Listen Share\n\nThank you so much Charlie [Rangel]. Thanks for your friendship. Thanks for your leadership. The Congress will miss you when you leave its ranks, but I have a feeling that you are going to be spending a lot of time right here in Harlem. Charlie didn\u2019t tell you the whole story.\n\nHe was actually the person who called to encourage me to run for the Senate. He basically said that I had no choice. But it took me a long time before I realized he was right. He\u2019s been a great friend and partner since then.\n\nI want to tell you how special it is for me to be back here in Harlem to make this set of comments. I loved representing New York for eight years. And Harlem looms large in the American imagination, as the birthplace of so much art and culture and such vibrant public life. There\u2019s really no place like it in the world.\n\nI appreciate being joined by the Governor [Cuomo] and Sandra, by the Mayor [De Blasio] and Chirlane, by the former Attorney General, Eric Holder, Representative Yvette Clark, and Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, our Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, Public Advocate Letitia James. I want to thank Dr. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, and to all of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian caucus members and members of the New York City Council. The Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus: I thank you all so much for being here.\n\nI want to pick up on what I just said about Harlem, because Harlem, and many other communities across America, remind us that any view of Black America that focuses exclusively on crime, poverty, or other challenges is missing so much. Missing the strength and the pride and the achievement that is evident on every street here.\n\nThat narrative is missing the remarkable rise of the African American middle class, the rise of African American \u2026 leadership in all walks of life: in business, law, politics, science, the arts, sports, and all the professions. It\u2019s missing the vibrancy of the black church, the passionate advocacy of the next generation of changemakers, and the service of leaders at every level, who never tire of making others\u2019 lives better.\n\nEarlier today, I spent some time with the heads of nine of America\u2019s historic civil rights groups, hosted by Marc Morial of the National Urban League. Reverend Al Sharpton attended. And we had a great conversation, because they are working to drive a 21st century agenda for jobs and freedom. I am grateful for their guidance and wisdom. I am also grateful to be speaking in this building that honors two men who represent just some of the diversity of the African American community.\n\nArturo Schomburg, who was from the Caribbean, and Langston Hughes, whose ashes are housed here, reminded all of us that when life ain\u2019t no crystal stair, you\u2019ve got to keep climbing. That\u2019s a good lesson for everyone.\n\nBut even as we acknowledge and even celebrate successes, it\u2019s important to remember: There are still very real barriers holding back African Americans from fully participating in our society. That\u2019s what I am here to talk about today.\n\nLast week on the debate stage in Milwaukee, I said I want to tear down all the barriers that hold back Americans across racial lines, because our country can only live up to its potential when every single American has the chance to live up to theirs. So I want to talk with you about how we break down the barriers that disproportionately affect African Americans and build ladders of opportunity in their place.\n\nLast week, I went to Flint, Michigan. By now, we all know what\u2019s happening there. Families, children, babies, drinking poisoned water for nearly two years because their government wanted to save a little money. It\u2019s a horrifying story, but what makes it even worse is that it\u2019s not a coincidence that this was allowed to happen in a largely black, largely poor community. Just ask yourself, would this have ever occurred in a wealthy white suburb of Detroit? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd as we have learned more about this crisis, we\u2019ve seen other barriers holding back the people of Flint coming into clearer focus.\n\nYears of under-investment have left behind a hollowed out community without enough jobs or opportunity for the people living there. Not enough families have access to the quality education that their children deserve. And they have too little political power, which left them vulnerable to a state government that ignored and dismissed their concerns.\n\nJust imagine \u2014 every one of you a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle \u2014 going to the authorities holding a bottle of brown, smelly water. Telling those in authority, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this water. My baby has a rash. I feel funny when I drink it or take a bath,\u201d and being told, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the water. Just go away.\u201d\n\nFlint is not alone. There are many Flints across our country: places where people of color and the poor have been left out and left behind.\n\nNow, in the contest for the Democratic nomination, we have spent a lot of time debating about the big banks and the excesses of Wall Street, and these are important issues. And I am absolutely committed to ensuring that no bank is too big to fail, and no executive too powerful to jail.\n\nBut Flint reminds us there\u2019s a lot more going on in our country that we should be concerned about. The truth is we aren\u2019t a single-issue country. We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges.\n\nThey are intersectional, they are reinforcing, and we have got to take them all on.\n\nSo it\u2019s not enough for your economic plan to be, \u201cbreak up the banks.\u201d You also need a serious plan to create jobs, especially in places where unemployment remains stubbornly high. You need a plan to address the generations of underinvestment and neglect.\n\nNow even if we succeed on raising taxes on every millionaire and billionaire in America \u2014 and believe me, I do intend to succeed at that \u2014 we still need to face the painful reality that African Americans are nearly three times as likely as whites to be denied a mortgage. Something\u2019s wrong when the median wealth for black families is just a tiny fraction of the median wealth of white families.\n\nAnd when gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined, there is something deeply wrong.\n\nSomething is wrong when African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men convicted of the same offenses. And when black kids get arrested for petty crimes, but white CEO\u2019s get away with fleecing our entire country, there is something wrong.\n\nJust imagine with me, for a minute, if white kids were 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than black kids. Five hundred percent. Imagine if a white baby in South Carolina were twice as likely to die before her first birthday than an African American baby. Imagine the outcry. Imagine the resources that would flood in.\n\nNow, these inequities are wrong \u2014 but they\u2019re also immoral. And it\u2019ll be the mission of my presidency to bring them to an end. We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism. Because these are not only problems of economic inequality.\n\nThese are problems of racial inequality. And we have got to say that loudly and clearly.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t by any means intend to imply that we are not still making progress. We do have a lot to celebrate, as Congressman Rangel said. The people in this room know that \u2014 you have helped to make it happen.\n\nAnd there is no better example of that progression than our president. And for all the partisan resistance President Obama has faced every day, remember \u2014 and celebrate \u2014 he brought our economy back from the brink of another Great Depression. On his watch, 14 million jobs have been created, health care has been brought to 18 million people, the auto industry was saved, and so much else.\n\nNow, he would be the first to say \u2014 as we\u2019ve heard him say \u2014 that despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, America\u2019s long struggle with race is far from finished.\n\nFor many white Americans, it\u2019s tempting to believe that bigotry is largely behind us. That would leave us with a lot less work, wouldn\u2019t it? But more than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.\n\nNow anyone \u2014 anyone \u2014 asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with this reality. To see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be.\n\nI\u2019d be the first to admit I don\u2019t have all the answers. I\u2019ve made my own mistakes. I\u2019ve walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart we can and must do better. We\u2019ve made progress before, which gives me hope we can do it again. In the 1990s, economic programs like the new market tax credit, the earned income tax credit, and empowerment zones like the one right here in Harlem made a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nThey helped to create the highest increase in black incomes and the lowest black unemployment in history. We achieved record small-business lending to minority-owned businesses, and record bank lending in minority communities. Right here in Harlem, the unemployment rate dropped by two-thirds, and we saw a drop in child poverty and an increase in employment and income for single mothers, too.\n\nWe also learned about what doesn\u2019t work. Some of what we tried didn\u2019t resolve problems. Some ended up creating new ones, and caused disappointment, frustration, even anger. So as we face today\u2019s challenges, we have to bring all those lessons to bear.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line, as I see it: When we make direct strategic investments in communities that have been left behind, and when we guarantee justice and dignity to every American, then we really can make progress. Lasting progress. Progress that will catapult us into the future. We can reduce poverty. We can build ladders of opportunity.\n\nSo I\u2019m proposing a comprehensive new commitment to equity and opportunity for African American communities. That means a real plan to create jobs. If I\u2019m elected president, we will direct hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments to places like Harlem and rural South Carolina \u2014 including $20 billion aimed specifically at creating jobs for young people.\n\nThe unemployment rate among young African Americans is twice as high as for young white people. Now, we need to get young people working, developing their skills, unlocking the full extent of the contributions they can make to themselves, their families, and our country. We need to make sure we\u2019re not only creating good jobs, but connecting black communities to where the good jobs are.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got to be strategic about our investments in transit and infrastructure. And we need a real plan, including expanding access to capital to support black entrepreneurs \u2014 especially black women, who represent the fastest-growing segment of women-owned businesses in America. And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s finally ensure equal pay for equal work for women.\n\nThat would benefit women of color most of all, and would lift up an awful lot of families. And let\u2019s go even further. Let\u2019s follow Governor Cuomo\u2019s lead and raise the minimum wage to help people get out of poverty.\n\nNow we need to support African American homeownership, which has always been one of the surest ways for black families to build wealth. That\u2019s why I have a plan that would, among things, help African American families save for a down payment.\n\nWe need to make sure every family also has access to quality pre-school. And I applaud Mayor De Blasio for what he\u2019s achieved here in New York with his pre-K program.\n\nAnd please, help us reverse the dangerous slide towards re-segregation in our schools. Our schools are now more segregated than they were in 1968. That is appalling, and we\u2019ve got to fix it.\n\nWe also have to make sure everyone who wants to go to college can afford to. And everyone with student debt can have that debt refinanced, and take thousands of dollars off the burden that they are carrying!\n\nLet\u2019s give tax credits to businesses that actually invest in training and in apprenticeship programs to help young people who don\u2019t go for a two or four-year degree.\n\nAnd my plan gives special support to historically black colleges and universities.\n\nThe HBCUs have produced some of the finest leaders in our country. And it\u2019s not just who they graduated in the past, it\u2019s the work they\u2019re still doing today \u2014 often against great odds.\n\nAnd then finally, and so importantly, we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system.\n\nNot half measures, but a full commitment with real follow-through. Now, this is something we can talk about for hours. In fact, I gave my first speech of this campaign in April not far from here, and it was about reforming criminal justice. Because the inequities that persist in our justice system undermine our shared vision of what America can \u2014 and should \u2014 be.\n\nOur legal system is still, all too often, stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable. And we\u2019ve seen the toll it takes on families torn apart by excessive incarceration, and children growing up in homes shattered by prison and poverty.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to get back to that fundamental principle that everyone, in every community, benefits when there is respect for the law \u2014 and when everyone is respected by the law. That is the formula for building trust and cooperation, and we need to not only acknowledge but fix the crisis of mass incarceration.\n\nLet\u2019s finally, once and for all, eliminate the remaining disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine. Let\u2019s rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities by creating more opportunities for people to actually interact with one another, to build relationships.\n\nLet\u2019s the end the epidemic of African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody.\n\nNow I think you know \u2014 because I sure believe \u2014 there are many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, putting themselves on the line to save lives. So let\u2019s learn from those who are doing it right, and apply those lessons across the country.\n\nLet\u2019s make sure the Justice Department has the resources to hold departments \u2014 like Ferguson\u2019s \u2014 accountable when they do it wrong.\n\nAgain and again, something terrible happens \u2014 and no one is held accountable; the deeply troubling pattern, and we\u2019ve got to break it. We\u2019ve also got to do a much better job of helping people who have paid their debt to society find jobs and support when they get out.\n\nUp to 60 percent of prisoners who re-enter society face long-term unemployment. That\u2019s a recipe for hopelessness and repeat offending. My jobs plan would make significant investments in re-entry programs for the formerly incarcerated.\n\nIn my faith, we believe in second chances. In America, we believe in second chances. Let\u2019s give those chances to people who need our help the most. Let\u2019s give them a fair shot \u2014 which is also why I will \u201cban the box\u201d in the federal government. And I want to thank Attorney General Holder, who has been really in the forefront of making so many of these changes happen. And I also want to thank another great New Yorker, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who is continuing the work for equity and justice!\n\nAnd let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get to work to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. It\u2019s diverting too many African-American kids into the criminal justice system, instead of giving them the education they deserve.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a significant increase in police involvement in school discipline, especially in schools with majority-black students. We\u2019re seeing an over-reliance on suspensions and expulsions. I\u2019m sure many of us remember that horrifying video of the girl in South Carolina being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom by a school police officer.\n\nA classroom should be a safe place for our children. We shouldn\u2019t even have to say that, I don\u2019t think.\n\nSo today I\u2019m announcing my plan to end the school to prison pipeline. It includes major investments in school districts that reform their discipline practices. We want districts to know, if they do the right thing, we\u2019ll have their backs. And we will dramatically expand support for guidance counselors, school psychologists and social workers \u2014 so instead of just labeling kids problem students, they can actually help kids with their problems, and keep them in school!\n\nAnd for schools that refuse to reform and states that refuse to take this issue seriously, I want the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights to intervene, because this \u2014 this is not just an education issue, this is a civil rights issue and we cannot ignore it any longer.\n\nThe bottom line is this: We need to be sending our kids to college. We need a cradle-to-college pipeline, not sending them into court and into prison.\n\nThere\u2019s much more to do. If you go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, you can read our full agenda.\n\nSometimes people make fun of me because I actually tell you what I want to do as president. I actually give you plans about what I want to do. I kind of think it\u2019s my duty to help inform voters, so that you can make a good decision!\n\nBut I want to mention one more critical area: Protecting that most fundamental of rights \u2014 the right to vote. Across our country, Republican governors and legislatures are erecting one barrier after another that make it harder for black people to vote. It\u2019s a blast from the Jim Crow past, and we need to call it for what it is.\n\nAnd in the past few days the stakes got even higher. Justice Scalia\u2019s passing means the court hangs in the balance. Now the Republicans say they\u2019ll reject anyone President Obama nominates, no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn\u2019t have the right to nominate anyone, as if somehow he\u2019s not the real president.\n\nThat\u2019s in keeping with what we\u2019ve heard all along, isn\u2019t it? Many Republicans talk in coded, racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics \u2014 or our country.\n\nThe president has the right to nominate, under the Constitution, and the Senate has the obligation to process that nomination. And I hope the Senate will start paying more attention to statesmanship than partisanship. And I hope that they will understand that we can have our differences, but let\u2019s not go right after fundamental rules of how we govern ourselves. That\u2019s a bridge way too far, my friends.\n\nNow, I will appoint Supreme Court justices who will see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress, not as an excuse to try to roll back decisions going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt \u2014 which is apparently what some of them would prefer to do!\n\nNow I suppose some people will hear what I\u2019m proposing and think, \u201cWell, she\u2019s saying this because she\u2019s in an election.\u201d But many of you in this audience know me, and you know that these issues have always been part of my North Star.\n\nIn my first semester at law school, a woman named Marian Wright Edelman came to speak on campus at Yale. She was the first African American woman admitted to the Mississippi bar, a lawyer for the NAACP in Jackson, a friend of Dr. King before he was murdered \u2014 altogether a remarkable person. She talked about starting a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education on behalf of poor children who were invisible to the rest of the country.\n\nSomething clicked in my brain that day. Until I heard Marian speak, it wasn\u2019t clear to me how to channel my faith and commitment to social justice to try to make a real difference in the world. But she put me on the path of service.\n\nI went to work for her at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. She sent me to her home state of South Carolina to take on the problem of black teenagers who were being incarcerated along with adults. And when I look back, everything else I\u2019ve done \u2014 whether it was going undercover to Alabama to expose segregated academies and try to skip them of their tax exemptions, or running a legal clinic at the University of Arkansas, to represent inmates \u2014 that\u2019s been part of my mission. Representing poor people through the Legal Services Corporation: It\u2019s about making people\u2019s lives better.\n\nAnd it taught me that, even if you\u2019re young and you don\u2019t have a powerful job, if you work at it and you stick with it, you can make a difference.\n\n\u2026 You know, to quote Dr. King, the time is always right to do right \u2014 no matter who you are. And when I had the great privilege of representing New York, I worked with members of our congressional delegation. We fought to bring investments and jobs to neighborhoods that needed them, to improve health care, to get cleaner air and water for low-income communities.\n\nOne of the highlights was partnering with the organization, One Hundred Black Men, to create the Eagle Academy, which has been so successful \u2014 it\u2019s grown to six schools now in New York \u2014 taking young African American and Latino men.\n\nThere was always something to be done, and I had so many partners here in New York. We championed reforms to probation and drug diversion programs. We promoted specialized drug courts and juvenile programs, coming full circle with the work that I had done for Marion.\n\nSo when I decided to run for president, I knew these issues had to be at the heart of my campaign. That\u2019s where they\u2019ve always been, that\u2019s where they will always be.\n\nAnd I want to add something else: We Democrats have a special obligation: If we\u2019re serious about our commitment to the poor, to those who need some help, including African Americans, if we continue to ask black people to vote for us, we cannot minimize the realities of the lives they lead or take their concerns for granted.\n\nYou know, you can\u2019t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that\u2019s enough. We can\u2019t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote. We have to demonstrate a sustained commitment to building opportunity, creating prosperity, and righting wrongs. Not just every two or four years, not just when the cameras are on and people are watching, but every single day.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I ask of you: Hold me accountable. Hold every candidate accountable. What we say matters \u2014 but what we do matters more. And you deserve leaders who will do whatever it takes to tear down all the barriers holding you back, and then replace them with those ladders of opportunities that every American deserves to have.\n\nI\u2019m also asking all Americans to join in that effort. As Cornell Brooks, the new head of the NAACP, said in our meeting this morning: None of this is a \u201cthey\u201d problem. It\u2019s a \u201cwe\u201d problem, and all of us have to admit that. And you know what? It is not an urban problem. It\u2019s an American problem.\n\nEnding systemic racism requires contributions from all of us \u2014 especially those of us who haven\u2019t experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day.\n\nWe need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone\u2019s experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bare \u2014 and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems.\n\nAnd we all need to try as best we can to walk in one another\u2019s shoes. Imagine what it would be like to sit our son or daughter down and have the talk. Or if people followed us around stores or locked our car doors whenever we walked past.\n\nThat kind of empathy is critical. It\u2019s what makes it possible for people from every background, every race, every religion to come together in this great city, and to come together as one nation. It\u2019s what makes a country like America endure.\n\nYou know, I started my remarks by talking about Flint. I\u2019m going to keep talking about Flint until the families there get the help they need \u2014 for as long as it takes.\n\nBut there\u2019s another side to the story of this tragedy.\n\nIt\u2019s the story of hundreds of union plumbers from across the country travelling to Flint to install water filters for free.\n\nIt\u2019s students at universities all over the Midwest raising funds for water deliveries and student athletes showing up in Flint to distribute supplies.\n\nIt\u2019s the United Auto Workers and General Motors donating millions.\n\nIt\u2019s money pouring in to organizations where people are donating, if you wish, to try and help the kids and the people of Flint. And I\u2019m grateful to everyone who has responded to our request sent out to our campaign.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the story of that kindergartner in Wilton, NH who lost his first tooth just a few days ago. The tooth fairy left him five dollars. I got a dime, I don\u2019t know about you.\n\nAnd he said to his mother, \u201cI want to give it so those little kids can have water.\u201d His mom sat right down and wrote me a letter about it.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s the best of America, and it keeps me going. That sense we are all in this together. We all have vital contributions to make, and that when we come together \u2014 all of us \u2014 with a sense of shared purpose and shared humanity, we can solve any problem we face.\n\nAnd we can heal any divide. We can build a future that is far, far better than our past. That is my hope for our country, that is my goal for this election, and I promise to keep fighting right alongside all of you, every day, to make the United States a place where all men and all women are treated as equals \u2014 just as we are, just as we deserve to be.\n\nThat is my hope for America.\n\nThank you all very much.",

Trump, on the eve of accepting the Republican nomination for president, explicitly raised new questions on Wednesday about his commitment to automatically defending NATO allies if they are attacked, saying he would first look at their contributions to the alliance.\n\nAsked about Russia\u2019s threatening activities, which have unnerved the small Baltic States that are among the more recent entrants into NATO, Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have \u201cfulfilled their obligations to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they fulfill their obligations to us,\u201d he added, \u201cthe answer is yes.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement appeared to be the first time that a major candidate for president had suggested conditioning the United States\u2019 defense of its major allies. It was consistent, however, with his previous threat to withdraw American forces from Europe and Asia if those allies fail to pay more for American protection.\n\nMr. Trump also said he would not pressure Turkey or other authoritarian allies about conducting purges of their political adversaries or cracking down on civil liberties. The United States, he said, has to \u201cfix our own mess\u201d before trying to alter the behavior of other nations.",

    "text":"A transcript of an Oval Office interview Friday with President Donald Trump by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace. Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used.\n\nAP: I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.\n\nTRUMP: Good.\n\nAP: I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview.\n\nTRUMP: Did you see Aya (Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years) ...\n\nAP: Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?\n\nTRUMP: No, just \u2014 you know, I asked the government to let her out. ...\n\nTRUMP: You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.\n\nAP: How did you hear about this story?\n\nTRUMP: Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It\u2019s an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize \u2014 I mean, she was in a rough place.\n\nAP: Did you have to strike a deal with (Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah) el-Sissi over this?\n\nTRUMP: No. No deal. He was here. He \u2014 I said, \u201cI really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out.\u201d And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ...\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, it\u2019s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel.\n\n(Crosstalk) AP: Really?\n\nTRUMP: Chancellor Merkel.\n\nTRUMP: And I guess somebody shouted out, \u201cShake her hand, shake her hand,\u201d you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.\n\nAP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?\n\nTRUMP: No. Because, um, I\u2019m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I\u2019m at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. ...\n\nTRUMP: So it was a great thing to see that happen.\n\n___\n\nAP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?\n\nTRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, it\u2019s an artificial barrier. It\u2019s not very meaningful. I think I\u2019ve established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I\u2019m here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I\u2019ve established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ...\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody\u2019s written that. In fact, they said, \u201cOh, well, he\u2019s not treating them nicely,\u201d because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, \u201cCome on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.\u201d He\u2019ll pay.\n\nAP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting?\n\nTRUMP: He\u2019s going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it\u2019s a different kind of a presidency.\n\nAP: Do you feel like that\u2019s one thing that you\u2019ve changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,\u201d or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ...\n\nTRUMP: I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It\u2019s actually a little bit more than that, but it\u2019s $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life.\u201d We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut \u2014 same planes, same everything \u2014 was because of me. I mean, because that\u2019s what I do.\n\nTRUMP: Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those ... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, \u201cCould I thank you?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d He said, \u201cYou saved us $100 million.\u201d Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they (bought). Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that\u2019s a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of \u2014 it\u2019s between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.\n\nAP: And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?\n\nTRUMP: More. I\u2019m gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it\u2019s great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn (Hewson), she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?\n\n___\n\nAP: Do you feel like you\u2019ve been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?\n\nTRUMP: I have great relationships with Congress. I think we\u2019re doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We\u2019re going to be applying, I shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but we\u2019re going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019ve worked on it long and hard. And you\u2019ve got to understand, I\u2019ve only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I\u2019ve been here 92 days but I\u2019ve only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day(s), so I\u2019ve been working on health care for 60 days. ...You know, we\u2019re very close. And it\u2019s a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.\n\nAP: Is it this deal that\u2019s between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you\u2019re looking at?\n\nTRUMP: So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They\u2019re great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don\u2019t seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don\u2019t have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it\u2019s fine. But you know there\u2019s a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we\u2019ll be in great shape on that. It\u2019s going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.\n\nAP: That takes precedent over health care? For next week?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we\u2019ve done a lot. You have a list of things. I don\u2019t have to read it.\n\n___\n\nAP: You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?\n\nTRUMP: Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I\u2019m mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I\u2019ll talk to you ...\n\n(Crosstalk.)\n\nTRUMP: But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, \u201cBy the way, I\u2019d like you to solve the North Korean problem,\u201d doesn\u2019t work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it\u2019s a very exact thing. It\u2019s not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?\n\nAP: I\u2019m OK, thank you. No. ...\n\nTRUMP: But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there\u2019s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he\u2019s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, \u201cBy the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you\u2019re a currency manipulator.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don\u2019t get it, in which case they\u2019re very stupid people, or they just don\u2019t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t call them a currency manipulator.\u201d Well, for two reasons. Number One, he\u2019s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it\u2019s like generalities, it\u2019s not. They have \u2014 they\u2019ve actually \u2014 their currency\u2019s gone up. So it\u2019s a very, very specific formula. And I said, \u201cHow badly have they been,\u201d ... they said, \u201cSince you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.\u201d That\u2019s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that\u2019ll work out or maybe it won\u2019t. Can you imagine? ...\n\nAP: So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?\n\nTRUMP: No, because much of the foundation\u2019s been laid. Things came up. I\u2019ll give you an example. I didn\u2019t put Supreme Court judge on the 100 (day) plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.\n\nAP: I think it\u2019s on there.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. ...\n\nAP: \u201cBegin the process of selecting.\u201d You actually exceeded on this one. This says, \u201cBegin the process of selecting a replacement.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s the biggest thing I\u2019ve done.\n\nAP: Do you consider that your biggest success?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I \u2014 first of all I think he\u2019s a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don\u2019t forget, he could be there for 40 years. ... He\u2019s a young man. I\u2019ve always heard that that\u2019s the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I\u2019ve always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I\u2019ve done one in my first 70 days.\n\nTRUMP: Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. ...\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million \u2014 look at that, that\u2019s a massive amount of money. And I\u2019ll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes \u2014 Gen. (Jim) Mattis (the defense secretary) said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d because he had to sign the ultimate (unintelligible) ... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before, as long as I\u2019ve been in the military.\u201d You know, that kind of cutting.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: Now, if I can do that (unintelligible) ... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won\u2019t happen.\n\nAP: Is that something you\u2019re going to take on?\n\nTRUMP: (unintelligible) But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. ...\n\n___\n\nAP: Can I ask you, over your first 100 days \u2014 you\u2019re not quite there yet \u2014 how do you feel like the office has changed you?\n\nTRUMP: Well the one thing I would say \u2014 and I say this to people \u2014 I never realized how big it was. Everything\u2019s so (unintelligible) like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to \u2014\n\nAP: You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Number One, there\u2019s great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cYou know, this is more than just like, 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that\u2019s involved,\u201d because people could have been killed. This is risk that\u2019s involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area \u2014 you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away \u2014 and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you\u2019d normally make. (unintelligible) ... This is involving death and life and so many things. ... So it\u2019s far more responsibility. (unintelligible) ....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest \u2014 you know, you go down the list.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP. It\u2019s massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that\u2019s involved in some of the decisions.\n\n___\n\nAP: You\u2019ve talked a little bit about the way that you\u2019ve brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesn\u2019t translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?\n\nTRUMP: Well in business, you don\u2019t necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you\u2019re talking about health care \u2014 you have health care in business but you\u2019re trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You\u2019re providing health. This is (unintelligible). Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don\u2019t involve heart.\n\nAP: What\u2019s that switch been like for you?\n\nTRUMP: In fact, in business you\u2019re actually better off without it.\n\nAP: What\u2019s making that switch been like for you?\n\nTRUMP: You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we\u2019re going to be doing major tax reform. Here\u2019s part of your story, it\u2019s going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, he\u2019s delaying.\u201d I\u2019m not delaying anything. I\u2019ll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That\u2019s another thing that really has \u2014 I\u2019ve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, \u201cWell the one thing good is now I\u2019ll get good press.\u201d And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.\n\n___\n\nAP: But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?\n\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019m going to roll (out) probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we\u2019re putting out a massive tax reform \u2014 business and for people \u2014 we want to do both. We\u2019ve been working on it (unintelligible). Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful (unintelligible). ... We\u2019re going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case (unintelligible). ... And that\u2019s a big story, because a lot of people think I\u2019m going to put it out much later.\n\nAP: Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?\n\nTRUMP: Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had. ...\n\n___\n\nAP: Obviously, that\u2019s going to come in a week where you\u2019re going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it \u2014 you\u2019ve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it\u2019s funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I\u2019ve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college \u2014 but it\u2019s a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they\u2019re 73 percent down. ... That\u2019s a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it\u2019s going lower. Now, people aren\u2019t coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through, and there isn\u2019t crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of that\u2019s stopped because they can\u2019t get through.\n\nAP: It sounds like maybe you\u2019re beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn\u2019t have border funding in there, you would sign it.\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I\u2019m seeing. I\u2019m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.\n\nAP: What do you think the estimate on it would be?\n\nTRUMP: Oh I\u2019m seeing numbers \u2014 $24 billion, I think I\u2019ll do it for $10 billion or less. That\u2019s not a lot of money relative to what we\u2019re talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in \u2014 and we\u2019ll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall \u2014 they\u2019re coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can\u2019t do it because it\u2019s a real wall. That\u2019s a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We\u2019re becoming a drug culture, there\u2019s so much. And most of it\u2019s coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.\n\nAP: But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn\u2019t have \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want to comment. I just don\u2019t know yet. I mean, I have to see what\u2019s going on. I really do. But the wall\u2019s a very important thing to \u2014 not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn\u2019t, I mean I\u2019ll do things that aren\u2019t necessarily popular. ... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.\n\nAP: If you don\u2019t have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?\n\nTRUMP: My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall\u2019s getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it\u2019s getting built. And it\u2019s also getting built for much less money \u2014 I hope you get this \u2014 than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It\u2019s not going to cost anywhere near that.\n\nAP: You think $10 billion or less.\n\nTRUMP: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. And they\u2019re using those numbers; they\u2019re using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable (sic). And the fact it\u2019s going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.\n\n___\n\n(Off-the-record discussion.)\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: They had a quote from me that NATO\u2019s obsolete. But they didn\u2019t say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn\u2019t in government. People don\u2019t go around asking about NATO if I\u2019m building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO\u2019s obsolete \u2014 not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO \u2014 NATO is obsolete, and I said, \u201cAnd the reason it\u2019s obsolete is because of the fact they don\u2019t focus on terrorism.\u201d You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.\n\nAP: What specifically has NATO changed?\n\nTRUMP: (Cites Wall Street Journal article) ... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete \u2014 I said two things \u2014 obsolete, and the country\u2019s aren\u2019t paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn\u2019t believe. And then some expert on NATO said, \u201cYou know, Trump is right.\u201d But I said it was obsolete because they weren\u2019t focused on terror. ...\n\nIt\u2019s not fair that we\u2019re paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they\u2019re supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I\u2019m very strong on it and I\u2019m going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAP: This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.\n\nAP: Do you think it\u2019s going to help Marine Le Pen?\n\nTRUMP: I think so.\n\nAP: Do you believe that she should be the president?\n\nTRUMP: No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it\u2019ll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what\u2019s been going on in France.\n\nAP: Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to \u2014.\n\nTRUMP: No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing. ...\n\nAP: I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...\n\nTRUMP: No, I am no different than \u2014 no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we\u2019ve done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I\u2019m not going to have it in this country. I\u2019m not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it\u2019s already largely, you know \u2014 we have tens \u2014 we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn\u2019t be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It\u2019s a big mistake.\n\nAP: Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I am not endorsing her and I didn\u2019t mention her name.\n\nAP: Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.\n\nTRUMP: I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.\n\n___\n\nAP: I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though \u2014 I mean, the markets go up and down.\n\nTRUMP: You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I\u2019ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, \u201cOnly because of you am I making this massive investment.\u201d Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that.\n\n___\n\nAP: What about NAFTA? What\u2019s the plan on NAFTA?\n\nTRUMP: What would you like to know?\n\nAP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.\n\nTRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don\u2019t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.\n\nAP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?\n\nTRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.\n\nAP: Termination is still on the table.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. If they don\u2019t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.\n\nAP: What\u2019s a timeline for that decision?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it\u2019s a six-month clause.\n\n___\n\nAP: If I could fit a couple of more topics. Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority. You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?\n\nTRUMP: When Wikileaks came out ... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, \u201cWell, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.\u201d You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn\u2019t have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren\u2019t able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, \u201cWow.\u201d It was just a figure of speech. I said, \u201cWell, look at this. It\u2019s good reading.\u201d\n\nAP: But that didn\u2019t mean that you supported what Assange is doing?\n\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn\u2019t even allow the FBI. How about this \u2014 they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won\u2019t let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn\u2019t (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.\n\nAP: CrowdStrike?\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s what I heard. I heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that\u2019s what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn\u2019t they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It\u2019s incredible.\n\nAP: Can I just ask you, though \u2014 do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?\n\nTRUMP: I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it\u2019s OK with me. I didn\u2019t know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it\u2019s OK with me.\n\n___\n\nAP: On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign \u2014\n\nTRUMP: And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. ...\n\nAP: On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?\n\nTRUMP: In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.\n\nAP: So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?\n\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.\n\nAP: In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?\n\nTRUMP: In terms of what they are doing of all over.\n\nAP: When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t talk to them about it.\n\nAP: You don\u2019t talk to them about the Iran deal?\n\nTRUMP: I mention it, but it\u2019s very personal when I talk to them, you know, it\u2019s confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don\u2019t say that they are different than my opinions, but I\u2019d rather have you ask them that question.\n\nAP: At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s possible that we won\u2019t.\n\n___\n\nAP: Dreamers, you\u2019ve talked about them, you\u2019ve talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No, we aren\u2019t looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers ... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he\u2019s got some problems, it\u2019s a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They\u2019ve taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that\u2019s what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.\n\nAP: And that\u2019s going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. Yes. That\u2019s our policy. I am not saying ... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. (John) Kelly, now (Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being ... all over the country and nobody\u2019s ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that\u2019s probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth. ...\n\nAP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don\u2019t want to give them the wrong message with this.\n\nTRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I\u2019ll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy. ...\n\n___\n\n(An aide talks about the president\u2019s address to Congress.)\n\nTRUMP: A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.\n\nAP: You seem like you enjoyed it.\n\nTRUMP: I did. I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success? ... That\u2019s another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we\u2019ve had in the Middle East with the ISIS (an abbreviation for the Islamic State group)? When (current Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al) Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years. ... We have had tremendous success, but we don\u2019t talk about it. We don\u2019t talk about it.\n\nAP: Do you mean you don\u2019t talk about it personally because you don\u2019t want to talk about it?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t talk about it. No. And the generals don\u2019t talk about it.\n\n___\n\nAP: You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days. I know they have sent that over. Have you accepted a plan? Are you moving forward on a strategy?\n\nTRUMP: We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.\n\nAP: So you have decided on a plan?\n\nTRUMP: Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP. Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.\n\nAP: Can you say generally what the strategy is? Should people \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations.\n\nAP: Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?\n\nTRUMP: No, not much.\n\nAP: In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Well, they\u2019ve also accepted my strategy.\n\nAP: Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?\n\nTRUMP: Not many.\n\nAP: So a small increase?\n\nTRUMP: It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more. ... This is an important story. I\u2019ve done a lot. I\u2019ve done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I\u2019m scheduled ... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ...\n\nAP: What do you think it was about your chemistry?\n\nTRUMP: We had good chemistry. Now I don\u2019t know that I think that\u2019s going to produce results but you\u2019ve got a good chance.\n\nAP: Uh-huh.\n\nTRUMP: Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They\u2019re coming into China and they\u2019re being turned away. That\u2019s never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they\u2019ve never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There\u2019s a great foundation that\u2019s built. Great foundation. And I think it\u2019s going to produce tremendous results for our country.\n\n___\n\nAP: One more 100 days question.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s fine.\n\nAP: ... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn\u2019t been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.\n\nAP: Do you mean your White House team when you say that?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince (Priebus) has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It\u2019s just the registration, there\u2019s nothing you can do. So you\u2019re losing the two biggest states, that\u2019s where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it\u2019s very, very hard. Look at Obama\u2019s number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were ... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions ... Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn\u2019t 270, it was 306. So there\u2019s anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it\u2019s not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here\u2019s a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes.\n\nAP: Three Democratic votes, but yeah.\n\nTRUMP: Three Democratic votes. OK. He\u2019s an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all ... nothing. He\u2019s like a ...\n\nAP: Do you think that you can break through that? I mean this \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, I do.\n\nAP: Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.\n\nTRUMP: I think (I) can to an extent. But there\u2019s a, there\u2019s a basic hard-line core that you can\u2019t break though, OK, that you can\u2019t break through. There\u2019s a hard-line group you can\u2019t break through, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s sad. You can\u2019t. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings (of Maryland). I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.\n\nAP: He disputed that slightly.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s what he said. I mean, what can I tell you?\n\nAP: Yeah.\n\nTRUMP: There\u2019s six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?\n\nAP: He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Well he said, you\u2019ll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I\u2019ll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It\u2019s incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it\u2019s like he was never in my office. And you can even say that.\n\n___\n\nAP: And that\u2019s one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it\u2019s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No I have, it\u2019s interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it\u2019s the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.\n\nAP: I remember, right.\n\nTRUMP: It had 9.2 million people. It\u2019s the highest they\u2019ve ever had. On any, on air, (CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It\u2019s the highest for \u201cFace the Nation\u201d or as I call it, \u201cDeface the Nation.\u201d It\u2019s the highest for \u201cDeface the Nation\u201d since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It\u2019s a tremendous advantage.\n\nI have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that\u2019s what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you\u2019re fake, but \u2014 but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It\u2019s not that Fox treats me well, it\u2019s that Fox is the most accurate.\n\nAP: Do you believe that? That Fox \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it\u2019s a terrorism ... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, \u201cHe called it a terrorist attack.\u201d They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I\u2019m 10-0 for that. I\u2019ve called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I\u2019m ... Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I\u2019m here and they\u2019re not.\n\n___\n\nAP: Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there\u2019s such real-time reaction with everything you say?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nAP: Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?\n\nTRUMP: The one thing \u2014\n\nAP: That you have to do \u2014\n\nTRUMP: OK. The one thing I\u2019ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don\u2019t watch CNN anymore.\n\nAP: You just said you did.\n\nTRUMP: No. No, I, if I\u2019m passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)?\n\nAP: You just said \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Where? Where?\n\nAP: Two minutes ago.\n\nTRUMP: No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what\u2019d I say, I stopped watching them. But I don\u2019t watch CNN anymore. I don\u2019t watch MSNBC. I don\u2019t watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what\u2019s going on.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch (MSNBC\u2019s) \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d I don\u2019t watch \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it\u2019s about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it\u2019s such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I\u2019ve developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don\u2019t watch things that are unpleasant. I just don\u2019t watch them.\n\nAP: And do you feel like that\u2019s, that\u2019s because of the office that you now occupy \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No.\n\nAP: That you\u2019ve made that change?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know why it is, but I\u2019ve developed that ability, and it\u2019s happened over the last, over the last year.\n\nAP: That\u2019s interesting.\n\nTRUMP: And I don\u2019t watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don\u2019t watch them anymore. A lot of people don\u2019t watch them anymore, they\u2019re now in third place. But I\u2019ve created something where people are watching ... but I don\u2019t watch CNN anymore. I don\u2019t watch MSNBC anymore. I don\u2019t watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I\u2019d watch.\n\nAP: Sure.\n\nTRUMP: I just don\u2019t. And that\u2019s taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that\u2019s a great, it\u2019s a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you\u2019re, you don\u2019t watch this total negativity. I never thought I\u2019d be able to do that and for me, it\u2019s so easy to do now. Just don\u2019t watch.\n\nAP: That\u2019s interesting.\n\nTRUMP: Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t know.",

    "text":"I came to Washington to fight for a smaller government and get spending under control, not shut the government down. In fact, I have repeatedly voted to fund the government in the last few days.\n\nThe shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.\n\nUnfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge.\n\nI want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is.\n\nShutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding \u2014 it doesn't even touch mandatory funding.\n\nSince its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare.\n\nObamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.\n\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.

    "text":"As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.\n\n\"One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,\" CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O\u2019Malley group.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,\" said the attack, which first aired June 25. \"Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (\"Bernie Sanders, gun nut\") as well as conservative glee (\"Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut\"). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.\n\nThe Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)\n\nBut before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:\n\n\u2022 In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.\n\n\u2022 The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn\u2019t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.\n\n\u2022 After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn\u2019t exist at the time).\n\n\u2022 He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.\n\n\u2022 The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.\n\nAccording to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.\n\n\"He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,\" Weaver said. \"He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.\"\n\nIn April 1991, Sanders\u2019 then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.\n\n\"Bernie\u2019s response is that he doesn\u2019t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,\" Pollina said. \"It\u2019s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.\"\n\nThe Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders\u2019 own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.\n\n\"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,\" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents\u2019 preferences so does not make gun control a priority.\"\n\n\"I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line \u2013 and angering both sides through the years,\" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. \"Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.\"\n\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders\u2019 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.\n\nHere are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):\n\nSanders\u2019 moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn\u2019t consider Sanders \"an anti-gunner,\" and he\u2019s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn\u2019t a \"gun lobby lapdog.\"\n\nExperts agreed that on guns, Sanders\u2019 views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.\n\n\"When it comes to guns, he\u2019s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O\u2019Malley or Hillary Clinton,\" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. \"Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don\u2019t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn attack ad said, \"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\nThe Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.\n\nExperts noted Sanders\u2019 votes were representative of Vermont\u2019s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.\n\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly True.",

    "text":"Rose Garden\n\n11:27 A.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everybody. Lately, I\u2019ve been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy -- a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy.\n\nThis strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; it\u2019s also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. It\u2019s the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, it\u2019s the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that we\u2019ve put up [with] every single year -- the same kind of increase that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of months.\n\nObviously rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether you\u2019re trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, it\u2019s like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and made sure it extended all the way through this year, so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now.\n\nBut I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they don\u2019t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We\u2019ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.\n\nBut as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil and we only have 2 percent of the world\u2019s proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, we\u2019d still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time there\u2019s instability in the Middle East, or growing demand in countries like China and India.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now. It\u2019s those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long-term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil.\n\nThat includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few aren\u2019t able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage, and driving prices higher -- only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We can\u2019t afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. That\u2019s not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody else\u2019s expense.\n\nNow, the good news is my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows.\n\nWe closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said for the first time that federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So I\u2019d point out that anybody who\u2019s pledging to roll back Wall Street reform -- Dodd-Frank -- would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it.\n\nI\u2019ve asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump.\n\nSo today, we\u2019re announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific.\n\nFirst, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers aren\u2019t hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly.\n\nChairman Gensler actually had a good analogy. He said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams but didn\u2019t increase the number of refs. You\u2019d end up having havoc on the field, and it would diminish the game. It wouldn\u2019t be fair. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement.\n\nSecond, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold, and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs.\n\nThird, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades.\n\nCongress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their members of Congress to step up.\n\nIn the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform.\n\nLet me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels; we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars; we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy.\n\nAnd these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign -- our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office -- even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable.\n\nWe've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future -- America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND\n\n11:35 A.M. EDT",

    "text":"1:21 P.M. MDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, El Paso! (Applause.) Well, it is wonderful -- wonderful to be back with all of you in the Lone Star State. (Applause.) Everything is bigger in Texas. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you back! (Applause.) Even the welcomes are bigger. (Applause.) So, in appreciation, I wanted to give a big policy speech outside on a really hot day. (Laughter.) Those of you who are still wearing your jackets, feel free to take them off. I hope everybody is wearing sunscreen.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We live here.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You say you live here? You don\u2019t need it, huh? (Laughter.) Well, it is a great honor to be here. And I want to express my appreciation to all of you for taking the time to come out today.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nYou know, about a week ago, I delivered a commencement address at Miami Dade Community College, which is one of the most diverse schools in the nation. The graduates were proud that their class could claim heritage from 181 countries around the world -- 181 countries. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nMany of the students were immigrants themselves, coming to America with little more than the dream of their parents and the clothes on their back. A handful had discovered only in adolescence or adulthood that they were undocumented. But they worked hard and they gave it their all, and so they earned those diplomas.\n\n\n\nAnd at the ceremony, 181 flags -- one for every nation that was represented -- was marched across the stage. And each one was applauded by the graduates and the relatives with ties to those countries. So when the Haitian flag went by, all the Haitian kids -- Haitian American kids shouted out. And when the Guatemalan flag went by, all the kids of Guatemalan heritage shouted out. And when the Ukrainian flag went by, I think one kid shouted out. (Laughter.) This was down in Miami. (Laughter.) If it had been in Chicago, there would have been more.\n\n\n\nBut then, the last flag, the American flag, came into view. And everyone in the room erupted in applause. Everybody cheered. (Applause.) So, yes, their parents and grandparents -- some of the graduates themselves -- had come from every corner of the globe. But it was here that they had found opportunity. It was here that they had a chance to contribute to the nation that is their home.\n\n\n\nAnd it was a reminder of a simple idea, as old as America itself: E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace America\u2019s ideals and America\u2019s precepts. That\u2019s why millions of people, ancestors to most of us, braved hardship and great risk to come here -- so they could be free to work and worship and start a business and live their lives in peace and prosperity. The Asian immigrants who made their way to California\u2019s Angel Island. The German and Scandinavians who settled across the Midwest. The waves of Irish, and Italian, and Polish, and Russian, and Jewish immigrants who leaned against the railing to catch their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty.\n\n\n\nThis flow of immigrants has helped make this country stronger and more prosperous. (Applause.) We can point to the genius of Einstein, the designs of I. M. Pei, the stories of Isaac Asimov, the entire industries that were forged by Andrew Carnegie.\n\n\n\nAnd then when I think about immigration I think about the naturalization ceremonies that we\u2019ve held at the White House for members of our military. Nothing could be more inspiring. Even though they were not yet citizens when they joined our military, these men and women signed up to serve.\n\n\n\nWe did one event at the White House and a young man named Granger Michael from Papua New Guinea, a Marine who had been deployed to Iraq three times, was there. And you know what he said about becoming an American citizen? He said, \u201cI might as well. I love this country already.\u201d That\u2019s all he said. Marines aren\u2019t big on speeches. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nAnother was a woman named Perla Ramos who was born and raised in Mexico and came to the United States shortly after 9\/11, and joined the Navy. And she said, \u201cI take pride in our flag and the history we write day by day.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the promise of this country -- that anyone can write the next chapter in our story. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from -- (applause) -- it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from; it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like; it doesn\u2019t matter what faith you worship. What matters is that you believe in the ideals on which we were founded; that you believe that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. (Applause.) All of us deserve our freedoms and our pursuit of happiness. In embracing America, you can become American. That is what makes this country great. That enriches all of us.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, we\u2019re here at the border today -- (applause) -- we\u2019re here at the border because we also recognize that being a nation of laws goes hand in hand with being a nation of immigrants. This, too, is our heritage. This, too, is important. And the truth is, we\u2019ve often wrestled with the politics of who is and who isn\u2019t allowed to come into this country. This debate is not new.\n\n\n\nAt times, there has been fear and resentment directed towards newcomers, especially in hard economic times. And because these issues touch deeply on what we believe, touch deeply on our convictions -- about who we are as a people, about what it means to be an American -- these debates often elicit strong emotions.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one reason it\u2019s been so difficult to reform our broken immigration system. When an issue is this complex, when it raises such strong feelings, it\u2019s easier for politicians to defer until the problem the next election. And there\u2019s always a next election.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve seen a lot of blame and a lot of politics and a lot of ugly rhetoric around immigration. And we\u2019ve seen good faith efforts from leaders of both parties -- by the way, I just noticed, those of you who have chairs, if you want to sit down, feel free. There\u2019s no rule about having to stand when I\u2019m --\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: -- we love you! (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But we\u2019ve seen leaders of both parties who try to work on this issue, but then their efforts fell prey to the usual Washington games. And all the while, we\u2019ve seen the mounting consequences of decades of inaction.\n\n\n\nToday, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants here in the United States. Some crossed the border illegally. Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas. Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBut we have to acknowledge they\u2019ve broken the rules. They\u2019ve cut in front of the line. And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.\n\n\n\nAlso, because undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, where they\u2019re vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses that skirt taxes, and pay workers less than the minimum wage, or cut corners with health and safety laws, this puts companies who follow the rules, and Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime or just a safe place to work, it puts those businesses at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\nThink about it. Over the past decade, even before the recession hit, middle-class families were struggling to get by as the costs went up for everything, from health care, to college tuition, to groceries, to gas. Their incomes didn\u2019t go up with those prices. We\u2019re seeing it again right now with gas prices.\n\n\n\nSo one way to strengthen the middle class in America is to reform the immigration system so that there is no longer a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor while depressing wages for everybody else. I want incomes for middle-class families to rise again. (Applause.) I want prosperity in this country to be widely shared. (Applause.) I want everybody to be able to reach that American dream. And that\u2019s why immigration reform is an economic imperative. It\u2019s an economic imperative. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd reform will also help to make America more competitive in the global economy. Today, we provide students from around the world with visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBut then our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or a new industry here in the United States. Instead of training entrepreneurs to stay here, we train them to create jobs for our competition. That makes no sense. In a global marketplace, we need all the talent we can attract, all the talent we can get to stay here to start businesses -- not just to benefit those individuals, but because their contribution will benefit all Americans.\n\n\n\nLook at Intel, look at Google, look at Yahoo, look at eBay. All those great American companies, all the jobs they\u2019ve created, everything that has helped us take leadership in the high-tech industry, every one of those was founded by, guess who, an immigrant. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo we don\u2019t want the next Intel or the next Google to be created in China or India. We want those companies and jobs to take root here. (Applause.) Bill Gates gets this. He knows a little something about the high-tech industry. He said, \u201cThe United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo immigration is not just the right thing to do. It\u2019s smart for our economy. It\u2019s smart for our economy. (Applause.) And it\u2019s for this reason that businesses all across America are demanding that Washington finally meet its responsibilities to solve the immigration problem. Everybody recognizes the system is broken. The question is, will we finally summon the political will to do something about it? And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here at the border today.\n\n\n\nAnd I want to say I am joined today by an outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who\u2019s been working tirelessly on this issue. (Applause.) Our commissioner who\u2019s working diligently on border issues, Alan Bersin, is there, and we appreciate him -- Bersin. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo they\u2019re doing outstanding work. And in recent years, among one of the greatest impediments to reform were questions about border security. And these were legitimate concerns. What was true was a lack of manpower and a lack of resources at the border, combined with the pull of jobs and ill-considered enforcement once folks were in the country.\n\n\n\nAll this contributed to a growing number of undocumented people living in the United States. And these concerns helped unravel a bipartisan coalition that we had forged back when I was in the United States Senate. So in the years since, \u201cborders first, borders first,\u201d that's become the common refrain, even among those who were previously supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\n\nBut over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet and Alan and everybody who\u2019s down here working at the border, we\u2019ve answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThe Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. It\u2019s a build-up that began under President Bush and that we\u2019ve continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here.\n\n\n\nThen they wanted a fence. Well, the fence is --\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The fence is now basically complete.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Tear it down!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Then we\u2019ve gone further. We tripled the number of intelligence analysts working at the border. I\u2019ve deployed unmanned aerial vehicles to patrol the skies from Texas to California. We have forged a partnership with Mexico to fight the transnational criminal organizations that have affected both of our countries. (Applause.) And for the first time -- for the first time we\u2019re screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south even as we go after drugs that are coming north. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo, here\u2019s the point. I want everybody to listen carefully to this. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we\u2019ve done. But even though we\u2019ve answered these concerns, I\u2019ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: They\u2019re racist!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they\u2019re going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they\u2019ll want a higher fence. Maybe they\u2019ll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They\u2019ll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That\u2019s politics.\n\n\n\nBut the truth is the measures we\u2019ve put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we\u2019ve seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally.\n\n\n\nAnd also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn\u2019t accept any violence or crime. And we\u2019ve always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it\u2019s not getting reported on.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going beyond the border. Beyond the border, we\u2019re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law. (Applause.) And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that\u2019s a tough issue. It\u2019s a source of controversy.\n\n\n\nBut I want to emphasize we\u2019re not doing it haphazardly. We\u2019re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we\u2019ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to ignore the real human toll of a broken immigration system. Even as we recognize that enforcing the law is necessary, we don\u2019t relish the pain that it causes in the lives of people who are just trying to get by and get caught up in the system.\n\n\n\nAnd as long as the current laws are on the books, it\u2019s not just hardened felons who are subject to removal, but sometimes families who are just trying to earn a living, or bright, eager students, or decent people with the best of intentions. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that\u2019s not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what I\u2019m committed to doing. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, we can. We can do it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The most significant step we can now take to secure the borders is to fix the system as a whole so that fewer people have the incentive to enter illegally in search of work in the first place. This would allow agents to focus on the worst threats on both of our -- both sides of our borders, from drug traffickers to those who would come here to commit acts of violence or terror. That\u2019s where our focus should be.\n\n\n\nSo, El Paso, the question is whether those in Congress who previously walked away in the name of enforcement are now ready to come back to the table and finish the work that we\u2019ve started. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to put the politics aside. And if we do, I\u2019m confident we can find common ground.\n\n\n\nWashington is lagging behind the country on this. There is already a growing coalition of leaders across America who don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye, but are coming together on this issue. They see the harmful consequences of a broken immigration system for their businesses and for their communities, and they understand why we need to act.\n\n\n\nThere are Democrats and Republicans, people like former Republican Senator Mel Martinez; former Bush administration Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; leaders like Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; evangelical ministers like Leith Anderson and Bill Hybels; police chiefs from across the nation; educators; advocates; labor unions; chambers of commerce; small business owners; Fortune 500 CEOs.\n\n\n\nI mean, one CEO had this to say about reform: \u201cAmerican ingenuity is a product of the openness and diversity of this society. Immigrants have made America great as the world leader in business, in science, higher education and innovation.\u201d You know who that leader was? Rupert Murdoch, who owns FOX News, and is an immigrant himself. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s views, but let\u2019s just say he doesn\u2019t have an Obama sticker on his car. (Laughter.) But he agrees with me on this. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo there is a consensus around fixing what\u2019s broken. And now we need Congress to catch up. Now we need to come together around reform that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; reform that demands that everybody take responsibility. So what would comprehensive reform look like?\n\n\n\nFirst, we know that government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders and enforce the law. And that\u2019s what Janet and all her folks are doing. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSecond, businesses have to be held accountable if they exploit undocumented workers. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThird, those who are here illegally, they have a responsibility as well. So they broke the law, and that means they\u2019ve got to pay their taxes, they\u2019ve got to pay a fine, they\u2019ve got to learn English. And they\u2019ve got to undergo background checks and a lengthy process before they get in line for legalization. That\u2019s not too much to ask. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd fourth, stopping illegal immigration also depends on reforming our outdated system of legal immigration. (Applause.) We should make it easier for the best and the brightest to not only stay here, but also to start businesses and create jobs here. In recent years, a full 25 percent of high-tech startups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. That led to 200,000 jobs here in America. I\u2019m glad those jobs are here. I want to see more of them created in this country. We need to provide them the chance. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe need to provide our farms a legal way to hire workers that they rely on, and a path for those workers to earn legal status. (Applause.) And our laws should respect families following the rules -- reuniting them more quickly instead of splitting them apart. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nToday, the immigration system not only tolerates those who break the rules, but it punishes folks who follow the rules. While applications -- while applicants wait for approval, for example, they\u2019re often forbidden from visiting the United States. Even husbands and wives may have to spend years apart. Parents can\u2019t see their children. I don\u2019t believe the United States of America should be in the business of separating families. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not who we are. We can do better than that. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. (Applause.) We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education or serve in the military. And that\u2019s why we need to pass the DREAM Act. (Applause.) Now, we passed the DREAM Act through the House last year when Democrats were in control. But even though it received a majority of votes in the Senate, it was blocked when several Republicans who had previously supported the DREAM Act voted no.\n\n\n\nThat was a tremendous disappointment to get so close and then see politics get in the way. And as I gave that commencement at Miami Dade, it broke my heart knowing that a number of those promising, bright students -- young people who worked so hard and who speak about what\u2019s best in America -- are at risk of facing the agony of deportation. These are kids who grew up in this country. They love this country. They know no other place to call home. The idea that we\u2019d punish them is cruel. It makes no sense. We\u2019re a better nation than that. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019re going to keep fighting for the DREAM Act. We\u2019re going to keep up the fight for reform. (Applause.) And that\u2019s where you come in. I\u2019m going to do my part to lead a constructive and civil debate on these issues. And we\u2019ve already had a series of meetings about this at the White House in recent weeks. We\u2019ve got leaders here and around the country helping to move the debate forward.\n\n\n\nBut this change ultimately has to be driven by you, the American people. You\u2019ve got to help push for comprehensive reform, and you\u2019ve got to identify what steps we can take right now -- like the DREAM Act, like visa reform -- areas where we can find common ground among Democrats and Republicans and begin to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m asking you to add your voices to this debate. You can sign up to help at whitehouse.gov. We need Washington to know that there is a movement for reform that\u2019s gathering strength from coast to coast. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll get this done. That\u2019s how we can ensure that in the years ahead we are welcoming the talents of all who can contribute to this country and that we\u2019re living up to the basic American idea that you can make it here if you try. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the idea that gave hope to Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez. Is Jos\u00e9 here? Where\u2019s -- Jos\u00e9 is right over there. (Applause.) I want you to hear -- I want you to think about this story. Jos\u00e9\u2019s parents were migrant farm workers. And so, growing up, he was too. He was born in California, though he could have just as easily been born on the other side of the border, if it had been a different time of year, because his family moved around with the seasons. So two of his siblings were actually born in Mexico.\n\n\n\nSo they traveled a lot, and Jos\u00e9 joined his parents picking cucumbers and strawberries. And he missed part of school when they returned to Mexico each winter. Jos\u00e9 didn\u2019t learn English until he was 12 years old. But you know what, Jos\u00e9 was good at math and he liked math. And the nice thing is that math was the same in every school, and it\u2019s the same in Spanish as it is in English.\n\n\n\nSo Jos\u00e9 studied, and he studied hard. And one day, he\u2019s standing in the fields, collecting sugar beets, and he heard on a transistor radio that a man named Franklin Chang-Diaz -- a man with a surname like his -- was going to be an astronaut for NASA. So Jos\u00e9 decided -- right there in the field, he decided -- well, I could be an astronaut, too.\n\n\n\nSo Jos\u00e9 kept on studying, and he graduated high school. And he kept on studying, and he earned an engineering degree. And he kept on studying, and he earned a graduate degree. And he kept on working hard, and he ended up at a national laboratory, helping to develop a new kind of digital medical imaging system.\n\n\n\nAnd a few years later, he found himself more than 100 miles above the surface of the Earth, staring out of the window of the shuttle Discovery, and he was remembering the boy in the California fields with that crazy dream that in America everything is possible. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThink about that, El Paso. That\u2019s the American Dream right there. (Applause.) That's what we\u2019re fighting for. We are fighting for every boy and every girl like Jos\u00e9 with a dream and potential that's just waiting to be tapped. We are fighting to unlock that promise, and all that holds not just for their futures, but for America\u2019s future. That's why we\u2019re going to get this done. And that's why I\u2019m going to need your help.\n\n\n\nThank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n1:56 P.M. MDT",

It is --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Obama!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you back. It is good to be here. (Applause.)\n\nI want to say thank you to the Thunder for hosting us here today. (Applause.) Well, we are so glad to be here. I want you to give it up for somebody who\u2019s been fighting for homeowners and working families every single day, who\u2019s with me today -- Secretary Shaun Donovan, Secretary of HUD. There he is right there. Give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got Congressman Ed Pastor who\u2019s here as well. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got your Mayor, Greg Stanton, here. (Applause.) Doing an outstanding job. And to all the mayors and state legislators and tribal leaders who are here today, thank you. (Applause.)\n\nGive Jorge a big round of applause for his introduction. (Applause.) To your superintendent, Dr. Kenneth Baca. (Applause.) Your principal, Dr. Anna Battle. (Applause.) And I appreciate everybody at Desert Vista for having me here today. (Applause.) It is good to see the students are pretty enthusiastic about being back in school. (Laughter.) I\u2019m not sure I would have been that enthusiastic starting on the 6th. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd I know this isn\u2019t your typical school -- second day of school. So I want to give a special shout-out to the new seniors, class of 2014. (Applause.) You are aware that you\u2019re not finished yet. (Laughter.) Senior year, that\u2019s sometimes tempting. I want you all to stay focused.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, I have been --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Happy birthday, Mr. President!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) It was my birthday two days ago. (Laughter.) Got some singers here.\n\nAUDIENCE: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Mr. President. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) I am now 52, and Michelle says that I don\u2019t look a day over 51. (Laughter.)\n\nSo over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class -- a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.\n\nAnd I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past four and a half years, together, we fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle-class security that had been taking place for decades.\n\nBut we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a tax code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. (Applause.) We saved the auto industry. We\u2019ve now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure we\u2019re building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nOur businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So we\u2019re making progress. (Applause.)\n\nSo thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, we\u2019ve cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. We\u2019re starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle-class family will tell you, we\u2019re not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.\n\nAnd reversing this trend should be -- must be -- Washington\u2019s highest priority. It\u2019s my highest priority. (Applause.) I want to make sure that in America, it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love -- you should be able to make it when you try. You should be able to make it. (Applause.)\n\nNow, unfortunately, for the last year or so, we\u2019ve had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle-class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care that\u2019s there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich; the opportunity -- the ladders of opportunity for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises.\n\nNow, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle-class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle-class life -- and that's the chance to own your own home. (Applause.) The chance to own your own home.\n\nWe've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded.\n\nI think about my grandparents\u2019 generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's Army -- when he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place where you could build up savings for college, or to start a business, or to retire with some security.\n\nAnd buying a home required responsibility on everybody\u2019s part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses weren\u2019t for flipping around, they weren\u2019t for speculation -- houses were to live in, and to build a life with.\n\nAnd unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldn\u2019t afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldn\u2019t afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst -- triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted.\n\nBy the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of Ground Zero for the housing bubble bursting.\n\nSo less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is it's been a long, slow process. The housing market is so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.\n\nWhere Congress wouldn\u2019t act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.)\n\nWe worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families -- largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called \u201cliar\u2019s loan.\u201d Now, something that's called a liar's loan is probably a bad idea. (Laughter.)\n\nSo because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air -- they\u2019re no longer underwater on their mortgages. (Applause.)\n\nAnd just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. (Applause.) So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent.\n\nThis morning, right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction -- (applause.) We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people -- and they\u2019re hiring even more people -- (applause) -- because the housing market is bouncing back.\n\nSo that's one of the things about housing. It's not just important for the person who owns the house; our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers, all these folks are impacted by the housing industry.\n\nSo we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hardworking Americans the chance to buy their first home. (Applause.) We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. (Applause.) We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what we\u2019ve got to do. (Applause.)\n\nSo I\u2019ve already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help accomplish that. And, look, the fact of the matter is Congress hasn\u2019t enacted all of them, so I\u2019d like you to encourage members of Congress to take some of these actions. (Applause.)\n\nBut like the other actions that we\u2019ve taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldn\u2019t afford, and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck.\n\nWhat we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle-class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hardworking Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them.\n\nNumber one: Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today\u2019s rates. (Applause.) We need to get that done. We\u2019ve been talking about it for a year and a half, two years, three years. There\u2019s no reason not to do it. (Applause.)\n\nStep number two: Now that we\u2019ve made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they can\u2019t afford, let\u2019s make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. (Applause.) So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure we\u2019re simplifying overlapping regulations; we\u2019re cutting red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if they\u2019ve worked hard to repair their credit.\n\nAnd step three is something that you don\u2019t always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. (Applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. It\u2019s got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. (Applause.) This could help homeownership here.\n\nSo I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. Let\u2019s go ahead and get this done.\n\nStep number four: We should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. Let\u2019s put construction back -- construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. (Applause.) Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their country\u2019s help to get back on their feet.\n\nStep five: We should make sure families that don\u2019t want to buy a home or can\u2019t yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. (Applause.) It\u2019s important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and there\u2019s nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties.\n\nIn the run-up to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren\u2019t ready and didn't have the payments. That\u2019s a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, let\u2019s invest in affordable rental housing. Let\u2019s bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. (Applause.)\n\nSo if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy -- all these steps will give more middle-class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who aren\u2019t yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy.\n\nBut -- and this is the last key point I want to make -- as home prices rise, we can\u2019t just re-inflate another housing bubble. I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. (Applause.)\n\nAnd one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really government, but not really private sector -- they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was \u201cheads we win, tails you lose.\u201d And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street.\n\nSo the good news is, right now there\u2019s a bipartisan group of senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like.\n\nFirst, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist -- I think I saw some posters there on the way in. (Laughter.) But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1st, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. (Applause.)\n\nBut in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle.\n\nA second principle is we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (Applause.) We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well -- well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. (Applause.)\n\nThe third principle is we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That\u2019s something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. (Applause.)\n\nNumber four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time homebuyers -- like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives today\u2019s families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.\n\nAnd we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And, by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. (Applause.) The Mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. (Applause.)\n\nSince I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way to US Airways, you\u2019re on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. (Applause.)\n\nBut we've got to keep going, because nobody in America, and certainly no veteran, should be left to live on the streets. (Applause.)\n\nSo here's the bottom line: Put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the state and throughout the country.\n\nWe're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. (Applause.) And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when they\u2019re shopping for a mortgage. They\u2019re designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English, so you can actually read it without a lawyer -- (applause) -- although, you may still want a lawyer obviously. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. (Laughter.) There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nAnd the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this -- head watchdog for the CFPB. (Applause.) So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners.\n\nWhen it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our nation\u2019s top housing regulator. He is an outstanding member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee -- worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up or down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. (Applause.)\n\nSo I want to be honest with you. No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multi-trillion dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high, the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. We\u2019ll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation -- a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. (Applause.)\n\nAnd if we stay focused on middle-class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy -- for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity -- then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle-class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the child\u2019s height on the door of their new home -- with pencil, of course. (Laughter.)\n\nWe can do all this if we work together. And it won\u2019t be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps -- and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship -- (applause) -- actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\nAnd as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you.

    "text":"May 23, 2010 \u2014 -- TAPPER: Hello again. Joining me now, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tim Kaine, and the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele. Gentlemen, welcome.\n\nKAINE: Hey, Jake, good to be with you.\n\nSTEELE: Jake, good to see you.\n\nTAPPER: I want to get to the general election results in a second, but first, I want to bear in on a couple of controversies we have, and I'm going to start with you, Mr. Steele.\n\nSTEELE: OK.\n\nTAPPER: I don't know if you were expecting (ph) that or not--\n\nSTEELE: Kind of.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTAPPER: The Kentucky Senate candidate, Rand Paul, has expressed his objections philosophically to the federal government being able to tell businesses that they cannot discriminate. Here's Rand Paul.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRAND PAUL, SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, R-KY.: I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains. I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.\n\nThere's ten different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act. One deals with private institutions, and had I been around, I would have tried to modify that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Chairman Steele, you have worked so hard to bring minorities into the Republican Party. Here is a Senate candidate saying that he doesn't think the government, philosophically, should be able to tell a business that they can't -- that they have to serve you.\n\nSTEELE: Right, right.\n\nTAPPER: Do you have an issue with that?\n\nSTEELE: Well, I do, and I think it's important to understand that Rand Paul has clarified his statement and has reiterated his support for and, you know, movement towards pushing civil rights forward as opposed to going backwards, number one.\n\nNumber two, our party has always had a strong view on this issue. We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill. So I think that, you know, any -- any, you know, attempted look backwards, it's not in the best interests of our country, certainly, and certainly not in the best interests of the party.\n\nSo, you know, I've talked to Rand. He and I are on the same page. Our party stands four-square about moving forward on civil rights. Looking at the civil rights issues of the day -- education, for example -- there are many other fights that loom ahead for us in this area, so Rand Paul as United States senator will be four-square with the Republican Party, in lockstep with moving forward on civil rights, not looking backwards.\n\nTAPPER: Chairman Kaine, this is traditionally a Republican seat. Do these views of Rand Paul make this seat more competitive in your mind?\n\nKAINE: Absolutely, they do, Jake. Of course, it starts with our candidate, Jack Conway, who's the attorney general, I think he's going to run a great race. But Rand Paul's views on this, his statement this week that he thinks it's un-American for President Obama to try to hold British Petroleum accountable for the spill in the Gulf--\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about that. What do you think about that?\n\nSTEELE: Well, I mean, our own speaker of the House referred to American citizens as un-American, so I think referring to a policy which he did not say it was un-American per se. He said going in that direction could be an un-American--\n\nTAPPER: We have -- we actually have the video clip. Let's watch that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPAUL: What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, you know, I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP, and I think it's part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it's always got to be someone's fault, instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Certainly, accidents happen is not what you want the Republican response about the BP oil spill--\n\nSTEELE: Well, you know, well, look, I mean, it's not -- people shouldn't worry about the Republican response to the BP oil spill. They should worry about the Democrat president's response to the BP oil spill. It is one thing to actually get on the ground and get in front of this thing. It's another thing to sit back and hold BP accountable without helping them, and that's what's happening here. I mean, the federal government should have stepped into this thing immediately, to help make sure that the appropriate steps are being taken by BP, all federal agencies in support of the state government to try to get this thing cleaned up. And here we are, almost a month and a half later, and it's still spilling oil.\n\nTAPPER: How about that, Chairman Kaine? A lot of Democrats are criticizing the Obama administration for not doing enough to hold BP accountable.\n\nKAINE: The administration is doing two things. It starts with BP's accountability, and Rand Paul is wrong. It isn't un-American to hold somebody accountable for a massive environmental disaster of this kind. This isn't just a mistake that we can wash away. BP has got to be accountable for stopping the spill and then cleaning up and paying for the consequences. The administration has had a team working with BP from the very beginning trying to look at ways to help them do it, but it is BP's job. They have to be held accountable, and saying that it's just a mistake that needs to be washed away, or saying, as Rand Paul did, for example, that, you know, we needn't be so worried about things like mining regulations -- I mean, this is a very important role that the government has, to protect the safety of the environment and the health of its citizens. And so, Rand Paul's statements along these lines are very, very troubling, and it's important for Republican leaders to say whether they back this kind of an attitude or not.\n\nI was a civil rights lawyer for 17 years. Rand Paul wrote a letter about the Fair Housing Act to a local newspaper, saying a free society should tolerate private discrimination, even if it means that hate-filled groups exclude people based on the color of their skin.\n\nTAPPER: That's pretty much a direct quote.\n\nSTEELE: That's a direct quote, and it's a philosophical position held by a lot of libertarians, which Rand Paul is. They have a very, very strong view about the limitations of government intrusion into the private sector. That is a philosophical perspective. We have had a lot of members go to the United States Senate with a lot of different philosophies, but when they get to the body, how they work to move the country forward matters, and right now, the federal government is not moving forward on BP and cleaning up that mess; the federal government is not moving forward on the economy and creating jobs. There are a lot of -- there are a lot of philosophies, a lot of talk on this hill about folks to get stuff done. What the American people are looking for is what are the concrete steps that this administration has taken to clean up the mess in the Gulf before it gets worse, and to create the jobs that are necessary for people to go back to building the economy the way that everybody wants it to be.\n\nTAPPER: Fair enough, but just one more -- one more beat on Rand Paul, and that is do you condemn that point of view? I mean, where would African-Americans be if the federal government hadn't come in and said, hotels, you have to--\n\nSTEELE: Exactly. That's very much a part of the debate back in the '60s, as it is going forward. But the reality of it is, our party has stood four-square behind, you know--\n\nTAPPER: But do you condemn that view?\n\nSTEELE: I can't condemn a person's view. That's like, you know, you believe something and I'm going to say, well, you know, I'm going to condemn your view of it. It's the people of Kentucky will judge whether or not that's a view that they would like to send--\n\nTAPPER: Are you comfortable with that?\n\nSTEELE: I am not comfortable with a lot of things, but it doesn't matter what I'm comfortable with and not comfortable with. I don't vote in that election. The people of Kentucky will. As a national chairman, I'm here to say that our party will move forward in fighting for the civil rights and liberties of the American people, especially minorities in this country, and we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that everyone who's going to come to the United States Congress or go to state capitals with a Republican label are in that fight with us.\n\nTAPPER: It sounds like you're not comfortable with it.\n\nSTEELE: I just said I wasn't (ph) comfortable--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Let me turn to something to make you uncomfortable, if I can, and that is the race in Connecticut. Democratic candidate Richard Blumenthal has been caught exaggerating his war record. Here's Richard Blumenthal.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRICHARD BLUMENTHAL, CONNECTICUT SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: We have learned something very important since the days that I've served in Vietnam.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, he didn't serve in Vietnam. He was a Marine reservist--\n\nKAINE: During the Vietnam war, right.\n\nTAPPER: During the Vietnam war. He's also quoted in the Milford Mirror in 2008 (ph) saying, \"In Vietnam, we had to endure taunts and insults and no one said, welcome home. I say welcome home.\" In the Stanford Advocate in 2008, he said, \"I wore the uniform in Vietnam, and many came back to all kinds of disrespect.\"\n\nThis seems like a real trust issue that voters might have with him.\n\nKAINE: Those statements were wrong, period. They were wrong. And it was very important for him to acknowledge that and clear that up. Now, in his defense, he has given numerous speeches that are in the public record where he's talked extensively about his service, what he did, what he didn't do. One of the papers you mentioned, the Stanford Advocate, ran a very good editorial about that very thing yesterday, and reporters who covered Attorney General Blumenthal for years have said that they have never known him to exaggerate what his service was. But in those statements, he was inflating and exaggerating. They were wrong, and it was important that he set that straight.\n\nSTEELE: At a time when the American people are clearly rebelling against the same-old, same-old in politicians, Blumenthal is not the kind of guy I think they want to send anywhere, let alone to Washington to serve at this time, so I think there is a big credibility gap here. You can't say, well, you know, on the one instance, I lied to you, but on the other, since I made up for it by explaining why I lied to you. It doesn't make sense to the American people, and he's got a real problem right now, and I think that there are going to be other issues that are going to come to the fore on this, and so we'll see how it turns out.\n\nBut again, the people in Connecticut, just like the people in Kentucky, will have the final say and the ultimate say on these leaders. And you know, it's just, again, right now, there's just this mood out here that the people are sick and tired of (inaudible) -- sick and tired of the same-old in Washington. And these two examples that we're talking about are going to be judged by the people back home.\n\nKAINE: Here's the -- let me just say a word about Connecticut. I mean, the interesting thing, there's of course Attorney General Blumenthal is not a new figure for Connecticut voters. It's an intimate, small state. They know him well. They've elected him to be attorney general. He served very well in that capacity for many years. They are going to weigh this in the grand scheme of things, but they have an awful lot of his record, including the numerous occasions where he's described accurately his military service, that they can use to judge him.\n\nSTEELE: But now they have something extra that they didn't know before.\n\nTAPPER: Right. Are Democrats here in D.C. or in Connecticut at all preparing for a contingency where they might have to put another candidate up as happened with Torricelli in New Jersey?\n\nKAINE: I was in Connecticut late last week, and I'm not aware of any contingency plan up there. I think it looks like the convention was held Friday. I think they're going ahead. Connecticut voters know him.\n\nTAPPER: Moving forward to more -- out to elections in general. First of all, congratulations. There was a Hawaii special election last night that you guys won. But for competitive special elections, the Republican Party is one for four. There were two in New York, one in Pennsylvania. You did win the one in Hawaii, although the Democrat -- there were two candidates splitting the vote there. Does the Republican Party need to rethink its strategy?\n\nSTEELE: No, I mean, why do you dismiss the Hawaii vote so? Well, there was, you know, two other Democrats. That's a significant election win for us, and I'm going to -- I'm going to thank and congratulate Charles Djou on a great race, a very competitive race. That is a strong Democrat state, with very, very strong Democrat competitors that he ran against. I believe the voters there -- he took almost 40 percent of the vote, which is a significant number. He ran a grassroots campaign that was focused on the issues that impact the people of Hawaii. So don't just take away from that race, you know, sort of shoving it off. It is a significant win. It is the birthplace of the president of the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Not everybody in your party think that way.\n\nSTEELE: Well, that's irrespective (ph) -- that's where the man was born--\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSTEELE: -- and we're proud of the fact that we were able to take that seat, just like we'll take his Senate seat in November.\n\nKAINE: Jake, just for your viewers, of course the issue about the Hawaii race is for a special election, it's just a runoff, no primary. Three candidates ran, a Republican and two Democrats--\n\nTAPPER: You guys couldn't convince one of the two Democrats to drop out of the race.\n\nKAINE: Democrats are a fiery bunch, and if they want to run, they want to run. But let me just finish, Democrats got 60 percent of the vote in that race last night, and in the November--\n\nSTEELE: Yes, but you didn't win.\n\nKAINE: In the November election, it will be one Democrat against one Republican, and we feel very, very confident about winning that race.\n\nSTEELE: And Hawaii (inaudible), they don't have a history of throwing incumbents out of office, so, you know, you've got--\n\nKAINE: A three-month incumbent may be different.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Both good points. To the Pennsylvania 12th--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Isn't that the kind of race you need to win?\n\nSTEELE: Well, look at the Pennsylvania 12th, folks. I mean, yes, on paper, you would think so, right? Why? Because it's Appalachia and it's a largely conservative--\n\nTAPPER: Conservative Democrats. John McCain won the district. The Democrat was a staffer for John Murtha.\n\nSTEELE: Yes, but -- OK, can we -- can we be real here and get out of the conventional wisdom that Washington oftentimes gets stuck in? The reality of it here is, number one, hats off and kudos to Governor Rendell. He had a political genius point where he put the primary and the special election on the same day, and you guys wrote about, oh, gee, what does this mean? What's the mystery here?\n\nWell, it's no mystery, because what happened was the voters went in to vote for Sestak for the primary and then had to flip the ballot over and then vote against him for the special election? They weren't going to do that.\n\nSo that, coupled with the 2-to-1 Democratic, you know, edge there made that a tough race from the very, very beginning. But the thing to keep in mind from our perspective -- and the governor certainly can appreciate this -- we were on our point in terms of our turnout, our voter turnout models, exceeded expectations. Our ground game was strong. And in November, we'll get that seat back, because then, guess what, independent conservatives get to play then, and that'll be a very different race.\n\nTAPPER: Are you going to take the House back in November?\n\nSTEELE: We're working very hard to do that. But as you can see, you know, with -- some incumbents going down in primaries and newer players coming to the table, that model is still being built up for us. But absolutely, we're in the hunt. Just as he's in the hunt to protect, we're in the hunt to take.\n\nKAINE: Jake, we're going to hold on to both houses, and I'll tell you why -- what this Pennsylvania 12th says. The Republican leadership said they were going to win this race. They said it was exactly the kind of district that they had to win to get a majority in the House.\n\nWe won it not just by a little, we won it by a lot, in a district, as you pointed out, that John McCain won in 2008. A former head of the NRCC, Tom Davis, a Virginia congressman, said, look, if they can't win this seat, where's the wave that's coming?\n\nAnd the -- and the point that was very helpful is, Democrats were energized. Just like in Kentucky -- there's been all this focus on the Rand Paul race. The Democratic candidates in that primary in Kentucky both got more votes than Rand Paul did.\n\nOur voters are energized after the passage of health care. With the economy improving, GDP growing again, we're going to pass soon in 2010 a mark where we will have created more jobs in the American economy in 2010 than in the entire eight years of the Bush administration. Things are looking up.\n\nTAPPER: Let me interrupt. And -- and -- and you'll want me to. I only -- I only have a couple minutes, and I want to ask you about an interview that Sestak -- Congressman Sestak -- who beat Arlen Specter gave in February to legendary Philadelphia newsman Larry Kane on Comcast, in which he said that the White House tried to offer him something in exchange for not running against Arlen Specter in the primary. Here's that interview.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKANE: Were you ever offered a federal job to get out of this race?\n\nSESTAK: Yes.\n\nKANE: Was it Navy secretary?\n\nSESTAK: No comment, though I would never get out for a deal. I'm in this for the Democratic--\n\nKANE: OK, so but--\n\nSESTAK: -- principles--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKANE: Was there a job offered to you by the White House? That's what it was?\n\nSESTAK: Yes.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Very quickly, because we're running out of time, does the White House have a responsibility to own up and talk about what exactly was offered?\n\nKAINE: I don't know that they do. I mean, the issue is what the White House needs to do now, along with us, is working with -- with him to make sure he's the next senator. He's been a great congressman. I talked to -- I talked to Joe earlier this week. We had a great visit on Thursday. And he was very excited about working hand in hand to win this race. We're a big tent party. Obviously, he's a dynamite campaigner. He showed that on Tuesday, and I think he gives us a great shot in November.\n\nSTEELE: Oh, that's -- that's rich. You -- you don't believe the White House has an obligation here to own up and answer a simple question? Did you or did you not offer a member of the United States Congress a job to run for office?\n\nTAPPER: Very quickly. We only -- I only have time for one more question. Very quickly, because you haven't done a Sunday show since that whole club voyeur controversy happened in February, there was a new report indicating that the RNC spent $2,000 on athletic and softball equipment. Can -- can donors to the Republican National Committee know that their money is being well spent?\n\nSTEELE: Absolutely they can. And the reality of it is, we have taken aggressive steps to-- to make the changes that are necessary. Our donors are strong. We're raising money, and we're looking forward to using that money to beat this guy in November.\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\nKAINE: I can say with experience, they had a good softball team before they bought the equipment.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you so much. You guys were wonderful.\n\nTAPPER: President Obama announcing a bipartisan commission to investigate the oil spill, one of the topics for our roundtable this morning with, as always, George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, ABC's own Sam Donaldson, and ABC's own Cokie Roberts.\n\nGeorge, I'm going to start with you. Let's talk about Rand Paul. You heard Chairman Steele say he's not comfortable with Rand Paul's views on aspects of the Civil Rights Act. Is this a problem for the Republican Party?\n\nWILL: Sure. And there's no reason to believe Rand Paul is a racist. There is now reason to believe that he's frivolous, that is, that he doesn't understand that his job is to win a Senate seat and not conduct a seminar on libertarian philosophy.\n\nThe simple fact is that, in 1964, we as a nation repealed one widely exercised right, the right of private property owners to serve in public accommodations whom they want, and replaced it with another right, that is, the right of the entire American public to use public accommodations.\n\nWe were correct to do so. And in the process, we refuted an old notion, that you cannot -- and this offends some libertarians -- the notion was you cannot legislate morality. Yes, you can. We did.\n\nWe not only got African-Americans into public accommodations, we changed the thinking of the white portion of the country, as well.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, I've heard it said that Kentucky might be one of five or six states where a guy like Rand Paul can win.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, Kentucky is a red state. And I thought after Tuesday night that Rand Paul had a real clear path to victory. I don't think that he has a clear path anymore.\n\nFirst of all, I -- not only did Rand Paul struggle with his -- his answers the day after, but his extreme views are now under the microscope. And the people of Kentucky, I don't believe, are interested in sending him to Washington, D.C., to further polarize this country and polarize the Senate.\n\nSo Jack Conway, the Democratic nominee, his challenge is to show the Kentucky voters that Rand Paul is basically out of touch with the mainstream of Kentucky and out of touch with the mainstream of America.\n\nTAPPER: Sam?\n\nDONALDSON: Forty-six years later, after the Civil Rights Act filibuster was broken -- and I was in the gallery -- when Everett McKinley Dirksen, the Republican leader supporting the bill, made the last speech to break that filibuster.\n\nDr. Paul thinks we should reopen the debate on Title II. He says he supports the other titles of the act, but Title II is the one where you can sit down at a lunch counter, you can have breakfast someplace, you can go to a motel, and all that. He says, well, maybe there's -- that's private business.\n\nTAPPER: Now, he says he doesn't want to overturn it, but just philosophically, he wouldn't have supported that part of...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Well, he said, in one of the interviews, that if he had been in the Senate, he would have tried to modify that.\n\nROBERTS: Right.\n\nDONALDSON: OK. So you don't overturn it, you modify it, so maybe it doesn't do those things.\n\nROBERTS: (inaudible) more discussion.\n\nDONALDSON: On the Rachel Maddow show -- now, I believe as you do, George, he's probably not an internal racist, as I understand that definition, but he was asked finally, having skipped and gone back and forth, a direct question. Should Woolworth lunch counter be allowed to discriminate? Answer yes or no, she said. We're listening. He doesn't say yes, but he doesn't say no.\n\nYou say that's frivolous? I think that's stupid.\n\nROBERTS: But, you know, I -- I'm not sure, Donna, that the voters this year care about somebody being out of the mainstream. I mean, the people they are choosing in these primaries are definitely people who are out of the mainstream, whether it's in Utah or whether it's in -- in -- in -- Arkansas is still out -- up for grabs, but it looks like it's going toward the more liberal candidate in Arkansas.\n\nTAPPER: That's the Bill Halter versus Blanche Lincoln race.\n\nROBERTS: Right. I mean, it is in -- in state after state, it is not the mainstream candidate the voters are interested in.\n\nTAPPER: And, Cokie, isn't it -- isn't it fair to say that the same quality that got Rand Paul elected to that nomination...\n\nROBERTS: Could get him elected to the Senate.\n\nTAPPER: Well, the idea -- this candor of his, this -- this philosophy, this isn't out of nowhere. This is who he is. This is what appealed to some people.\n\nROBERTS: Right, and a lot of people, that he was real, that he wasn't -- you know, wasn't a phony. But, you know, when you find out somebody's not a phony and what they're real about is -- is -- I don't care whether he's a racist or not -- the views are racist.\n\nDONALDSON: But you say which voters? Which voters? It can't be all the voters. I mean, the Democrats still have a lot of voters out there. They've elected a lot of people, including a president. And in the race, as pointed out by the chairman, the Democratic chairman, the Democrats' two candidates running got 60 percent of the vote.\n\nTAPPER: In Hawaii you're talking about?\n\nROBERTS: No, no, in Kentucky.\n\nTAPPER: Oh, Kentucky. The two Democrats...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: So who is going to win in Kentucky? I can't predict. If I've learned anything after all these years as a political reporter, don't predict anything. But I would be shocked -- I'll say that now -- if Rand Paul gets most of Kentucky's votes and becomes the senator.\n\nBRAZILE: This was a closed primary. And there's an internal struggle going on in the Republican Party for the heart and soul of the Republican Party, and I hope George can address just what side will eventually come out on top. But Rand Paul is able to energize the Republican Party right now because there's a vacuum. There's a vacuum of leadership. And the Tea Party has filled that gap.\n\nThe question is, in the fall, when independents are able to get to the table and vote, will they support someone whose views are considered out -- outside the mainstream?\n\nROBERTS: That is the question.\n\nDONALDSON: Are you comfortable?\n\nWILL: The good news about the whole Rand Paul dispute is this. We really do close some questions in this country. Some debates come to an end. A hundred and fifteen years ago, Democrats were all up in arms about free coinage of silver. We sort of settled that question and moved on.\n\nROBERTS: Or on prohibition. We've sort of settled that one.\n\nWILL: And yet no one in America -- no one in America wants to reopen the argument that Rand Paul has reopened.\n\nDONALDSON: What about doing away with the Federal Reserve Board?\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\nDONALDSON: And replacing it with nothing?\n\nBRAZILE: Or abolishing the Education Department or the income tax?\n\nROBERTS: Or the FDA?\n\nTAPPER: Well, our discussion...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: I'm for most of those.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTAPPER: Our discussion here on politics will continue after the break and during the break, probably. Plus, Mexico's president enters the immigration fray, and the politics of the BP oil spill. And later, of course, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nFALLON: In a new interview on ABC's \"Nightline,\" Jesse James said he's probably the most hated man in the world. Yes. Then the CEO of BP was like, \"Dude, don't flatter yourself.\"\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJACKSON: You've been a longtime advocate for abstinence education. And in 2006, you had your staff conduct a report entitled \"Abstinence and its Critics,\" which discredits many claims purveyed by those who oppose abstinence education. What did you think of this hearing?\n\nSOUDER: Well, I personally feel I should have probably abstained from the hearing.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Former Congressman Souder of Indiana, who resigned this week, and that -- he was being interviewed by the staff member with whom, allegedly, he had the affair.\n\nMoving on, our roundtable...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: ... our roundtable continues, of course, with George Will, as always, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, ABC's own Sam Donaldson, and ABC's own Cokie Roberts.\n\nYou want to say something?\n\nDONALDSON: You're not -- you're not being fair, because he doesn't mean that he recused himself because he was having an affair with her. He went on to say that he could recuse himself for other reasons. That's why I say I want fairness to be...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: I appreciate that, Sam, always, always with the fairness. Let's talk about the Pennsylvania Senate race and Congressman Joe Sestak's defeat of Arlen Specter. Here is a little clip from an ad that Sestak ran against Specter that is widely considered to be one of the most effective ads of this election cycle.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSPECTER: My change in party will enable me to be re-elected.\n\n(UNKNOWN): For 45 years, Arlen Specter has been a Republican politician.\n\nBUSH: I can count on this man. See, that's important. He's a firm ally.\n\n(UNKNOWN): But now...\n\nSPECTER: My change in party will enable me to be re-elected.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Wow.\n\nBRAZILE: Wow.\n\nTAPPER: So, first of all, let me ask you a question, George. This -- this -- the Republicans are trying to make hay over this alleged deal that the White House made to Sestak. If you don't run against Specter, we'll give you this other job. A big deal or not a big deal?\n\nWILL: Not a big deal. It's -- politics is a transactional business. They offered him a transaction -- if they did, and I don't see a thing wrong with it.\n\nTAPPER: They are trying to make a big thing out of it, though.\n\nWILL: I don't care what they're trying to do. It's a small thing.\n\nLook, not since 1980, when four incumbent senators were defeated in -- for re-nomination, has more than one been. This year, already two have. Specter's the second; Bennett of Utah was the first. We also have Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas, the appointed Senator Bennet in Colorado is a third, and McCain's fate is still in doubt. So we could have five, and that's part of the tone of the year.\n\nBut Arlen Specter, as we saw in this ad, when he changed party, there was an agreeable absence of moralism, and opportunism reigned. He said, \"I'm just doing this to save my own skin.\" It didn't work.\n\nROBERTS: But it couldn't be a worse year for that. It could not be a worse year for that, because people are in this mood of hating professional politicians, hating Washington, and -- and for him to just say, I'm doing this to win, and the end of that ad says he was protecting one job, his. And, I mean, just people hate the phoniness of it all.\n\nTAPPER: But, you know, there is one aspect to the Specter failure to be -- to win that primary that I want to get into. Donna, here's President Obama campaigning -- he's on the trail -- with the four candidates -- with the four candidates that -- that he is supporting as president. They are Creigh Deeds in Virginia, Jon Corzine in New Jersey, Martha Coakley in Massachusetts, and, of course, Arlen Specter. Do we have that tape?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: We know where Martha Coakley stands.\n\nArlen knew that it was more important to answer to the people who sent him to Washington.\n\nYou're going to be looking at the next governor of the commonwealth of Virginia, Creigh Deeds.\n\nYour governor, my friend, Jon Corzine.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Donna, he's 0-for-4.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, I wouldn't blame this on President Obama, because...\n\nTAPPER: He didn't help.\n\nBRAZILE: ... Arlen Specter has been running for office as long as President Obama has been alive, almost. The question is, could he transfer the kind of support he had in Philadelphia and other places to Arlen Specter? And the answer is no.\n\nJoe Sestak ran a Democratic campaign. He won three out of the four largest counties outside of Philadelphia. He won Alleghany County and Pittsburgh. He ran the kind of campaign that Hillary Clinton ran against Barack Obama in Pennsylvania.\n\nSo it was an uphill battle for Senator Specter. I'm sorry, but when you announce that you're saving your job and not the jobs of the people of the state, that's a losing...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Why -- why didn't Specter do what Ronald Reagan did in reverse? Why didn't Specter say, \"I didn't leave the Republican Party. The Republican Party left me\"?\n\nROBERTS: He did.\n\nDONALDSON: I mean -- no, he didn't.\n\nROBERTS: He did at one point.\n\nDONALDSON: He said re-election. He didn't. Excuse me. You saw the tape. Can we play the tape again for Cokie?\n\nROBERTS: He did both. He said both.\n\nDONALDSON: All right. Let me just -- let me just continue then, if I may. Thank you. What's the name of that town you're from, New Orleans? OK. But, again, I think Specter did it to himself. I pick up the paper the next day, and the New York Times headline -- I may not have it exact, but it's close -- \"Voters are after incumbents.\" In other words, this was -- it wasn't an incumbent's failure. It was Arlen Specter's failure in Pennsylvania.\n\nTAPPER: Do you agree with that?\n\nDONALDSON: Now, please.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Arlen Specter -- but he did say the Republican Party had become too conservative for his moderate views.\n\nDONALDSON: But not in that clip there.\n\nROBERTS: Not in that clip.\n\nDONALDSON: That was the bottom line.\n\nROBERTS: But he's -- look, Arlen Specter lost -- finally, when he won for the Senate the first time was because he was running against someone who had lost more than he had. I mean, he had lost more campaigns than you can possibly imagine, but finally somebody had to win out of two losers running against each other.\n\nAnd he -- and he has gotten re-elected as the incumbent, but with difficulty. And -- and it was hardly surprising to have him, in a year of anti-incumbency, when it seems phony for him to switch, and he's 80 years old, for him to lose a primary. The surprising part was that the White House backed him so strenuously in the first place and then pulled back at the end...\n\nTAPPER: Well, a lot of Democrats are actually criticizing the White House. In fact, a Virginia congressman, Gerry Connolly, was upset the president didn't do more for Specter in the closing days, and he said, \"Let me get this straight. If you think I can't win, you're not going to spend political capital on me, even though I spilled buckets of blood for you? The White House can't be keeping distance from people who have walked the plank for them even when they might lose. Loyalty matters in this business.\"\n\nDoes the White House have a problem here?\n\nROBERTS: Well, loyalty does matter, but I don't know what buckets of blood Arlen Specter spilled for the White House.\n\nDONALDSON: A word for Specter. Dana Milbank in the Post this morning, Washington Post, pointed out something that I've known for years. Arlen Specter helped put more money into National Institutes of Health, more money...\n\nROBERTS: That's true.\n\nDONALDSON: ... into the fight against cancer and other dread diseases, than any other single member of Capitol Hill. So my hat's off to him. The voters don't have to vote for him, but they have to thank him for that.\n\nROBERTS: That's true.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Let's turn to another race, and that's Blumenthal. Now, Sam, you were an artillery officer in the Army in the 1950s, First Lieutenant Donaldson.\n\nDONALDSON: Thank you.\n\nTAPPER: And you also -- you were in Vietnam covering the war for ABC News, not as a soldier. What's your take on Blumenthal? It seems to me -- look, this is a different era than mine, but people are usually pretty careful about how they talk about their service.\n\nDONALDSON: That's right. I was in the service for two-and-a-half years on active duty. We had no war, had a good time. I served briefly as a correspondent in Vietnam. That was a war. Didn't have a good time there; no one did.\n\nI don't know what got into Blumenthal. As attorney general for 20 years, great record, both parties. This -- he didn't have to tell an untruth to try to get more votes.\n\nI suspect what happened -- and I've seen the analysis which was inside him. You know, he was sorry that he hadn't served. He's trying to compensate. You start telling something, and at first you tell it right, and then you sort of slip in -- well, I can just tell it a little looser, and you tell it even looser than that, and, wham, it made it cost him the opportunity to serve.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, you're a Democratic strategist. If he came to you and said, \"What do I do?\" what would you tell him?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, he apologized, and he should continue to apologize, but he needs to get this burden off his back and get back to talking to voters about the real issues. The longer he talks about this and the more tapes and the more, you know, well, on this occasion, I said it this time, I didn't say it this time.\n\nVoters don't care about that. They care about their jobs, their health care, their way of life. Mr. Blumenthal has an incredible record of public service, but if he can't talk about the issues, voters will remember this mistake.\n\nROBERTS: If I were a Democratic strategist, I'd tell him to get out of the race.\n\nTAPPER: Just out?\n\nROBERTS: Out, because I think that -- again, it's not a year for phonies. And -- and people are going to hold this against him.\n\nDONALDSON: They will hold it against him, but don't get out. I mean, I agree with Donna. I mean, fight back. You're going to lose, maybe, because of that. But which one of us hasn't exaggerated...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: ... if you ran -- if you ran the Democratic Party, OK, if you can -- if you can play along with me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: If you were Tim Kaine, if you were Tim Kaine, what would you be doing right now?\n\nWILL: I'd be trying to get him out. Sam, look, it's all very well to embed this statement about Vietnam in some generational trauma. How do you explain the fact that he evidently told the Hartford Courant that he was the captain of a Harvard swim team when he was never on the swim team? How do you explain the fact that he goes on \"Morning Joe,\" on MSNBC, and says, \"I have never taken PAC money,\" when he really meant in previous campaigns, because in this campaign, evidently, he's taken $220,000 of PAC money. This is a serial problem.\n\nDONALDSON: I agree with you. It's a very serious mistake, and it's more than a mistake, perhaps, but I think the voters should say, \"All right. We'll make a decision about this,\" because balanced against -- that is the rest of his record. And I'm not saying, other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how do you like the play?\n\nWILL: I don't run the Democratic Party, and I hope he stays in there.\n\nBRAZILE: And I hope Linda McMahon is the Republican candidate, because it will be...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Well, should Rand Paul now drop out? We just had that discussion.\n\nTAPPER: But let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: You know what -- you know what this does show? This does show a change in consciousness when it comes to having served in Vietnam. There was a time when...\n\nROBERTS: Yes, absolutely.\n\nTAPPER: I mean, the idea of -- of bragging about having served in Vietnam, in a weird -- in a weird way, shows some sort of progress.\n\nROBERTS: Absolutely. I mean, for a long time, the whole business of Vietnam was just the opposite. And as he said, when people came home, they were castigated.\n\nTAPPER: Well, he said, \"When we came home.\"\n\nROBERTS: Well, but the -- he said some were, but he didn't -- at least didn't claim that.\n\nDONALDSON: Well, we've made progress.\n\nROBERTS: But I think the First Gulf War is what changed that. And there was pride in the military. The leadership of Colin Powell, Schwarzkopf, all of that just turned people around about the military. And we've seen that in our polling.\n\nDONALDSON: I mean, Cokie, it's not just that.\n\nROBERTS: The trust for the military has gone way, way up.\n\nDONALDSON: It's not just that. It is the reaction to some extent that you pointed out, Jake. We treated our service personnel so shabbily at the end of Vietnam, we were kind of ashamed of it. We had been beaten and all of that. So we blamed them. Well, that's ridiculous.\n\nNow, people who oppose this war in Iraq, oppose the war in Afghanistan, still honor, rightly...\n\nROBERTS: Right.\n\nDONALDSON: ... the service of the people that we've sent there to fight. And that's exactly a good thing.\n\nTAPPER: Let's turn to the special election in Pennsylvania, where the Democrat beat the Republican. You heard Tim Kaine earlier talking about how great that was for the Democratic Party. Here's an excerpt from an ad by the winner, Democrat Mark Critz.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCRITZ: I'm Mark Critz, and I approved this message because I want you to see this TV ad that the Republicans are running.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Mark Critz, he'll put the liberal agenda before Pennsylvania.\n\nCRITZ: That ad's not true. I opposed the health care bill, and I'm pro-life and pro-gun. That's not liberal.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: That's not liberal, Donna. And is that how -- is that how Democrats win, by being Republicans?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, the party's very diverse. I keep telling people we have moderates, conservatives, bland Democrats, boring Democrats. We have Democrats of every variety. He ran simply as a Democrat who represents that district, and he beat the Republican who used a playbook of trying to nationalize the election. They wanted this election to be about Pelosi and Obama, and Mark Critz, rightly, ran about the people of the Pennsylvania 12th Congressional District.\n\nWILL: The basic political fact of this year is that 70 percent of Republicans call themselves conservative or very conservative, but only 40 percent of Democrats consider themselves liberal or very liberal. So I think this is -- gives a sort of systemic imbalance in favor of the Republicans in this election.\n\nROBERTS: But Donna's right. Look, you can nationalize some elections. We saw it in '94. We saw it in 2006. And Republicans certainly think they're going to do that this year and turn it into some sort of a referendum on Obama and Pelosi, and that could happen.\n\nBut, you know, the fact is, we've been talking about it so long that the Democrats aren't idiots. You know, they -- they are able to take a look at each congressional seat and try to stop whatever national wave there is, and they did it in Pennsylvania.\n\nTAPPER: And I think Scott Brown -- I think the victory of Scott Brown...\n\nROBERTS: Got their attention.\n\nTAPPER: ... happening in January really got their attention. And Democrats argue that this is not going to be a replay of 1994 when the Republicans recaptured the House because they had that warning shot across the bow...\n\nROBERTS: That's right.\n\nTAPPER: ... of a Republican winning Ted Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts. Why do you think the Republican, Tim Murphy, why do you think he -- he lost?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, I don't know why he lost, except I think I know why the Democrat won.\n\nTAPPER: Mark Critz?\n\nDONALDSON: Yes, because he had been Murtha's long-time aide and assistant. Murtha had brought huge amounts of money -- only Robert C. Byrd beat Jack Murtha.\n\nTAPPER: Jack Murtha, the late congressman who represented that seat.\n\nDONALDSON: That's right. And he really said -- he didn't show it in the ad, because he wasn't running that kind of ad, hey, I'll continue to bring home the bacon. And the people of Johnstown said that's nice. We like the bacon.\n\nBRAZILE: Mr. Burns was told by the Republican leadership here in Washington run against Washington, and it didn't play.\n\nTAPPER: Let's turn -- I would be remiss if I didn't -- but we have two daughters of Louisiana here at the table here, and I do want to turn to the oil spill in the gulf. Cokie, you heard James Carville, the Democratic strategist, and Chris Matthews, who's certainly no enemy of this administration, berating President Obama in that clip when we came back from the break. Do you think the Obama administration is doing a good enough job with this?\n\nROBERTS: No. And I think that it is clear. The oil is gushing, and we've been lied to about how much oil is gushing, and -- and the administration authorities came out that first week and said, you know, the worst-case scenario is that it keeps up and we -- until we get the second well -- the worst-case scenario is now even worse than that, and the administration has now named a commission.\n\nNow, this is, you know -- this is what you do when you really don't have anything else to do. You name a commission. And, you know, that is -- that's not going to stop the oil.\n\nDONALDSON: How are you going to stop it? I mean, if you could stop it, BP would stop it. They're going to pay billions already. If the administration could stop it, they'd stop it. And I look at the two of you just going to beat up on them. At the moment, you can't stop it.\n\nNow, three times in the last 10 years the Minerals Management Service...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: That's the regulator in charge of making sure this type of thing doesn't happen...\n\nDONALDSON: ... warned -- warned all of these people offshore, you've got to have something in a backup for these blowout preventers. It never happened. You say, well, why not? It was the regulation. They said it should happen. Because they didn't regulate. They've let the services -- I mean, they let the companies do what they wanted.\n\nROBERTS: And the -- and the Congress has passed a law that has a $75 million -- $75 million liability for these oil companies. It's not a day of their profits.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: But the oil companies have a lot of money that goes into the political campaigns.\n\nTAPPER: Donna -- Donna, you had talked to the EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, last night. She's on her way down there right now. What did she tell you?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I wanted to talk to her about the chemical dispersants that they're using now to try to break up the oil down at the surface level.\n\nTAPPER: EPA told BP not to use the one they're using...\n\nBRAZILE: Absolutely.\n\nTAPPER: ... and BP is not going to obey that.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, and that's a problem. One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak. They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up, and try to help us conserve our -- our coastal wetlands.\n\nDONALDSON: So why haven't they been tough enough?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, because they -- because of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. I brought the piece of paper. They're sitting back saying, OK -- this is the country's response to the Exxon Valdez. There's -- basically, they're saying, it's BP's responsibility. BP has taken responsibility of giving all of the gulf states $25 million, plus an additional $15 million for tourism.\n\nROBERTS: I mean, nothing.\n\nBRAZILE: Nothing.\n\nROBERTS: Nothing.\n\nBRAZILE: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. When you talk about...\n\nROBERTS: And -- and the state can't get permission to build barrier islands which the government has been trying to build up...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: ... President Obama ran against oil -- the oil industry when he ran for president. What's going on?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: He also ran on transparency and accountability.\n\nDONALDSON: ... what's going with this management service, this Minerals Management Service. I don't know, either. Maybe the commission is going to find out.\n\nBut I'll tell you, in past regulatory problems, one of the reasons is, they're in footsies. They're playing -- in -- with the -- with the people they regulate.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: And after they leave with a government pension, they then get a good job for big salaries with the companies that they had been regulating.\n\nTAPPER: There was one other item in the news that I want to touch on before -- before we have to go to a break, and that is the president of Mexico, Felipe Calderon, came to the White House, and he came to Congress, and in both places, he criticized the Arizona immigration law. Here's President Calderon.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCALDERON: I strongly disagree with the recently adopted law in Arizona. It is a law that not only ignores a reality that cannot be erased by decree, but also introduce a terrible idea using racial profiling as the basis for law enforcement.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, I'm the spring chicken at the table, but I cannot remember a head of state from another country coming to the Congress and criticizing American laws.\n\nWILL: While he was lecturing America on moral governance, he was doing so against the backdrop of an Amnesty International report saying that migrants people -- illegals crossing through Mexico are facing a major human rights crisis, leaving them with virtually no access to justice, fearing reprisals and deportation if they complain of abuses, persistent failures by the authorities -- that would be Mr. Calderon's government, I believe -- to tackle abuses carried out against irregular migrants that have made their journey through Mexico one of the most dangerous in the world.\n\nSo he gets up and lectures us on moral governance and gets a standing ovation from Donna's party. The fact is, Mexico is -- has two big exports, oil, and their second-biggest export is poverty to the United States, from which, in remittances sent back to Mexico, they get $21 billion a year. Mr. Calderon has a stake in illegal immigration to our country.\n\nDONALDSON: President Bill Clinton went to the Great Hall of the People when Jiang Zemin was president of China. I heard President Clinton say, \"What you did in Tiananmen Square was wrong.\" He lectured. We all said, \"That's terrific,\" because it was the ox being gored on the other side.\n\nPresident Calderon represents Mexico, and he said what a lot of Americans are also saying, that that Arizona law is discriminatory and that it ought not to have been on the books.\n\nTAPPER: That law is actually supported by a majority of Americans according to polling, and I can't believe that you're actually comparing it to Tiananmen Square, right? I mean, you're not.\n\nDONALDSON: Well, I'm not comparing a massacre in Tiananmen Square to what's happening in Arizona, but you raised the subject of having someone come to another country...\n\nTAPPER: And you think it's OK?\n\nDONALDSON: ... and lecture them.\n\nROBERTS: And our president -- a lot of presidents...\n\nDONALDSON: I think in this case it's...\n\nROBERTS: ... certainly do it in Israel about settlements.

    "text":"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nFor weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city\u2019s newest luxury hotels. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project \u2014 billionaire developer Donald Trump \u2014 put himself at the center of the nation\u2019s debate over illegal immigration.\n\nTrump garnered headlines \u2014 and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him \u2014 when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and \u201crapists\u201d crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.\n\nBut a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump\u2019s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs \u2014 while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.\n\nSince Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments. Here are some of the key moments. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nAll of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something ironic,\u201d said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.\n\n\u201cThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,\u201d Arellano said in Spanish. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.\u201d\n\nInterviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.\n\nSeveral of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,\u201d said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country\u2019s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.\n\n\u201cHe might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,\u201d Gonzalez said of Trump.\n\nDonald Trump announces presidential run Share Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn MailSolid Email this link View Photos View Photos Next Image epa04803133 US businessman Donald Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances while announcing that he is running to be president of the United States, during an event at Trump Tower in New York, New York, USA, 16 June 2015. Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump said he is running for US president. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation's highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates seeking the centre-right party's nomination for the 2016 presidential elections by declaring that politicians cannot solve the US' economic problems. Trump is the 12th candidate for the Republican nomination and despite his widespread name recognition is not considered a serious contender by political observers. EPA\/JUSTIN LANE (Justin Lane)\n\nSeveral of the laborers \u2014 who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day \u2014 fumed at Trump\u2019s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.\n\n\u201cDo you think that when we\u2019re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we\u2019re raping or selling drugs?\u201d Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. \u201cWe\u2019re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site\u2019s several hundred workers.\n\n\u201cOur contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,\u201d the \u00ade-mailed statement said.\n\nLend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, \u201crequires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMichael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,\u201d Cohen said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees\u2019 status is accurate.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.\n\nHicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about illegal immigration \u2014 which included a promise to \u201cbuild a great, great wall on our southern border\u201d and bill Mexico for the cost \u2014 reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company\u2019s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rapid rejection of Trump\u2019s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country \u2014 and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe NBC television network, the Macy's department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump \u2014 part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to \"dump Trump\" by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump's hotel.\n\n\n\nAt the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump\u2019s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel\u2019s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.\n\nThe site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington \u2014 with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building\u2019s heyday as the District\u2019s main post office in the early 20th century.\n\nTrucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.\n\nAhmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. \u201cMost of the workers here are migrants,\u201d he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, what he said. They\u2019re hard workers.\u201d\n\nFor David Montoya, 28, Trump\u2019s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. \u201cEvery 18 months, I have to get it renewed,\u201d he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMontoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story \u2014 one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off \u2014 is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d he reflected, \u201cwe\u2019re more American than him.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "text":"In the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Brussels, Hillary Clinton highlighted that now is a time for steady leadership, when we must stand in solidarity with our European allies and respond firmly to defeat ISIS in a speech on counterterrorism at Stanford University.\n\nThank you. Thank you very much, Mike, thank you for the introduction, but\u2014more than that\u2014for your service to our country, and our partnership during the four years I served as secretary of state. What happens in Vladivostok stays in Vladivostok.\n\nI am delighted to be back here at Stanford. And I will never forget the day that we first brought Chelsea here. I brought her to visit when she was thinking about schools, but I knew as soon as she saw Stanford that this is where, if she were fortunate enough to be admitted, she would certainly choose to come. And, of course, I remember when Bill and I brought her here to begin her freshman year, and then the dinner for parents that Mike was referring to. So it\u2019s a great treat to be back.\n\nAnd now that my daughter is a mother herself\u2014you can imagine\u2014there\u2019s already talk, at least among one or two members of our family, since her husband is also an alum of Stanford, about how good Charlotte would look one day in Cardinal red.\n\nI am delighted to be here with some very distinguished guests. Secretary Shultz, Secretary Perry, thank you both for being here with us. Lanny, thank you. Marcos, thank you, and others. It\u2019s really a great treat for me to be not only at the university, but at this particular institute as well. You have really made Stanford a center for national security scholarship, and that is the principle reason why I am here today.\n\nYesterday\u2019s attack in Brussels was the latest brutal reminder that our fight against ISIS and radical jihadist terrorism is far from finished.\n\nMore than 30 innocent people are dead\u2014men and women, hurrying to catch a plane, or waiting for a train, or meeting a loved one. Hundreds more are wounded, including three Mormon missionaries from Utah; a U.S. Air Force officer, his wife and four children; and other Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Americans here at home are worried. The threat we face from terrorism is real, it\u2019s urgent, and it knows no boundaries. Even as Brussels grieves, the memories of Paris and San Bernardino are painfully fresh as well. On Saturday, a bombing in Istanbul killed four people, including two U.S.-Israeli dual citizens. Many other places have been targeted by terrorists in the past year alone. Hotels in West Africa. Beaches in Tunisia. A market in Lebanon. A Russian passenger jet in the Sinai.\n\nISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. It beheads civilians. It enslaves, tortures, and rapes women and girls.\n\nWalls will not protect us from this threat. We cannot contain ISIS\u2014we must defeat ISIS.\n\nThis will be one of the most important challenges facing the next president, who takes office on January 20. Our new commander in chief will walk into the Oval Office and find a world of hard choices and complex problems. That president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect the lives\u2014and livelihoods\u2014of every American, and people around the world.\n\nSo, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nToday, I want to emphasize three points.\n\nFirst, we face an adversary that is constantly adapting and operating across multiple theaters, so our response must be just as nimble and far-reaching.\n\nSecond, to defeat this transnational threat, we need to reinforce the alliances that have been core pillars of American power for decades.\n\nAnd third, we need to rely on what actually works\u2014not bluster that alienates our partners and doesn\u2019t make us any safer.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by being clear about what we are facing: ISIS controls a shrinking but still sizeable territory in Iraq and Syria. It leads a far-flung network that includes affiliates across the Middle East and North Africa, and cells in Europe, Asia, and even here in North America. It\u2019s also part of a broader ideological movement that includes other terrorist groups.\n\nWe need to do battle on all these fronts.\n\nLast year, in speeches in New York and Minneapolis, I laid out a three-part plan to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, around the world, and here at home. Recent events have only reinforced the urgency of this mission.\n\nFirst, we do have to take out ISIS\u2019 stronghold in Iraq and Syria.\n\nWe should intensify the coalition air campaign against its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure; step up support for local Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground and coalition efforts to protect civilians; and pursue a diplomatic strategy aimed at achieving political resolutions to Syria\u2019s civil war and Iraq\u2019s sectarian divide.\n\nSecond, we must dismantle the global network of terror that supplies money, arms, propaganda, and fighters. This means targeted efforts to deal with ISIS affiliates, from Libya to Afghanistan. It means going after the key enablers who facilitate illicit financial transactions and help jihadists arrange travel, forge documents, and evade detection. And it means waging online battles with extremists to discredit their ideology, expose their lies, and counter their appeals to potential recruits in the West and around the world.\n\nThird, we must harden our defenses and build our resilience here at home. We need to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack, deterring would-be terrorists and discovering and disrupting plots before they\u2019re carried out.\n\nOur enemies are constantly adapting, so we have to do the same. For example, Brussels demonstrated, clearly, we need to take a harder look at security protocols at airports and other sensitive so-called \u201csoft sites,\u201d especially areas outside guarded perimeters.\n\nTo do all this, we need an intelligence surge\u2014and so do our allies.\n\nWe also have to stay ahead of the curve technologically. That does mean working with the brightest minds here in Silicon Valley to more effectively track and analyze ISIS\u2019s social media posts and map jihadist networks online. When other candidates talk about building walls around America, I want to ask them: How high does the wall have to be to keep the internet out?\n\nAnd we also have to tackle a thorny challenge that is top-of-mind here in the Bay Area: navigating the security and civil liberties concerns surrounding the encryption of mobile devices and communications.\n\nImpenetrable encryption provides significant cybersecurity advantages, but may also make it harder for law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. ISIS knows this, too. At the same time, there are legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors\u2014including terrorists\u2014can exploit.\n\nThere may be no quick or magic fix. In the Apple case, the FBI may have found a work-around\u2014but there will be future cases, with different facts and different challenges. So the tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to protect our safety and our privacy. A National Commission on Encryption, like Senator Mark Warner and Congressman Mike McCaul are proposing, could help. And our security professionals could use the advice and talents of technology professionals to help us figure out how we do stay ahead of the terrorists.\n\nOur fight against radical jihadist terrorists will be long, and there is very real risk of future attacks here at home. But pursuing this comprehensive strategy will put us in the best position to defeat ISIS and keep our families and communities safe.\n\nThis is a very personal issue for me, having served as a Senator from New York on 9\/11. Having seen the horrors that were produced by a well-planned and executed attack on our country. Knowing how important it is that we do stay ahead of those who wish to do us great harm, without panic, without paranoia\u2014but with resolve not to give in to the very behavior the terrorists are hoping to engender.\n\nWe can\u2019t let fear stop us from doing what\u2019s necessary to keep us safe\u2014nor can we let it push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe.\n\nFor example, it would be a serious mistake to stumble into another costly ground war in the Middle East. If we\u2019ve learned anything from Iraq and Afghanistan, it\u2019s that people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can\u2014I argue, must\u2014support them, but we can\u2019t substitute for them.\n\nIt would also be a serious mistake to begin \u201ccarpet bombing\u201d populated areas \u201cinto oblivion.\u201d Proposing that doesn\u2019t make you sound tough\u2014it makes you sound like you\u2019re in over your head.\n\nSlogans aren\u2019t a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle.\n\nTo do that, we need to strengthen America\u2019s alliances in Europe, Asia, and around the world. And that is the second point I want to emphasize.\n\nOn 9\/11, NATO treated an attack against one as an attack against all. On September 12, headlines across Europe, most notably in Le Monde, proclaimed, \u201cWe are all Americans.\u201d There were very few planes in the air that day\u2014but one was a British jet carrying the UK\u2019s top national security leaders to Washington to offer any help they could.\n\nNow it\u2019s our turn to stand with Europe. We cherish the same values and face the same adversaries\u2014so we must share the same determination.\n\nThis is especially true at a time when Europe faces multiple overlapping crises\u2014from President Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, to the massive influx of refugees, to continuing economic challenges, to the rise of right-wing nationalist parties. We have made so much progress together toward the goal of a Europe that is free, whole, and at peace\u2014and we can\u2019t risk letting it fall apart now.\n\nFor decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have understood that America\u2019s alliances make us stronger. Secretary Shultz compared the slow, steady work of building diplomatic relationships to gardening. He knew that when you cultivate effective partners, you can harvest real rewards.\n\nAllies extend our reach, share intelligence, provide troops in conflicts like Afghanistan, offer bases and staging areas around the world for our military, and serve as a bulwark against competitors like Russia and China. And, by the way, both Moscow and Beijing know our global network of alliances is a significant strategic advantage they can\u2019t match.\n\nNATO, in particular, is one of the best investments America has ever made. From the Balkans to Afghanistan and beyond, NATO allies have fought alongside the United States, sharing the burdens and the sacrifices. In the 1990s, Secretary Perry helped guide NATO\u2019s expansion based on the alliance\u2019s core tenets of collective defense, democracy, consensus, and cooperative security. They became known as the \u201cPerry Principles,\u201d and they\u2019re still at the heart of what makes NATO the most successful alliance in history.\n\nTurning our back on our alliances\u2014or turning our alliance into a protection racket\u2014would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.\n\nPutin already hopes to divide Europe. If Mr. Trump gets his way, it\u2019ll be like Christmas in the Kremlin. It will make America less safe\u2014and the world more dangerous.\n\nWhen it comes to the struggle against ISIS, we need our allies as much as ever. We need them to be strong and engaged, for they are increasingly on the front lines. London, Paris, Madrid, Brussels, Istanbul\u2014they\u2019ve all been hit by terrorism. And, as we saw when a terrorist cell in Hamburg carried out the 9\/11 attacks: What happens in Europe has a way of making it to America. So it\u2019s essential that we have strong partners who can work with us to disrupt plots and dismantle networks in their own countries before they lead to attacks in ours.\n\nAmerica needs European intelligence services working hand-in-hand with our own, including where they may have better reach and expertise, like in North Africa. We need European banks to stop terrorist financing. We need European planes flying missions over Iraq and Syria, and European special forces helping train and equip local anti-ISIS forces on the ground.\n\nWe need European diplomats and development experts working to improve governance and reduce the appeal of extremism across the wide arc of instability that stretches from West Africa all the way to Asia; together, we can do more. And, more urgently, to support moderate voices and stand with Tunisians, Libyans, Kurds, and others in the region who are trying to do the right thing.\n\nAnd as we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel\u2014our strongest ally in the Middle East\u2014we also have to extend our consultations to Arab partners as well.\n\nAll of this will make America safer, and help defeat ISIS.\n\nThere is much we can do to support our European partners: helping them improve intelligence and law enforcement, facilitating information sharing, working more closely at every level. There\u2019s also more they can do to share the burden with us. We\u2019d like to see more European countries investing in defense and security, following the example Germany and others have set during the Obama administration.\n\nThe most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East. Thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Their European passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home, radicalized and battle-hardened. We need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip and start revoking passports and visas.\n\nStemming this tide will require much better coordination among every country along the way. Right now, many European nations don\u2019t even alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. And Turkey, a NATO ally, still has more work to do to control the border where most foreign fighters cross into Syria.\n\nAfter the Paris attack, France and Belgium pledged to move forward together on reforms\u2014but that\u2019s difficult without the European Union. In January, the EU announced a new, integrated counterterrorism center, but intelligence cooperation still lags, and the EU keeps delaying a vote to share traveler information between member states. It\u2019s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state.\n\nThere also has to be a special emphasis on identifying and investing in the hot spots\u2014the specific neighborhoods, prisons, and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, as we\u2019ve seen in Brussels. And it\u2019s time to make good on the promise of establishing a new unified European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen the continent\u2019s external borders, which are under unprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants.\n\nNow, this is a heartbreaking crisis.\n\nLast year, the world was horrified by the photo of a drowned toddler lying on a Turkish beach. In the months since then, hundreds more children have died trying to reach safety. We\u2019ve seen Europe and Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Middle East struggle under the weight of this challenge. It\u2019s too big for any one country\u2014or even continent\u2014to handle alone. I\u2019m glad that the EU and Turkey are now working closely together\u2014and the United States should do whatever we can to support that.\n\nThe only truly effective answer is to go to the source: End the conflict that is displacing all these people. So we have to support and maintain the ceasefire in Syria. And we should also work with our coalition partners and opposition forces on the ground to create safe areas where Syrians can remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe.\n\nIn the meantime, it would be wrong to shut our doors to orphans or to apply religious tests for people fleeing persecution. That\u2019s not who we are.\n\nBut of course we have to be vigilant in screening and vetting everyone. We can\u2019t allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations\u2014but we also have to be smart and vigilant about how we process people into our country. It would be doubly cruel if ISIS can not only force families from their homes, and but also prevent them from ever finding new ones.\n\nAnd that brings me to my third point: In our fight against radical jihadism, we have to do what actually works.\n\nOne thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims.\n\nThere are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in this country. These Americans are a crucial line of defense against terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before it\u2019s too late, and the best positioned to block it.\n\nLast year in Minneapolis, I met parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community who are working with law enforcement and mental health professionals to intervene with young people at risk of being radicalized. Efforts like that deserve more local and national support.\n\nSince 9\/11, law enforcement has worked hard to build trustful and strong relationships with American Muslim communities. As the director of the FBI told Congress: Anything that erodes that trust makes their job more difficult.\n\nWe need every American community invested in this fight, not fearful and sitting on the sidelines.\n\nSo when Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals, and for racially profiling predominantly-Muslim neighborhoods, it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s counterproductive. It\u2019s dangerous.\n\nAs a spokesman for the New York Police Department pointed out last night, that kind of blanket bigotry would treat the city\u2019s nearly 1,000 Muslim police officers as threats. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more incendiary, foolish statement,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissioner Bill Bratton of the NYPD was even more blunt this morning: He said Senator Cruz \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nDemonizing Muslims also alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk from both Republicans and Democrats about the importance of building coalitions with Muslim nations. Having actually done this, I can tell you: Insulting allies and partners is not a good way to start.\n\nAnother thing we know that does not work\u2014based on lots of empirical evidence\u2014is torture.\n\nMany intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops\u2014and, increasingly, our own civilians\u2014at greater risk.\n\nI\u2019m proud to have been a part of the administration that banned torture, after too many years in which we had lost our way.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m president, the United States will not condone or practice torture anywhere in the world.\n\nEven when we\u2019re up against opponents who don\u2019t respect human life or human rights, torture is not the right choice. As Senator John McCain has said: The high standard to which we hold ourselves \u201cisn\u2019t about our enemies; it\u2019s about us. It\u2019s about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAmerica is a great nation. And this is a time for American leadership. Smart, strong, steady leadership.\n\nNo other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale in defense of our people and our values.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t cower in fear or hide behind walls. We lead\u2014and we succeed.\n\nThroughout our history, we have stared into the face of evil and refused to blink\u2014whether it was fascism, the Cold War, or hunting down Osama bin Laden. And we will defeat ISIS, too. No enemy or adversary should ever underestimate the determination of the American people.\n\nI will never forget what it was like to arrive in Brussels for the first time as secretary of state, in March of 2009.\n\nI was on my way to NATO. NATO headquarters was buzzing. Hundreds of young people at the European Parliament had stood and cheered\u2014not for me, but for the idea of American leadership; for the promise of an alliance that delivered unprecedented peace and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThat\u2019s what we need to remember today. Americans cannot\u2014and I believe will not\u2014turn on each other, turn on our allies, or turn away from our principles.\n\nWe\u2019re in it for the long haul. And that means we\u2019re going to work together. And we\u2019re going to prevail.\n\nThis may be another one of the long struggles we have confronted from time to time in our history, but\u2014like all the rest of those\u2014if we can forge a bipartisan consensus, if we can bring our people to understand what this struggle means to us, if we can maintain our alliances and our partnerships, we will be successful.\n\nAnd that will benefit not only our country, but the world.\n\nAnd that, when you boil it down, is what American leadership has to be about.\n\nThank you.",

    "text":"PolitiFact\u2019s annotated transcript of the second presidential debate PolitiFact \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Oct 10, 2016 64 min read -- 81 Listen Share\n\nBy PolitiFact staff\n\nPolitiFact is annotating the second presidential debate at Washington University. We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.\n\nRADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\n\nAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.\n\nI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\n\nIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\n\nI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\n\nTRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\n\nWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.\n\nYou say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.\n\nBut I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\n\nYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\n\nAnd they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.\n\nYes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\n\nCOOPER: So, Mr. Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\n\nCOOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\n\nTRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\n\nCOOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.\n\nCOOPER: Have you ever done those things?\n\nTRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.\n\nWe\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\n\nDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\n\nSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\n\nSo this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\n\nCLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.\n\nRADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\n\nI\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.\n\nShe\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\n\nTRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?\n\nRADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.\n\nTRUMP: Sounds fair.\n\nRADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.\n\nTRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.\n\nIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\n\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\n\nAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.\n\nWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\n\nCLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\n\nHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d\n\nHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\n\nNumber two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\n\nSo, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\n\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.\n\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: In the first debate\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.\n\nSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nI take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.\n\nTRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nShe said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.\n\nAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\n\nOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move on.\n\nTRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\n\nRADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.\n\nTRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.\n\nCLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond, please.\n\nCLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.\n\nCLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.\n\nCLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.\n\nTRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.\n\nCLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\n\nTRUMP: Get off this question.\n\nCLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.\n\nCOOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We brought up the e-mails.\n\nTRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.\n\nCOOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\n\nCOOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\n\nCLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.\n\nTRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\n\nBut everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\n\nNumber three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before.\n\nSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.\n\nRight now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.\n\nIt\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.\n\nObamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\n\nWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.\n\nYou will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.\n\nBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, your time\u2026\n\nTRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\n\nCLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.\n\nAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\n\nThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare\u2026\n\nTRUMP: By the way\u2026\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans\u2026\n\nCOOPER: What does that mean?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\n\nTRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.\n\nAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\n\nAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\n\nAnd, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nAnd she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\n\nI want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\n\nCLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.\n\nIt\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\n\nWe are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.\n\nThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..\n\nRADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026 TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.\n\nRADDATZ: I do.\n\nTRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?\n\nRADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\n\nWe have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\n\nBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?\n\nSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: So, please\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That has not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\n\nTRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.\n\nRADDATZ: She did not.\n\nTRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?\n\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, please.\n\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.\n\nAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.\n\nICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, two, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\n\nBut, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.

And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nCLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 with the Russians and other foreign powers.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.\n\nBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.\n\nBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.\n\nI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\n\nNow, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.\n\nI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nCOOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.\n\nShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\n\nBut \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.\n\nWe\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\n\nBut we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\n\nAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\n\nCLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\n\nAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\n\nI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.\n\nWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.\n\nPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nCLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\n\nTRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.\n\nCOOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?\n\nTRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.\n\nSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.\n\nBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.\n\nCOOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\n\nTRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.\n\nHey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.\n\nCOOPER: In the past\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.\n\nTRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nTRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.\n\nCLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.\n\nEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9\/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\n\nI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nCLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.\n\nTRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.\n\nBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\n\nSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\n\nRussia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\n\nI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which\u2026\n\nCLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point\u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were\u2026\n\nCLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\n\nTRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\n\nObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\n\nNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\n\nNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.\n\nLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\n\nBut look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: And one thing I have to say.\n\nRADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\n\nTRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\n\nRADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?\n\nTRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\n\nI believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\n\nWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country?\n\nRADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.\n\nTRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.\n\nRADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.\n\nTRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\n\nNow, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\n\nCLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.\n\nI do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Everything.\n\nCLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\n\nI would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.\n\nI would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.\n\nRADDATZ: You had many answers.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.\n\nCOOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?\n\nQUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\n\nCOOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\n\nBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.\n\nTRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.\n\nSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.\n\nLet me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\n\nMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\n\nAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\n\nYou know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\n\nSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\n\nCOOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up.\n\nCLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?\n\nCLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\n\nAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you.\n\nCLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.\n\nCOOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.\n\nTRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.\n\nWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\n\nCOOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.\n\nTRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\n\nCOOPER: You mentioned sex tape.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens\u2026\n\nCOOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.\n\nNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9\/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.\n\nAnd I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move along.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to\u2026\n\nCLINTON: Five million homes were lost.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.\n\nCLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another\u2026 TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.\n\nTRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?\n\nRADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.\n\nBecause I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.\n\nI would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\n\nNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\n\nI want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\n\nSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.\n\nI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.\n\nBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.\n\nNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.\n\nSo I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.\n\nI ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?\n\nIt\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.\n\nCLINTON: Well\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.\n\nCLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\n\nCOOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?\n\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\n\nWe are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.\n\nAnd you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.\n\nI will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.\n\nYou take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.\n\nThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\n\nYou know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\n\nSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\n\nCOOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We have\u2026\n\nCOOPER: One more audience question.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\n\nSo I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.\n\nI will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.\n\nCOOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.\n\nRADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.",

    "text":"Denver CNN \u2014\n\nThe following is a transcript of Wednesday night\u2019s presidential debate in Denver.\n\n21:01:40: JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. I\u2019m Jim Lehrer of the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\n\nThis debate and the next three \u2013 two presidential, one vice presidential \u2013 are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\u2019s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\n\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.\n\nThe segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.\n\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent \u2013 no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let\u2019s start the economy, segment one, and let\u2019s begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\n\nYou have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\n\n21:04:24: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\n\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\n\nAnd so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.\n\nAnd because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.\n\nBut we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going.\n\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view.\n\nI think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\n\nNow, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2013 to you \u2013 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate.\n\n21: 06:31: LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\n\n21:06:32: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It\u2019s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I\u2019m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\n\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2013 here with me. So I\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d\n\nAnn yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do.\n\nMy plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.\n\nNumber two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.\n\nNumber three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now.\n\nNumber four, get to us a balanced budget.\n\nNumber five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.\n\nNow, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2013 if you will, trickle-down government \u2013 would work.\n\nThat\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\n\n21:08:40: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down \u2013 his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.\n\n21:08:50: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.\n\nSo now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\n\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\n\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\n\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?\n\nAnd this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2013 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2013 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2013 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\n21:11:03: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we\u2019re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.\n\nBut, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you\u2019d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?\n\n21:11:03: ROMNEY: Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am.\n\nThe people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2013 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing.\n\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.\n\nAnd so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2013 the cornerstones of my plan.\n\nBut the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\n\nThe second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\n\nThe third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.\n\nMr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2013 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada.\n\nAnd, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\n\nAnd finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2013 the revenues going to the government. My \u2013 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.\n\nBut I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2013 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2013 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:14:22: OBAMA: Well, I think \u2013 let\u2019s talk about taxes, because I think it\u2019s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.\n\nAnd the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.\n\nNow, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim.\n\n21:16:34: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:36: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can \u2013 are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don\u2019t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\n\nOBAMA: And that\u2019s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\u2019s pledge of not reducing the deficit or \u2013 or \u2013 or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not my analysis. That\u2019s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And \u2013 and that kind of top \u2013 top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\u2019s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\n\n21:16:37: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let\u2019s just stay on taxes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Just \u2013 let\u2019s just stay on taxes for (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: What is the difference\u2026\n\n21:16:42: ROMNEY: Well, but \u2013 but virtually \u2013 virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\n\n21:16:43: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:44: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\u2019d say absolutely not. I\u2019m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I\u2019ve said is I won\u2019t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\u2019s part one. So there\u2019s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\n\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\u2019s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\u2019s just not the case. Look, I\u2019ve got five boys. I\u2019m used to people saying something that\u2019s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\u2019ll believe it. But that \u2013 that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\n\nAnd number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\u2019s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\u2019re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.\n\nThere are all these studies out there. But let\u2019s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates.\n\nAnd the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:18:30: LEHRER: That\u2019s where we started. Yeah.\n\nDo you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?\n\n21:18:34: OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he\u2019s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic.\n\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2013 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\n\nBut I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\nAnd the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\n\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2013 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened.\n\nBut under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2013 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income.\n\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\n\n21:21:01: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:21:03: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that \u2013 on that point, which is these\u2026\n\n21:21:04: LEHRER: Just for the \u2013 just for record\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:21:07: ROMNEY: \u2026 the small businesses we\u2019re talking about\u2026\n\n21:21:09: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we\u2019re way over our first 15 minutes.\n\n21:21:10: ROMNEY: It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\n\n21:21:11: LEHRER: It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s great. No problem. Well, you all don\u2019t have \u2013 you don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t have a problem, because we\u2019re still on the economy. We\u2019re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.\n\nOK, but go ahead, sir.\n\n21:21:38: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you\u2019re \u2013 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not \u2013 not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2013 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.\n\nNow, and \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2013 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\n\n21:22:58: OBAMA: Jim, I \u2013 you may want to move onto another topic, but I \u2013 I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion \u2013 just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that\u2019s more than our entire defense budget \u2013 and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\u2019s plan may work for you.\n\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\u2019ve tried this. We\u2019ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I\u2019m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\u2019ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\u2019ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\u2019re not blowing up the deficit.\n\n21:24:40: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:42: LEHRER: Well, you\u2019re going to get the first word in the next segment.\n\n21:24:48: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:50: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me \u2013 let me repeat \u2013 let me repeat what I said. I\u2019m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That\u2019s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That\u2019s point one.\n\nSo you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that\u2019s not my plan.\n\nNumber two, let\u2019s look at history. My plan is not like anything that\u2019s been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.\n\nMy priority is putting people back to work in America. They\u2019re suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It\u2019s absolutely extraordinary. We\u2019ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.\n\nGoing forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\n\n21:26:01: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s talk \u2013 we\u2019re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.\n\nAnd the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you \u2013 you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\n\n21:26:31: ROMNEY: Good. I\u2019m glad you raised that, and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a critical issue. I think it\u2019s not just an economic issue, I think it\u2019s a moral issue. I think it\u2019s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\u2019re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.\n\nAnd the amount of debt we\u2019re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\n\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\u2019re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.\n\nThe presidents would \u2013 president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\n\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don\u2019t pass it: Is the program so critical it\u2019s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I\u2019ll get rid of it. Obamacare\u2019s on my list.\n\nI apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.\n\nOBAMA: I like it.\n\nROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I\u2019ll get rid of that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Jim, I\u2019m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I\u2019m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, I\u2019ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\n\nNumber three, I\u2019ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\n\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.\n\nThe president said he\u2019d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president\u2019s put it in place as much public debt \u2013 almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.\n\n21:28:35: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\n\n21:28:37: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.\n\nAnd despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.\n\nSo 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2013 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.\n\nAnd I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nNow, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.\n\nAnd the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2013 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.\n\nLet \u2013 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.\n\nNow, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:15: OBAMA: \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.\n\n21:31:22: LEHRER: Mr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n21:31:26: OBAMA: And \u2013 and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\n\n21:31:28: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\n\n21:31:28: OBAMA: Sorry.\n\n21:31:34: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:34: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.\n\n21:31:35: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:36: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It\u2019s not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\n\n21:31:48: OBAMA: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\u2019re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But you\u2019ve been \u2013 but you\u2019ve been president four years\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:54: ROMNEY: You\u2019ve been president four years. You said you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. It\u2019s now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we\u2019ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\u2019re re-elected, we\u2019ll get to a trillion-dollar debt.\n\nI mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2013 I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done.\n\nLet me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d\n\nWell, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2013 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing. It\u2019s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.\n\nYou raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\u2019s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to kill jobs in this environment.\n\nI\u2019ll make one more point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:21: LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.\n\n21:33:22: ROMNEY: OK.\n\n21:33:23: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:33:24: OBAMA: Well, we\u2019ve had this discussion before.\n\n21:33:26: LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\n\n21:33:30: OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He\u2019s ruled out revenue.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:31: ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:30: ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That\u2019s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you\u2019ll never get there. You\u2019ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.\n\nSpain \u2013 Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We\u2019re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don\u2019t want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\u2019re working.\n\n21:34:11: LEHRER: But \u2013 but Mr. President, you\u2019re saying in order to \u2013 to get the job done, it\u2019s got to be balanced. You\u2019ve got to have\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:34:16: OBAMA: If \u2013 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.\n\nThe oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get.\n\nNow, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2013 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2013 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.\n\nWell, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\n\nRight now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue.\n\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.\n\nIt means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2013 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old.\n\nThat is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices.\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.\n\nAnd the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\n\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2013 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.\n\nNow, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\nAnd governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\n\n21:37:19: ROMNEY: Jim, let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it\u2019s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools\u2026\n\n21:37:22: LEHRER: Come back to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:37:25: ROMNEY: \u2026 to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let\u2019s go through them one by one.\n\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it\u2019s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that\u2019s been in place for a hundred years. Now\u2026\n\nOBAMA: It\u2019s time to end it.\n\nROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.\n\nNow, I like green energy as well, but that\u2019s about 50 years\u2019 worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\n\nBut, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years\u2019 worth of breaks, into \u2013 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don\u2019t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this \u2013 this is not \u2013 this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\n\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I\u2019ve been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.\n\nLEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But \u2013 but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I\u2019d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\n\nAnd, finally, Medicaid to states? I\u2019m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\u2019re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you\u2019re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\n\nAnd I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors \u2013 Republican and Democrats \u2013 said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\n\nSo \u2013 so let\u2019s state \u2013 one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don\u2019t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.\n\nAnd, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.\n\n21:39:49: LEHRER: Let\u2019s go.\n\n21:39:48: ROMNEY: But \u2013 but the right \u2013 the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\n\n21:39:52: LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\u2019re going on \u2013 still on the economy, on another \u2013 but another part of it\u2026\n\nOBAMA: OK.\n\n21:39:56: LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First \u2013 first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\n\n21:40:15: OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2013 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2013 the basic structure is sound.\n\nBut \u2013 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now.\n\nYou know, my grandmother \u2013 some of you know \u2013 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice.\n\nAnd the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\n\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going.\n\n$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a \u2013 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2013 throughout the system.\n\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\n\n21:42:38: LEHRER: We\u2019ll follow up on this.\n\nFirst, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\n\n21:42:41: ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s going to change their life for the worse.\n\nAnd the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further.\n\nBut for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not.\n\nBut on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.\n\nWe also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients.\n\nThis \u2013 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.\n\nNow, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2013 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade.\n\nI want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.\n\nBut the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\n\nAnd with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\n\n21:44:43: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:44:44: OBAMA: First of all, I think it\u2019s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.\n\nAnd the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It\u2019s called premium support, but it\u2019s understood to be a voucher program. His running mate\u2026\n\n21:45:05: LEHRER: And you don\u2019t support that?\n\n21:45:07: OBAMA: I don\u2019t. And let me explain why.\n\n21:45:08: ROMNEY: Again, that\u2019s for future\u2026\n\n21:45:09: OBAMA: I understand.\n\n21:45:10: ROMNEY: \u2026 people, right, not for current retirees.\n\n21:45:12: OBAMA: For \u2013 so if you\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re 54 or 55, you might want to listen \u2018cause this \u2013 this will affect you.\n\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.\n\nThe problem is that because the voucher wouldn\u2019t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\n\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\u2019ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\u2019s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\u2019ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.\n\nAnd then what you\u2019ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own \u2013 only my opinion. AARP thinks that the \u2013 the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \u201cObamacare,\u201d if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They\u2019re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.\n\nAnd the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\u2019t making seniors any healthier. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\n\n21:47:21: LEHRER: We\u2019ll talk about \u2013 specifically about health care in a moment. But what \u2013 do you support the voucher system, Governor?\n\n21:47:27: ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.\n\n21:47:32: LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:47:36: ROMNEY: So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice.\n\nThey get to choose \u2013 and they\u2019ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don\u2019t have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That\u2019s not going to happen. They\u2019ll have at least two plans.\n\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\u2019ll be able to get a private plan.\n\nI know my own view is I\u2019d rather have a private plan. I\u2019d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\u2019d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\u2019t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.\n\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\u2019re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\u2019s the plan that I\u2019ve put forward.\n\nAnd, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or \u2013 or Senator Wyden, who\u2019s the co-author of the bill with \u2013 with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. This is an idea that\u2019s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\n\n21:49:05: OBAMA: Jim, if I \u2013 if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.\n\nAnd private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what they do. And so you\u2019ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck.\n\nAnd this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\n\nOne last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid\u2026 LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.\n\nOBAMA: \u2026 but \u2013 but \u2013 but overall.\n\nLEHRER: OK.\n\nOBAMA: And so\u2026\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big topic. Can we \u2013 can we stay on Medicare?\n\nOBAMA: Is that a \u2013 is that a separate topic?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Yeah, we\u2019re going to \u2013 yeah, I want to get to it.\n\nOBAMA: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nLEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 before we leave the economy\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:50:20: ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\n\n21:50:25: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:50:27: ROMNEY: If that\u2019s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\n\n21:50:30: LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.\n\n21:50:32: ROMNEY: But my experience \u2013 my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\n\n21:50:38: LEHRER: All right. Can we \u2013 can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice \u2013 a clear choice between the two\u2026\n\n21:50:40: ROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 of you on Medicare?\n\nROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n21:50:42: LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there \u2013 should there be more?\n\nBeginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we\u2019ll go for a few minutes, and then we\u2019re going to go to health care, OK?\n\n21:51:07: ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can\u2019t have a free market work if you don\u2019t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have \u2013 I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn\u2019t have people opening up banks in their \u2013 in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\n\n21:51:30: LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\n\n21:51:31: ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.\n\n21:51:32: LEHRER: Like where?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:51:37: ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what\u2019s happened with some of the legislation that\u2019s been passed during the president\u2019s term, you\u2019ve seen regulation become excessive, and it\u2019s hurt \u2013 it\u2019s hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.\n\nDodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they\u2019re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that\u2019s been given to \u2013 to New York banks I\u2019ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There\u2019ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.\n\nSo there\u2019s one example. Here\u2019s another. In Dodd-Frank\u2026\n\n21:52:15: LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\n\n21:52:17: ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We\u2019re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for\u2026\n\n21:52:25: LEHRER: Well, here\u2019s a specific\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:28: ROMNEY: But let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s mention \u2013 let me mention the other one. Let\u2019s talk\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:33: LEHRER: No, let\u2019s not. Let\u2019s let him respond \u2013 let\u2019s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.\n\n21:52:41: OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.\n\nNow, it wasn\u2019t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were \u2013 that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\u2019t have been given, because the folks didn\u2019t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\u2019t.\n\nBut you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\n\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2013 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\u2019ve going to make sure that you\u2019ve got to have a living will so \u2013 so we can know how you\u2019re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\u2019t have other taxpayer bailouts.\n\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.\n\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nAnd, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.\n\nAnd so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\u2019s not what I believe.\n\n21:54:42: ROMNEY: Sorry, but that\u2019s just not \u2013 that\u2019s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That\u2019s why I\u2019d have regulation. But I wouldn\u2019t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\u2019s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\u2019t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\u2019s killing regional and small banks. They\u2019re getting hurt.\n\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\u2019t qualified. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\u2019s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\u2019t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years. We don\u2019t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\u2019s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\u2019s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\u2019t come out with a clear regulation.\n\nI will make sure we don\u2019t hurt the functioning of our \u2013 of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\n\n21:55:55: LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let\u2019s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it\u2019s a two-minute new \u2013 new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.\n\nYou want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\n\n21:56:20: ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\u2019t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAnd the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2013 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, when \u2013 when \u2013 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it.\n\nSecond reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\n\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea.\n\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2013 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\n\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.\n\n21:58:19: LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal?\n\n21:58:20: OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn\u2019t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\u2019t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn\u2019t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.\n\nIf they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they\u2019re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they\u2019ve hit the limit.\n\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.\n\nAnd let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you\u2019ve got health insurance, it doesn\u2019t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around. They can\u2019t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance \u2013 your insurance plan until you\u2019re 26 years old. And it also says that you\u2019re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\n\nNumber two, if you don\u2019t have health insurance, we\u2019re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you\u2019re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\n\nNow, the last point I\u2019d make before\u2026\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes \u2013 two minutes is up, sir.\n\nOBAMA: No, I think \u2013 I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 the irony is that we\u2019ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn\u2019t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\n\n22:01:01: LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.\n\nAll right, Governor. Governor, tell \u2013 tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?\n\n22:01:10: ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:01:13: ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2013 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.\n\nSo entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.\n\nWhat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $716 billion.\n\nWe didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2013 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\n\nRight now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\n\nSo for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2013 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2013 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.\n\nI think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\n\n22:03:12: OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\n\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan.\n\nIt \u2013 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?\n\nBecause there \u2013 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line.\n\nOr, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it.\n\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2013 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2013 they\u2019ve engaged in.\n\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2013 it\u2019s true \u2013 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate.\n\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2013 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026\n\n22:06:24: LEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\n22:06:25: OBAMA: \u2026 at a time when it\u2019s vitally important.\n\n22:06:26: LEHRER: Let\u2019s let the governor explain what you would do\u2026\n\n22:06:27: ROMNEY: Well\u2026\n\n22:06:28: LEHRER: \u2026 if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:06:33: ROMNEY: Well, actually it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.\n\nBut let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nIn my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2013 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.\n\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.\n\nThis is the private market. These are small \u2013 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2013 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.\n\nIn order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.\n\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.\n\nThat\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\n\n22:08:36: OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\u2019re talking about can\u2019t make decisions about what treatments are given. That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nWell, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2013 if it\u2019s been under 90 days.\n\nBut that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d\n\nNow, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2013 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.\n\nIt just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry.\n\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2013 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?\n\nNo. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\n\n22:11:05: LEHRER: We\u2019re going to move to\u2026\n\n22:11:06: ROMNEY: No. I \u2013 I have to respond to that.\n\n22:11:08: LEHRER: No, but\u2026\n\n22:11:10: ROMNEY: Which is \u2013 which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and \u2013 and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway,\u201d I don\u2019t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\u2019ve said the same thing, you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\n\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2013 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2013 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time.\n\nThe federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\n\n22:12:45: LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And \u2013 and let\u2019s see. Role of government. And it is \u2013 you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you \u2013 but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President \u2013 do you believe there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\n\n22:13:14: OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.\n\n22:13:15: LEHRER: And do you \u2013 yeah.\n\n22:13:16: OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office.\n\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.\n\nLook, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.\n\nBut as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it.\n\nAnd so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.\n\nAnd when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.\n\nIt can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce.\n\n22:15:40: LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\n\n22:15:43: ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.\n\nSo I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\n\nThe role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.\n\nFirst, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military.\n\nSecond, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2013 by one another.\n\nWe\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2013 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\n\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2013 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working.\n\nAnd the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work.\n\n22:17:48: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:17:49: ROMNEY: We know that the path we\u2019re taking is not working. It\u2019s time for a new path.\n\n22:17:50: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s go through some specifics in terms of what \u2013 how each of you views the role of government. How do \u2013 education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\n\n22:18:03: ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is \u2013 is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I \u2013 and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he\u2019s \u2013 some ideas he\u2019s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and \u2013 and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and \u2013 and state schools to do a better job.\n\nMy own view, by the way, is I\u2019ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I \u2013 these are disabled kids or \u2013 or \u2013 or poor kids or \u2013 or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.\n\nSo all federal funds, instead of going to the \u2013 to the state or to the school district, I\u2019d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their \u2013 their \u2013 their student.\n\n22:18:50: LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\u2019s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\n\n22:18:57: OBAMA: Well, as I\u2019ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we\u2019ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they\u2019re having an impact right now.\n\n22:19:20: LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and \u2013 and those of Governor Romney on \u2013 about education and the federal government?\n\n22:19:25: OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we\u2019re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\n\nYou know, his \u2013 his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\u2019s talked about. And it wasn\u2019t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But \u2013 but what it did do is to \u2013 if you extrapolated how much money we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\u2019re setting up their training programs\u2026\n\n22:20:20: LEHRER: Do you \u2013 do you agree, Governor?\n\n22:20:21: OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:20:23: OBAMA: The \u2013 where they\u2019re partnering so that they\u2019re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\n\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.\n\nAnd we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.\n\nGovernor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option.\n\nAnd for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term.\n\n22:21:59: LEHRER: We\u2019re running out of time, gentlemen.\n\n(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?\n\n22:22:05: ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you\u2019re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I\u2019m not going to cut education funding. I don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and \u2013 and grants that go to people going to college. I\u2019m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\u2019m not planning on making changes there.\n\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into \u2013 into green jobs. And I \u2013 look, I\u2019m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have \u2013 that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion.\n\nAnd these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\n\nLook, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.\n\nThe right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2013 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education. It\u2019s because I care about education for all of our kids.\n\n22:23:49: LEHRER: All right, gentlemen\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:23:51: LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 barely have three minutes left. I\u2019m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\u2019ve done a poor job.\n\nOBAMA: You\u2019ve done a great job.\n\nLEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government \u2013 the role of government and governing, we\u2019ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three \u2013 three minutes left in the \u2013 in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we\u2019ve got three minutes total time here \u2013 and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?\n\nGovernor?\n\n22:24:41: ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time \u2013 of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.\n\n22:24:50: LEHRER: But what would you do as president?\n\n22:24:50: ROMNEY: We \u2013 as president, I will sit on day one \u2013 actually, the day after I get elected \u2013 I\u2019ll sit down with leaders \u2013 the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue \u2013 as we did in my state \u2013 we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the \u2013 in the \u2013 in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we\u2019re going to compromise our principle, but because there\u2019s common ground.\n\nAnd the challenges America faces right now \u2013 look, the reason I\u2019m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face \u2013 this deficit could crush the future generations. What\u2019s happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.\n\n22:25:53: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:25:53: ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership \u2013 leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if \u2013 if it\u2019s a Republican or a Democrat. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ll do it again.\n\n22:25:56: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n22:25:57: OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\u2019s going to have a busy first day, because he\u2019s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\u2019re sitting down with them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\u2019re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask\/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That\u2019s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.\n\nSo we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down,\u201d but you have to have a plan.\n\nNumber two, what\u2019s important is occasionally you\u2019ve got to say no, to \u2013 to \u2013 to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when \u2013 when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.\n\nWhen \u2013 when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\n\nLEHRER: All right\n\nOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\n\n22:27:53: LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\n\n22:28:05: OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\n\nYou know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession.\n\nThe auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.\n\nAll those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is \u2013 is channeled and \u2013 and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair shot. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair share \u2013 everybody\u2019s doing a fair share, and everybody\u2019s playing by the same rules.\n\nYou know, four years ago, I said that I\u2019m not a perfect man and I wouldn\u2019t be a perfect president. And that\u2019s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\u2019ve kept. But I also promised that I\u2019d fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I\u2019ve kept that promise and if you\u2019ll vote for me, then I promise I\u2019ll fight just as hard in a second term.\n\n22:30:17: LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\n\n22:30:18: ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\n\nThis is a \u2013 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.\n\nI \u2013 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\n\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths.\n\nBut they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.\n\nThere\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.\n\nI\u2019ll get incomes up again.\n\nYou\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.\n\nIf I\u2019m president I will create \u2013 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\n\nIf the president\u2019s re-elected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.\n\nIf I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\n\nIf the president were to be re-elected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients.\n\nI\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.\n\nAnd finally, military. The president\u2019s re-elected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.\n\nI will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\u2019s middle class working again.\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nLEHRER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I\u2019m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)",

    "text":"April 18, 2010 \u2014 -- Bill Clinton made mistakes as president on financial regulation, he admitted in an exclusive \"This Week\" interview, but Clinton stood his ground regarding the dangers of overheated political rhetoric, saying Rush Limbaugh's accusation Clinton \"set the stage for violence\" with a recent speech on the subject \"doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nIn his first \"This Week\" interview since the passage of health care reform, Clinton reflected on how the bill's success made him feel like Teddy Roosevelt to Obama's FDR. And Clinton offered advice and thoughts on some of Obama's next issues -- a Supreme Court nomination, the Middle East peace process and the midterm elections.\n\nAnchor Jake Tapper asked Clinton about Limbaugh's criticism of his speech marking the upcoming 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. In that speech, Clinton warned that \"the words we use really do matter, because there's this vast echo chamber, and they go across space and they fall on the serious and delirious alike. They fall on the connected and the unhinged alike.\"\n\nOn \"This Week,\" Clinton said, \"The only point I tried to make was that we ought to have a lot of political dissent -- a lot of political argument. Nobody is right all the time. But we also have to take responsibility for the possible consequences of what we say.\"\n\nClinton said he worries about threats against President Obama and the Congress. And, he worries \"about more careless language ... some of which we've seen against the Republican governor in New Jersey, Gov. Christie.\"\n\nA recently leaked memo from a New Jersey teacher joked about Christie dying.\n\n\"I think we all have to be careful,\" Clinton said. \"We ought to remember [that] after Oklahoma City we learned something about the difference in disagreement and demonization.\"\n\nClinton acknowledged that he was wrong to take what he now views as bad advice from his Treasury secretaries, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who told him the market for complex financial instruments known as derivatives ought to remain unregulated.\n\n\"On derivatives, yeah, I think they were wrong and I think I was wrong to take [their advice],\" Clinton said, \"because the argument on derivatives was that these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them, and they don't need any extra protection and any extra transparency. The money they're putting up guarantees them transparency.\n\n\"The flaw in that argument,\" Clinton added, \"was that first of all sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency.\"\n\nThe former president said he also was wrong in his understanding of what a collapse in the derivative market could do to the economy.\n\n\"The most important flaw,\" he said, \"was even if less than 1 percent of the total investment community is involved in derivative exchanges, so much money was involved that if they went bad, they could affect 100 percent of the investments, and indeed 100 percent of the citizens in countries, not investors. And I was wrong about that.\"\n\nHe now wishes he had tried to regulate derivatives while in office, but he doesn't think he would have been successful.\n\n\"Now, I think if I had tried to regulate them, because the Republicans were the majority in the Congress, they would have stopped it,\" he said. \"But I wish I should have been caught trying. I mean, that was a mistake I made.\"\n\nBill Clinton's Supreme Court Nominee Advice: Robe Not Required\n\nClinton said a robe isn't necessarily a requirement for being nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\nAsked about his advice for President Obama as he selects a nominee to be the next Supreme Court justice, Clinton said he hopes the president will \"take a look at somebody who hasn't been a judge.\"\n\n\"The important thing,\" Clinton said, \"is that you think they're smart and they're competent and they understand the lives of ordinary people.\"\n\nWhen asked if he or his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be suited for the job, Clinton said at 63, he's too old and, \"I'd like to see him put someone in their late 40s, early 50s on the court and someone with a lot of energy for the job.\"\n\nHillary Clinton, he said, would have the same advice.\n\nDiversity, he suggested, should also be a consideration.\n\n\"My advice to him would be to first of all see what the court is missing,\" Clinton said. \"Does it matter if he puts a Catholic or a Jewish person or someone of another faith on a court? ... There would be no Protestants on the Supreme Court. Does that matter? Does there need to be another woman on the court? Should there be some other group represented?\"\n\nOn the recent health care reform bill, Clinton said he felt like \"Teddy Roosevelt would have felt if he'd still been alive in the 1930s seeing his cousin Franklin being able to sign legislation in areas that he had advocated.\"\n\nClinton was thrilled that it passed and that he and Hillary Clinton personally lobbied for passage before the final vote on the bill.\n\n\"She and I were ecstatic,\" he said.\n\nClinton expects more changes in the bill.\n\n\"They'll have to keep working on it and putting more cost drivers in it to take the cost down,\" he said. \"But it's a big, big step. And it's a wonderful thing for the country.\"\n\nMidterm Elections: Another 1994?\n\nClinton said the current political environment reminds him \"a little bit\" of 1994, a year in which Democrats lost majorities in both houses of Congress in a Republican landslide.\n\n\"I think that the dissent is just as intense, if not more intense,\" he said. \"But I think the outcome of the election is likely to be far less dramatic than it was in '94.\"\n\nClinton expects Republicans to make some gains, but \"I don't think they'll win either house.\"\n\nBack in 1994, congressional Democrats put their jobs on the line to vote for President Clinton's economic package. The recent health care vote, he said, was similar, but the country is different now.\n\n\"We are culturally a different country,\" he said. \"We are more diverse. We're more communitarian. That is, we understand we have to solve a lot of these problems together.\"\n\nClinton said he was reluctant to offer public advice to President Obama regarding the Middle East peace process, so as not to foreclose his options.\n\nBut he added, \"We need to do something to deprive both sides of any excuse not to engage in serious negotiations.\"\n\nIf President Obama puts a peace plan on the table, Clinton said he will \"strongly support it.\"\n\nThe argument against the administration putting forward a peace plan, Clinton said, is that the current Israeli government \"almost certainly would reject it.\" That, he said, could \"make us look weak.\"\n\nBut the Obama administration, Clinton said, \"may decide it's more important to have clarity and to do something that will be an action-forcing event to put them back to the table.\"",

    "text":"Mitt Romney came to coal country on Aug. 14, standing before a crowd of miners in eastern Ohio and pledging to fight for their jobs.\n\n\n\nYou could be forgiven if you thought this was much ado about 3,150 jobs -- the number employed directly by coal operations in Ohio, at least before two mines announced layoffs recently. But Romney\u2019s greater point was about how coal fires so many power plants in Ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration threatens jobs at those plants, too. This could drive up the cost of electricity for every Ohioan, Romney said.\n\n\n\nThis debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldn\u2019t play -- has been building for years. And after the event, the Obama campaign had a response, saying that Romney\u2019s position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\"Immediately after becoming governor, Romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people,\" said an Obama campaign news release.\n\nThe claim was similar to one the Obama team made in a radio ad, and Obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes Romney made in February, 2003, when Romney was the freshly elected governor of Massachusetts.\n\nThe quotes:\n\n\"That plant kills people.\" This was in reference to the Salem Harbor power plant, in the Boston area.\n\n\"I will not create jobs that kill people.\" This, too, was made by Romney outside the Salem Harbor plant.\n\nThe Obama campaign also highlighted a Romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong. It came from a state of Massachusetts news releasein which Romney said: \"If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health.\"\n\n\n\nRomney made each of these statements during a Feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.\n\n\n\nMassachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the \"Filthy Five\" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.\n\n\n\nAs occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor\u2019s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.\n\n\n\nBut the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. In the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of Massachusetts quoted Romney in the third person on the danger factor:\n\n\n\n\"Romney said that the Salem Harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year. He also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.\"\n\n\n\nThis was in a news release issued by the governor\u2019s aides, not some radical outside instigator. It was issued under the name of Romney, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and Romney\u2019s development chief, Douglas Foy. According to the Boston Globe, Romney hired Foy from the Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, a leading environmental advocacy group in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nThe spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange that February day after Salem Harbor\u2019s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts\u2019 emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. His statements that day show how he felt: \"That plant kills people.\" And to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: \"I will not create jobs that kill people.\"\n\n\n\nBased on some of the quotes, it might appear that Romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, Dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there). That\u2019s what we thought when we began looking into this. It is also what the Romney campaign told us in email.\n\n\n\nSo was it accurate for the Obama campaign to imply that Romney\u2019s words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor?\n\n\n\nWe kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim. And the news release under Romney\u2019s name suggested it as well.\n\n\n\nRomney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.\n\n\n\nStill, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the Salem Harbor plant? Wasn\u2019t that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today?\n\n\n\nNo, say environmentalists who include authorities from the CLF.\n\n\n\nTheir claims are supported by U.S. EPA emissions data we verified independently.\n\n\n\n\"When he said that \u2018this plant kills people,\u2019 he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the Midwest,\" said Seth Kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation.\n\n\n\nJonathan Peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the CLF and was recently chairman of the American Bar Association\u2019s air quality committee, added in a separate interview with PolitiFact Ohio that Romney promoted Massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the U.S. EPA wants to enforce -- and that Romney now criticizes.\n\n\n\n\"The levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the EPA has proposed,\" Kaplan agreed. \"He was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked.\"\n\n\n\nTo see if this was accurate -- that the emissions Romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the EPA (whose rules Romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that Massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at Salem Harbor and in the Midwest. The U.S. EPA keeps the information in its extensive Clean Air Markets database.\n\n\n\nNitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog. Sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said Jonathan Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.\n\n\n\nThe level of both these substances was multiple times lower at Salem Harbor, even when Romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at Eastlake in Northeast Ohio and several other Ohio plants we checked. Our comparisons included multiple years, including Salem Harbor in 2003 with Ohio plants in 2011. To compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour. The pattern held.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in Ohio,\" Walke said.\n\n\n\nYou might ask why we looked at Eastlake. It\u2019s because FirstEnergy Corp. plans to shut down two of that plant\u2019s boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with EPA rules. This is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although Romney did not mention it specifically.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the FirstEnergy shutdowns. New EPA rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in Eastlake. The tougher limits won\u2019t take effect until 2014. The EPA aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent.\n\n\n\nBut as the Massachusetts governor, Romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too. In 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. With Romney\u2019s name on the letterhead, Massachusetts in May, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule. Among them:\n\n\n\n\"First, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercury's harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children. Recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination.\"\n\n\n\nRomney was \"a champion\" of those mercury regulations, said Shanna Cleveland, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. \"He was one of the reasons we got them through.\"\n\n\n\nTime to clean up: Romney was discussing a specific power plant, Salem Harbor, when he said, \"That plant kills people.\" But the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced.\n\n\n\nAnd the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many cases lower, than at Midwest plants that he would now wants left alone, citing the use of affordable and abundant coal.\n\n\n\nIf one were to have supported the regulations Romney wanted in 2003, it\u2019s fairly safe to assume that \"one would also support such things nationally,\" said Jonathan Levy, an environmental scientist at Boston University and Harvard and co-author of the now heavily replicated study on the correlation between coal-burning power plants and respiratory health.\n\n\n\nThe Obama campaign claimed that as governor, Romney condemned coal plants as killers. He spoke at times of a single plant, but at other times made clear that other plants also needed to cut emissions for the sake of public health. This even included new rules for mercury reductions -- the same substance from coal plants that now is prompting closures in Ohio.\n\n\n\nThe debate over coal involves calculations of costs, the abundance or scarcity of natural resources, health and environmental risks, and attitudes about government regulation. It is not our role to say Romney was right or wrong at one time.\n\n\n\nBut with additional information from emissions data, interviews and the public record of his governorship, the Obama campaign claim about Romney\u2019s coal position of nine years ago is nearly as clear as a haze-free day.\n\n\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, it rates Mostly True.",

    "text":"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has welcomed news of the arrival in the United States this week of the 10,000th refugee from the conflict in Syria, and calls for greater global solidarity ahead of summits next month that will look at ways to increase efforts to deal with the unprecedented refugee crisis worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe United States has long been a leader in welcoming people fleeing global persecution and the arrival on Monday of the 10,000th Syrian refugee is a further expression of this leadership,\u201d said UNHCR Regional Representative in the United States, Shelly Pitterman.\n\n\u201cWe thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the world\u2019s largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines.\n\nTo aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement \u2013 close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally.\n\nUNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities.\n\nUNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission.\n\n\u201cResettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide,\u201d said Pitterman.",

    "text":"Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back:\n\n\"Well, let's talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated \u2014 forced \u2014 them to get health care.\"\n\nBefore jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common.\n\nOne of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like.\n\nObama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.\n\nObama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor \u2014 and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later.\n\nSo is it fair for Obama to call his plan \"universal\"? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it. We rate his claim Barely True.",

    "text":"At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small\u2014just 6 ft. long\u2014a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.\n\nIt was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and\u2014boom\u2014obliterated it. \"It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,\" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.\n\nFor China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. \"The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,\" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. \"China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there.\" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of anti\u00c2\u00adsatellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.\n\nMore From Popular Mechanics play icon The triangle icon that indicates to play\n\nINTERNATIONAL THREAT\n\nFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. \"Space debris is a huge problem,\" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed.\" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.\n\nAlthough the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials\u2014reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance\u2014chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.\n\nBattlefield: Space Media Platforms Design Team\n\n1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.\n\n2] Experts believe a four-stage, solid\u00c2\u00ad-fuel launch vehicle\u2014thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2\u2014boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.\n\n3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.\n\n4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.\n\n5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.\n\nSome details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nAMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS\n\nEvery industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.\n\nSome satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft -- including spy sats -- are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile -- yet it can be done. \"You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,\" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. \"You'd need ICBM-size boosters -- hundreds of them.\"\n\nSuch an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. \"There'd be so much debris up there,\" Clark says, \"that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. \"The consensus,\" Clark says, \"was that anybody could look at anybody else.\"\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nDiagram: China's antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites -- roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.\n\nTo develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.\n\nOver the next several decades the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985 the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was cancelled before the air-launched system could be perfected.\n\nThat same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.\n\nSome $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle -- a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested, and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.\n\nDestroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at Global\u00c2\u00adSecurity says, \"It's an act of war.\"\n\nU.S. Sat Kill Arsenal\n\n--Davin Coburn\n\n1] Perhaps the most spectacular test -- known as Starfish Prime -- occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.\n\n2] The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985, when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\n3] In 1997 the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy, and eventually canceled the program.\n\n4] The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat -- but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nSENDING A MESSAGE\n\nSo why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. \"The experiment is not targeted at any other country,\" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.\n\nSome experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that \"The United States considers space capabilities ... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so ... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.\"\n\nThe United States \"basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,\" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: \"Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.\"\n\nIn that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. \"The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.\"\n\nPike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.\n\n\"The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,\" Pike says. \"Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time.\" A half-dozen sats, Pike says -- that's all it would take. \"Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nIn that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its own war plan is feasible.\n\nAMERICA'S TRUMP CARD\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. \"It was a mistake,\" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, \"It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,\" Vick says. \"It is a threat, and the test showed that.\" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat and China has only 60 satellites -- few of these are worth shooting down.\n\nAmerica's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all -- they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, \"just nothing to shoot at.\"\n\nFor now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.\n\nWaste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.\n\nJULY 2007 The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.\n\nJANUARY 2008 A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.\n\nIt's called the Kessler Syndrome -- the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. \"Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,\" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know.\" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles -- and Kessler's looming threat. -- Erin McCarthy\n\nSource: Analysis courtesy of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation\/Analytical Graphics, Inc. Data as of April 26, 2007. Objects greatly magnified for visibility.\n\nLitter Kings Sad to say, but some space junk -- such as spent boosters -- simply comes with the territory. Other flotsam results from indifference or lousy planning, such as the bags of garbage Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned from the MIR space station for 15 years. Here's how the three busiest space players stack up.\n\nUnited States: Topping the list, most U.S. space junk comes from the upper stages of sat launch vehicles.\n\nRussia: The relatively low ratio of debris to satellites will soon change: The explosion of a Russian rocket over Australia in February appears to have produced approximately 1200 pieces of fresh debris.\n\nChina: Its January sat kill made it the top space polluter per satellite. \"Almost 85 percent of that debris will be in orbit in 100 years,\" says Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"It shows how badly they messed things up with one event.\" -- E.M.",

    "text":"During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a small group of wealthy contributors what he truly thinks of all the voters who support President Barack Obama. He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who don\u2019t assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied:\n\nThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that\u2019s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what\u2026These are people who pay no income tax.\n\nRomney went on: \u201c[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d\n\nMother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiser\u2014where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public\u2014and has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and we\u2019ve removed the blurring from the video. See the original blurred videos here.]\n\nHere is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president:\n\nAt the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, \u201cHad he been born of Mexican parents, I\u2019d have a better shot of winning this.\u201d Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, \u201cI have inherited nothing.\u201d He remarked, \u201cThere is a perception, \u2018Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.\u2019 Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.\u201d\n\nRomney told the contributors that \u201cwomen are open to supporting me,\u201d but that \u201cwe are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we\u2019re in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.\u201d When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, \u201cFrankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.\u201d He added, \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m either tied or close to the president\u2026that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\nAsked why he wouldn\u2019t go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:\n\nWe speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told you\u2014the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side\u2014they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, \u201cDo you think Barack Obama is a failure?\u201d they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, \u201cAre you disappointed that his policies haven\u2019t worked?\u201d they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don\u2019t want to be told that they were wrong, that he\u2019s a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he\u2019s corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn\u2019t up to the task. They love the phrase that he\u2019s \u201cover his head.\u201d But if we\u2019re\u2014but we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don\u2019t agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he\u2019d keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn\u2019t been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can\u2019t get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won\u2019t graduate from high school. What\u2019re they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d What he\u2019s going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone who\u2019s been successful, or who\u2019s, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work.\n\n(Note: Obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.)\n\nTo assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:\n\nI have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world. I didn\u2019t realize it. These guys in the US\u2014the Karl Rove equivalents\u2014they do races all over the world: in Armenia, in Africa, in Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I\u2019d tell them to you, but I\u2019d have to shoot you.\n\nWhen one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasn\u2019t attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:\n\nWell, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don\u2019t think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact\u2026My dad used to say, \u201cBeing right early is not good in politics.\u201d And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subject\u2014discussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesn\u2019t win elections. And there are, there are, there are\u2014for instance, this president won because of \u201chope and change.\u201d\n\nRomney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:\n\nThey\u2019ll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I\u2019m going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the president\u2019s going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets you\u2019re talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country.

With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who don\u2019t contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.\n\nALSO READ: More from the secret Romney video.

    "text":"Feb. 4, 2011 \u2014 -- In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the newly released House GOP budget, saying it falls far short of what needs to be done to deal with the federal deficit.\n\n\"It's really not going to touch the problem,\" Paul said. \"There's a disconnect between Republicans who want a balanced budget but aren't maybe yet brave enough to talk about the cuts to come.\"\n\nThe plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released on Thursday, would cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of fiscal year 2011, which ends on Sept. 30.\n\nIn an far-ranging interview aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul embraced the label \"true believer\" and said staying true to the principles of the Tea Party movement is more important to him than being a Republican. He also refused to rule out a future run for president and suggested it may be time to reduce U.S. force levels in Afghanistan.\n\nPaul has proposed his own plan to cut spending by $500 billion this year. Paul's plan would impose deep across-the-board spending cuts -- including a reduction of 83 percent from the Department of Education, 6 percent from the Department of Defense and the elimination all foreign aid. He considers it just a start.\n\n\"I go to a tea party and you know what they say to me? It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?\" Paul said.\n\nPaul defended his call to end to all foreign aid -- including the $3 billion the U.S. gives to Israel every year.\n\n\"I'm not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel,\" Paul said, \"but not with money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries even if they are our friends.\"\n\nPaul has come under fire from supporters of Israel, but said Israel has enough financial resources to fend for itself.\n\n\"I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world,\" Paul said. \"Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so.\"\n\nAnd military resources, as well.\n\n\"I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country,\" he said. \"I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies.\"\n\nRegarding Afghanistan, Paul said it is up to the president to determine troop levels, but, \"I personally think you can have a much smaller presence.\"\n\nAs for his own political allegiances, Paul made it clear he is a Tea Party activist first and a Republican second.\n\n\"There are always problems in our nation's capitol that are more important than party affiliation and I will always believe that,\" Paul said. \"It's not necessarily Tea Party versus Republican Party, but I would say that if you ask me what's more important, tackling our nation's deficit, our nation's debt problems or being a Republican, I would say tackling the debt.\"",

    "text":"On Sept. 28, pastors from 20 states will give politically based sermons from the pulpit as part of a protest organized by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative legal-advocacy group. The protest will challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations \u2013 including churches and other religious groups \u2013 that are exempt from taxation. According to the Internal Revenue Code, religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF says that if its protest leads the Internal Revenue Service to penalize houses of worship for their pastors\u2019 political advocacy, ADF will bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties.\n\nTo discuss the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turns to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nRobert W. Tuttle, David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion, The George Washington University Law School\n\nInterviewer:\n\nJesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life\n\nQuestion & Answer\n\nBefore 1954, section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permitted nonprofit organizations to endorse political candidates while remaining exempt from federal income tax. But in 1954, the U.S. Congress amended this part of the code to say that a charitable organization loses its tax-exempt status if it intervenes in a political campaign. Why did Congress add this restriction?\n\nMany members of Congress, including Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator at the time, voted for the amendment because they were concerned about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents\u2019 political campaigns. But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we don\u2019t know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment.\n\nNotably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule\u2019s actual purpose has to do with political contributions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations. For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax. But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes. So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.\n\nWhy is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?\n\nThe ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand. As a result, if a church wanted to promote or oppose a particular political candidate, the church would be required to create a separate organization to do so. Although this separate organization would be exempt from taxes, contributors could not take a tax deduction for their donations to this organization.\n\nThe ADF believes that this restriction takes political activity out of the heart of a congregation\u2019s life. For example, a congregation that wanted to retain its tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) could not include political activity in its worship service unless the worship service was financed by a separate organization. Moreover, ADF believes that because IRS officials must examine the content of sermons or other religious messages to determine whether a church has improperly engaged in political advocacy, IRS enforcement of the rule entangles the government in the operation of religious organizations.\n\nIf ADF\u2019s protest leads to a constitutional challenge in court, what arguments might ADF make?\n\nThe ADF would almost certainly argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating religious organizations more strictly than their secular counterparts. Similarly, ADF will likely argue that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal statute that prohibits the federal government from imposing a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on a religious organization unless the government demonstrates that it must impose that burden to achieve a \u201ccompelling government interest.\u201d The ADF will also likely argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating speech on the basis of its content. Finally, ADF might also claim that IRS enforcement of the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause by requiring the IRS to scrutinize sermons or other religious messages, thus excessively entangling government and religion.\n\nHow might the government defend the 1954 amendment?\n\nThe government will likely defend the 1954 amendment by arguing that the rule does not violate congregations\u2019 rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA because the restriction treats religious organizations just like other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, the government would say, the restriction does not bar congregations from participating in campaigns; it only prohibits donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. Likewise, the government will likely argue, the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the restriction does not prohibit the congregations from making political statements; it only bars them from using tax-deductible donations to do so. Finally, in response to ADF\u2019s Establishment Clause argument, the government will likely argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion because the IRS does not need to evaluate a sermon\u2019s theological merit to determine whether the sermon promotes a politician.\n\nHow do you think a court might evaluate these arguments?\n\nIt\u2019s always difficult to predict how a court might decide a hypothetical case because a court\u2019s decision often turns on a case\u2019s particular facts. But past decisions give us a pretty good basis for guessing that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment\u2019s application to religious organizations.\n\nThe most relevant case on this issue is Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 1954 amendment\u2019s constitutionality. That case arose after a congregation advocated for a presidential candidate, prompting the IRS to revoke the congregation\u2019s 501(c)(3) status. The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. But the D.C. Circuit Court rejected both of these arguments on the ground that the congregation was still free to engage in political speech and activities.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court\u2019s reasoning in this case relied heavily on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990). In Regan, the high court held that 501(c)(3) status provides a monetary benefit to certain tax-exempt organizations because it allows their donors to take a tax deduction for contributions. Therefore, the court concluded, the 1954 amendment does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the amendment merely withholds a speech subsidy rather than restricts speech.\n\nSimilarly, in the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries case, the Supreme Court held that a tax imposed equally on all organizations does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that although the tax may increase the cost of religious activity, the tax does not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise because it does not prevent religious organizations from engaging in religious activity.\n\nIf ADF challenged the 1954 amendment\u2019s application to religious organizations, I think it is very likely that a court would agree with the Branch Ministries decision and reject the challenge. In the years since the Regan and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries cases, there have been a number of important changes in free exercise and free speech law, but those changes have only reinforced these decisions.\n\nIf the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that raise a problem under the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause, which generally prohibits the government from favoring religion over nonreligion?\n\nThis is an even more difficult and complicated question than the previous one, and I could see a court going either way. On the one hand, courts usually uphold legislative efforts to relieve burdens on religious activity, even if those burdens are not so \u201csubstantial\u201d as to require an exemption under RFRA. So if Congress lifted the 1954 amendment, courts might be inclined to defer to the legislative judgment that the amendment should not apply to religious organizations.\n\nOn the other hand, courts might be more skeptical of such a religion-specific exemption from the 1954 amendment because this exemption would potentially provide religious organizations with a very significant benefit not extended to other charitable organizations. Indeed, if the 1954 amendment applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations except religious ones, those who contribute to congregations engaged in political activity would be allowed to take an income tax deduction for their contributions \u2013 thus offsetting some of the actual cost of the donation \u2013 while contributors to other political organizations would not be allowed to deduct their contributions. In other words, the government would effectively subsidize the political activities of congregations.\n\nSuch a subsidy raises serious questions under the Establishment Clause. In Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court held that a Texas law that exempted religious publications but not other publications from sales taxes violated the Establishment Clause because the exemption effectively subsidized religious publications. The court explained that although the government may alleviate special burdens on religious activity, the sales tax did not present such a special burden because it applied equally to both religious and nonreligious publications.\n\nSo the Texas Monthly decision strongly suggests that lifting the 1954 amendment only for religious organizations would violate the Establishment Clause. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the present Supreme Court would definitely find a constitutional violation if Congress lifted the restriction only for religious organizations. Indeed, because the present court has a much narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the court that decided Texas Monthly, the present court might be willing to overrule the Texas Monthly decision. The ADF is no doubt hoping that this will be the case. As I said, it\u2019s very difficult to guess how a court would decide this issue.",

    "text":"JUDY WOODRUFF: We come back now to the gun story.\n\nAnd we're joined by David Keene. He's president of the National Rifle Association.\n\nWelcome to the NewsHour.\n\nDAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.\n\nDAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.\n\nNo, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.\n\nNow, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at.\n\nAnd you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?\n\nAnd we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say that's what they're doing.\n\nDAVID KEENE: I know they do.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And let me just quickly read from something that Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded. Mark Kelly, her husband.\n\nThey wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: \"Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.\"\n\nAnd they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.\n\nDAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.\n\nMost people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.\n\nAnd she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.\n\nDAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?\n\nDAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.\n\nBut, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.\n\nIn our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.\n\nIt's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...\n\nDAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.\n\nBut, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.\n\nIt's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.\n\nBut we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.\n\nWhen you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keep databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.\n\nTwenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nDAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.\n\nMaybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...\n\nDAVID KEENE: Sure.\n\nWell, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they in fact train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.\n\nTheir crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.\n\nNow each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.\n\nAfter Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.\n\nNow, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.\n\nCan you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.\n\nWhy not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.\n\nSo, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.\n\nSo, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?\n\nDAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.\n\nBut, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.\n\nAnd one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.\n\nFine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, it is.\n\nAnd the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.\n\nWhen that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.\n\nBut, given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.\n\nBut when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.\n\nAnd that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.\n\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always. Thank you.",

    "text":"By Sen. Rand Paul\n\nVideos by Rare\n\nRumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.\n\nOne of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.\n\nWe liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.\n\nRELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to war\n\nMost importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.\n\nBolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years \u2014 particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.\n\nJohn Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.\n\nNone of this is secret. It\u2019s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.\n\nBolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. \u201cI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,\u201d Bolton said just last year.\n\nTrump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. \u201cIraq used to be no terrorists,\u201d Trump said in 2015. \u201c(N)ow it\u2019s the Harvard of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at Iraq from years ago, I\u2019m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,\u201d Trump said of Saddam Hussein, \u201cbut it was a lot better than it is right now.\u201d\n\nTrump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 \u201chelped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.\u201d In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.\n\nYou can\u2019t learn from mistakes if you don\u2019t see mistakes.\n\nTrump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS \u2014 but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.\n\nIn 2011, Bolton bashed Obama \u201cfor his refusal to directly target Gaddafi\u201d and declared, \u201cthere is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi\u2026 But Obama missed it.\u201d In fact, Obama actually took Bolton\u2019s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, \u201cWe came, we saw, he died.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied \u201c100 percent.\u201d Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.\n\nNo man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.\n\nAll nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn\u2019t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.\n\nWoodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, \u201cI hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.\u201d\n\nBolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that \u201che had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.\u201d But he\u2019s seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: \u201cEven before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives\u2019 war-and-conquest agenda,\u201d notes The American Conservative\u2019s Jon Utley.\n\nAt a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy.\n\nThe man is a menace.\n\nRELATED: Rand Paul says Republicans\u2019 top priority will be to repeal Obamacare\n\nOur Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war.\n\nThe true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.\n\nRand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.",

    "text":"Rose Garden\n\n5:35 P.M. EDT\n\nMR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.\n\nIn our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.\n\nWhat happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.\n\nAnd that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.\n\nExpanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with \u201cA\u201d ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It\u2018s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n\nWe'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.\n\nWe take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.\n\nOn behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.\n\nAnd I would like to thank Connecticut\u2019s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They\u2019ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.\n\nWe will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.\n\nWe leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.\n\nThank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who\u2019s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers \u2013- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.\n\nFamilies that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders \u2013- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We\u2019re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.\n\nAnd a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it\u2019s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.\n\nA majority of senators voted \u201cyes\u201d to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m going to speak plainly and honestly about what\u2019s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -\u2013 both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with \u201cA\u201d grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.\n\nAs they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.\n\nTheir legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she\u2019s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.\n\nIn fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn\u2019t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That\u2019s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.\n\nBut instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of \u201cbig brother\u201d gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they\u2019re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.\n\nBut the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn\u2019t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn\u2019t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.\n\nAnd obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn\u2019t prevent all future massacres. And that\u2019s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.\n\nAnd this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.\n\nI've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn\u2019t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?\n\nI've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. \"A prop,\" somebody called them. \u201cEmotional blackmail,\u201d some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don\u2019t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?\n\nSo all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.\n\nBut this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don\u2019t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We\u2019re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We\u2019re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We\u2019re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.\n\nBut we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.\n\nTo all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don\u2019t act this time, you will remember come election time.\n\nTo the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn\u2019t represent your views on this one.\n\nThe point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They\u2019ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n\nSo to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you\u2019ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.\n\nAnd that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they\u2019ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.\n\nAnd I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We\u2019re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.\n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming that the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who\u2019ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I\u2019m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I\u2019m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.\n\nI believe we\u2019re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND 5:55 P.M. EDT",

    "text":"The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.\n\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.\n\n\n\nAs it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.\n\n\n\nOn the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. \"Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?\" she asked.\n\n\n\nBrown responded, \"In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Walters asked him, \"Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?\" Brown said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"The whole plan?\" Walters continued.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Brown said.\n\n\n\nLater, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.\n\n\n\n\"That was the most evasive answer,\" Krugman said. \"If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.\"\n\n\n\nWe wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed \"the same thing\" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts.\n\n\n\nThe consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, \"Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.\"\n\n\n\nHere are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary \"exchanges\" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5 -to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans.\n\n\n\nThe bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (\"Cadillac\") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.\n\n\n\n\"The Senate probably has more cost containment,\" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. \"And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.\"\n\n\n\nSo it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.",

Ground zero: Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nABC's Bob Woodruff is there, and he joins me now with the verylatest. Good morning, Bob.\n\nWOODRUFF: Good morning, Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: So there have been six days of protests there so far,state employees fighting the proposed cuts to their benefits and theirunion's right to bargain, Democratic legislators hiding in order tostop a vote. Bob, what's driving the people that you've met there?Does it look like there's an end in sight?\n\nWOODRUFF: Well, that's a good question. You know, this has beenjust a huge event. The weather is now starting to change today. Theythink there might be about six inches of snow today. Hopefully that'sgoing to come to an end, as well.\n\nBut, really, the numbers are really impressive. You know, theynow estimate that about 68,000 people were here yesterday. Most ofthem were teacher union members. But also then, for the first timeyesterday, the Tea Party supporters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWOODRUFF (voice-over): Is this what the future of Americanpolitics looks like?\n\n(UNKNOWN): I don't think we've ever had anything like this.\n\n(UNKNOWN): This is unprecedented for -- for our times. WOODRUFF: In Madison, the capitol building is still swellingwith protesters, a near total takeover. Tens of thousands in thestreets, too, determined to thwart a bill they see as a frontalassault on public labor unions.\n\n(UNKNOWN): What's disgusting?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Union busting.\n\n(UNKNOWN): What's disgusting?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Union busting.\n\n(UNKNOWN): How do you get better teachable moments than this?If you don't like what somebody's doing, we don't just sit back and --and watch. We don't wait four years for the next budget or electioncycle. We tell them right away we don't like it.\n\nWOODRUFF: The protesters are furious with Governor ScottWalker's plan to drastically curtail the bargaining power of theirunions. Outraged public workers and their allies have dominated thescene here since last Monday. But for the first time this weekend,they had company.\n\n(on-screen): Really what this is, is a tale of two rallies.You've got the one side, the union on this side, and then you come onover here to the Tea Party. So on one side, you've got kill the bill.On the other side, you've got pass the bill.\n\n(voice-over): The crowd supporting the governor, smaller in sizebut not in conviction, came from around the state to deliver a clearmessage.\n\n(UNKNOWN): But we're not going to negotiate. Why would wenegotiate? We won -- we won in November. Elections haveconsequences. That's -- it's as simple as that. I can't make it anyplainer. We won; they lost. That's what's going to happen. The billis going to be passed.\n\nWOODRUFF: We met Lou Debraccio (ph) early in the morning, 110miles away from the capitol, as he and a clutch of fellow Tea Partysupporters boarded a bus bound for Madison. Debraccio (ph) is a smallgovernment conservative, eager for his voice to be heard in thedebate.\n\nDEBRACCIO (ph): I want to -- I want to see the state moveforward. And in order to do that, many of us in the private sectorhave had to sacrifice and I think necessary that -- that we all sharethat sacrifice. It does hit home for me. My wife is a teacher. It'sgoing to cost our family money. But it's the right thing to do, so Isupport it.\n\nWOODRUFF: While Debraccio (ph) was heading to town, chemistryteacher Anthony Schnell (ph) and his family were deep in their morningroutine. J. SCHNELL: The immediate effect to our family is that we willmake about $500 a month less on Anthony's paycheck. And we are justhanging on by our fingernails right now. My husband loves being ateacher. He's tried other things, and he loves education, he loveskids, he loves working with families. And for him to say I think Imight have to leave this again is just heart-breaking, because it'shis passion.\n\nA. SCHNELL: This isn't about the money. It's not about thebenefits. Of course, that's going to hit us, and we don't like that.But it's really about having input in the classes, you know, havinginput with the school board, having input with what happens.\n\nWOODRUFF: Anthony's been coming to the protests all week, butthe Tea Party's presence weighed on his mind as he approached thecapitol.\n\nA. SCHNELL: I'm a little nervous about today. I just don't knowwhat's going happen.\n\nWOODRUFF: Once inside the rotunda, he lost the butterflies andbegan working the crowd.\n\nA. SCHNELL: Is this a budget fight?\n\nCROWD: No.\n\nA. SCHNELL: Is this just about money?\n\nCROWD: No.\n\nA. SCHNELL: Is this about us doing the best in our classrooms?\n\nCROWD: Yes.\n\nWOODRUFF (on-screen): They're all saying this is huge. And ifit happens here, it's going to happen everywhere in the rest of thecountry.\n\n(voice-over): In the rotunda, there is now a flavor of a '60s-era sit-in. In fact, some told us it's the biggest demonstrationthey've seen here since the Vietnam War.\n\n(on-screen): You doing this every day until this thing -- thisbill is killed?\n\nOWEN: I think this is going to happen every day until this billis killed. I don't think there's any way that the people in thisbuilding are going to give up the right to collective bargaining.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I'm here because this is wrong, that this sort ofshotgun legislation, ramming it through, it's the wrong way to dealwith problems. This isn't about me. It's about trying to do the bestwe can for society and communities.\n\nWOODRUFF: Do you think it's going to be peaceful? (UNKNOWN): I think so. I think the tensions are going to behigh, but I think it's going to stay civil.\n\nWOODRUFF: But what if this...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Well, wait. Not civil, it's going to stay peaceful.\n\nWOODRUFF: Lou Debraccio (ph) got an earful from the pro-laborcrowd as he made his way to the Tea Party demonstration.\n\nDEBRACCIO (ph): I'm not going to change any of their minds.They're committed enough to drive here and make signs, just likethey're not going to change my mind. It's not about that. So there'slimited return in talking to them.\n\nWOODRUFF: Even some families are divided. Julie Hansen (ph)supports the governor. Her 13-year-old daughter does not.\n\nHANSEN (ph): My 13-year-old is for collective bargaining. Shewent to school yesterday, and the teachers spoke to her about it.\n\nWOODRUFF: Think she believes it and -- or just because of theone lesson from the teacher?\n\nHANSEN (ph): We had a pretty adamant discussion.\n\nWOODRUFF (voice-over): Jeff Strobel (ph) is here with the TeaParty. His brother-in-law is on the other side.\n\nSTROBEL (ph): And my brother-in-law is a union worker. We had abig e-mail exchange on Facebook last night. The best thing is, it wascivil, it was, you know, courteous. But we kind of tried to educateeach other, but we're never going to agree. He's on this side; I'm onthis side. But we can talk about it.\n\nWOODRUFF (on-screen): Still going to have a peaceful Christmasdinner together?\n\nSTROBEL (ph): As long as there's beer there, we'll be peaceful.\n\nWOODRUFF (voice-over): Late Saturday, the governor issued astatement, turning down a compromise offer from the unions. And sohere in Wisconsin, the standoff continues, for now.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" I'm Bob Woodruff in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And so is Wisconsin just the beginning? States fromcoast to coast are grappling with this fundamental question: Indesperate economic times, which Americans should sacrifice the most?I'll put that to the roundtable coming up next.\n\nAnd later, revolt in the Middle East engulfs more of America'sstrongest allies, with the Obama administration struggling to stayahead of events. I'll get an exclusive progress report from Secretaryof State Hillary Clinton.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Some of what I've heard coming out of Wisconsin, whereyou're just making it harder for public employees to collectivelybargain generally, seems like more of an assault on unions. And Ithink it's very important for us to understand that public employees,they're our neighbors, they're our friends. They make a lot ofsacrifices and make a big contribution. And I think it's importantnot to vilify them or to suggest that somehow all these budgetproblems are due to public employees.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: President Obama igniting a national conversation aboutwhich Americans should feel the pain of the budget axe. With pitchedbattles going on right now here in Washington and in statehouses fromFlorida to Wisconsin to California, with me now, our roundtable,George Will, Congressman Steve Southerland, a Republican freshman fromFlorida, he was elected to public office for the very first time lastNovember and sent here to Washington on a mission to cut spending.Also with us, ABC senior political correspondent Jonathan Karl andpolitical strategist Donna Brazile, who calls herself a laborDemocrat.\n\nThank you all for being here. So, George, Wisconsin. Is thisthe sort of battle that we're going to see shaping up around thecountry? Is this really the sort of political and philosophicaldebate that's going on right now about what these cuts are going tomean?\n\nWILL: It would have been even if the president hadn'tintervened. But in the span of three days, Christiane, he firstsubmits a budget that would increase the federal deficit and, two dayslater, he mobilizes his party, his own political machine, andorganized labor, which is an appendage to his party, to sabotageWisconsin's attempt to do what he will not do, which is deal with theinsolvency of their government. In doing so, he has set the stage for2012 by saying the Democratic Party is the party of government, notjust in having an exaggerated view of the scope and competence ofgovernment, but because its base is in public employees.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, Donna, mobilizing his troops, sabotaging theeffort to cut the budget, he did use the word \"assault,\" thepresident. Is that too much? I mean, what is going on here? BRAZILE: Well, first of all, they're entering day seven of theprotests. And my recollection is that President Obama commented on itin day four of the protest. So the fact is, is that this is agrassroots movement that had nothing to do with people or politiciansin Washington, D.C. This has everything to do with the workers therein Wisconsin and all across the country who are feeling the effects ofthese draconian budget cuts.\n\nLook, state and local workers have taken the brunt of a lot ofthese cuts. And they're willing to come to the table to talk to thegovernor to put forward more wage cuts, more pension -- pay up moremoney for their pension, more for their health care. Why won't thegovernment sit down with them? That's all they want. They want thegovernor to sit down with them, to talk about these items, but theywant their collective bargaining right, their voice at the tableremoved from the discussion.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is this a defining moment for -- for the labormovement?\n\nBRAZILE: Absolutely. Look, union membership is at an all-timelow over the previous 20-year high. This is an assault on workersacross the country. And people believe that they're using thepretense of a budget battle to destroy collective bargaining rights.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, Representative Southerland, a freshman to thisprocess, is this about fiscal responsibility? Or what is happening?Because it's happening in your state, as well.\n\nSOUTHERLAND: It is. And as you know, with nearly all of thestates requiring a balanced budget amendment, they don't have anychoice. The governors have to balance their budget. I know our owngovernor, Governor Scott, we see similar measures being taken in thestate of Florida.\n\nAnd I think you're seeing this in New Jersey, you're seeing thisin Wisconsin, so I think that, because they're bound by that limit ofa balanced budget -- which I am in favor of at the federal level -- Ithink that you're going to see this around the country.\n\nYou -- look, the American family is learning they have to do morewith less. And the same expectation, I think, is fair of thegovernments, both state and federal.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Jon, is it just about the budget? Or is Madison,Wisconsin, have a bigger political implication?\n\nKARL: Oh, it clearly has a bigger political implication. Look,the president was quicker and more forceful in his denouncement ofGovernor Scott Walker than he was of in denouncing Hosni Mubarak. Imean, this happened, it was more forceful, it was quicker.\n\nMadison, Wisconsin, the state of Wisconsin, this is arguablyground zero for the 2012 presidential campaign. Look, this is a statethat if President Obama loses, he almost certainly is going to not winre-election. This is a state that's been solidly Democratic and(inaudible) more in the direction of Republicans, a bigger move thanany other state in 2010.\n\nI mean, look what happened. You saw the Republicans capture thegovernorship, capture the state legislature, two House seats, a Senateseat, and, you know, Democrats see the momentum and see real dangersigns for next year.\n\nWILL: Governor Walker was elected promising to do what he'sdoing. He did the same thing as county executive in Milwaukee, wherehe was -- there were protests, union uprisings, and he was handily re-elected.\n\nDonna, as I'm sure you know, such heroes of the labor movement asFranklin Roosevelt and Fiorello La Guardia said there's no place inthe public sector for unionization at all. As I'm sure you know, 24states limit or deny entirely collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions. And all Mr. Scott is planning to do is limitcollective bargaining to wages. What is draconian about that?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, what these workers would like, George, sincethey've already given up furloughs, paid leave, unpaid leave, whatthey would like is -- is to have a voice at the table. They don'twant their collective bargaining rights.\n\nAnd, look, what we're talking about is that the governor hascherry-picked what public workers he will subject to this so-calledremoval of their collective bargaining rights. The firefighters, thepolicemen and others who supported him in his election bid, well,guess what? They don't have to worry about their collectivebargaining rights.\n\nChristiane, over 400,000 state and local employees have losttheir jobs over -- during the -- the duration of the recession. Theyare willing -- what we've seen across the country is, these workersare willing to come to the table to talk to these governors aboutreducing the -- the budget deficit, but not on the backs of workingpeople.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you, because you brought up, George, whenthe governor was the county executive in Milwaukee. And there's aninteresting story today. It -- it boils down, perhaps, as some mightsay, to sort of shared sacrifice. Where is the sacrifice going to beborne the most? And is it equitable?\n\nI just want to ask you, you know, the articles talks about thelayoffs that the governor had announced back then, in 2003, quote,\"decimated\" the country's public parks, the staff, reduced the numberof county social workers, correction officers, janitors. As a result,park bathrooms shuttered, pools closed, and trash piled up so high. Imean, does it get to a point where too much is too much or not?\n\nWILL: And he's re-elected.\n\nAMANPOUR: That was my next question.\n\nWILL: The public liked what he did.\n\nAMANPOUR: OK. All right, well, that's the answer.\n\nBRAZILE: They liked what he did in one county. But what you seetoday is an organic movement. Just like the Tea Party went out thereand grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people outthere saying, \"No more,\" no more budget cuts on the back of workingpeople. The governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations. Iknow he campaigned on that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: ... but people like Representative Southerland camehere to -- to make those massive cuts.\n\nSOUTHERLAND: And -- and let me say this about working people.You know, that's not just federal employees. I mean, I come from asmall business, and 40 percent of the jobs lost in this recession camefrom small business, which makes up 85 percent of our economy.\n\nSo, you know, and I look at the retirement benefits and thebenefit packages that most small businesses offer to their employees,and they pale in comparison to -- to many of the federal programs thatfederal employees have the benefit of. So, you know, I think manypeople that work in small businesses are depending upon their SocialSecurity as their retirement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: Donna, what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority ofthis tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government.Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work --while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it's allabout the kids, they're abandoning their classrooms, lying to theirsupervisors, saying they were sick, and going off to protest indefense of perquisites, which if the governor cuts them as much as heplans to do, would still leave them better off than their privatesector...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: But why should workers bear the brunt of thisrecession? Why are we scapegoating just public-sector employees when,in fact, the -- the folks on Wall Street and others who caused thisrecession, George, they're enjoying huge bonuses. Bankers are notlending to small businesses, which is why we're not creating the kindof jobs that we need. But we're trying to balance the budgets on thebacks of the poor and the middle class, and that's why workers arestanding up for their rights.\n\nAMANPOUR: And do you think, though, that as some have said thisis just an opportunity for union-busting?\n\nSOUTHERLAND: Well, you know, I'm not sure if -- if that is -- ifthat is the focus.\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, some are saying that. But do you think...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSOUTHERLAND: I want to say something about, you know, Donna'scomments.\n\nBRAZILE: Now, remember, you're a freshman.\n\nSOUTHERLAND: I remember. I remember. But let me say this...\n\nBRAZILE: And I'm your first woman on national TV, other thanChristiane. Now, be careful.\n\nSOUTHERLAND: But I'm not a freshman at -- at -- at running oursmall business. And you talk about bankers lending. You know,community banks are being hammered, you know, because they're comingin, they're being taken over. They -- they can't -- they can't loanmoney, OK? You can't get appraisals. You look at the thrift and howthey're coming in and capturing the small banks, and the small banksin our communities are -- are -- are critical to the flavor of ourcommunities. We can't get capital. So I think -- and that's aregulation issue.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: ... Congress should address.\n\nKARL: But, clearly -- clearly, what Walker is going...\n\nSOUTHERLAND: I think we will.\n\nKARL: I mean, Walker is going right at the public employeeunions. And part of it's because of that experience he had in 2003.He has said that he wouldn't have had to make all those cuts if hecould have gotten a better deal with concessions.\n\nAMANPOUR: And it's not just Republican governors. It's -- it'ssome Democrats, as well. Mario Cuomo and others are having to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: But one of the things he's doing is he's saying...\n\nBRAZILE: Andrew. Andrew.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: Yeah, don't do that. One of the things that he's doing issaying that no longer will union dues be automatically taken out ofpublic employee paychecks, so the unions would have to go out andcollect those dues. This is something that's going right at the heartnot necessarily of the union employees, but the union leadership.\n\nBRAZILE: But the unions want to come to the table.\n\nWILL: Because they know what happens.\n\nBRAZILE: They want to come to the table, George. They've got 12percent. They say, here, we want to contribute 12 percent. We wantto give you $30 billion for this fiscal year, which ends on June 30th,and over the next two years, $300 million in concessions. Now, youdon't walk away from the table or you don't come to the bargainingtable when labor is ready to negotiate.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. We're going to continue this after abreak. Tea Party revolutionaries on Capitol Hill, Washington bracesfor a possible government shutdown. The big question: Which sidewill blink first?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBOEHNER: Our goal here is to cut spending. When we say we'regoing to cut spending, read my lips: We're going to cut spending.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: House Speaker John Boehner drawing a line in the sand.And sure enough, yesterday the House, with its Tea Party-poweredfreshmen, passed the biggest spending cut in modern American history.\n\nBut now it goes to the Democrat-controlled Senate, and it sets upan epic clash of ideas over how to solve a massive budget crisis. Andit sets the stage for a possible government shutdown.\n\nJoining me once again, George Will, Congressman Steve Southerlandof Florida, a conservative freshman elected with Tea Party support,Jonathan Karl, and Donna Brazile.\n\nSo, you're a man on Capitol Hill. This was the first shot inthis big battle over -- over spending cuts. And, really, people likeCongressman Southerland showed their muscle.\n\nKARL: This is the Tea Party's moment. I mean, imagine this. Weare talking not only about cutting government spending -- Washingtonhas never really done that -- but we're talking about how much.\n\nI mean, even the Democrats -- even Nancy Pelosi came out with --with a measure that would continue government funding temporarily,freezing it at last year's level. That is what Democratstraditionally would call a cut, because you're not going withinflation. So this is -- this is really a moment. This is also theChris Christie phenomenon. Will politicians be rewarded for makingtough choices, again, something I don't think we've ever seen happen?\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you care about being rewarded about tough choices?\n\nSOUTHERLAND: Well, I think the American people are ready. Theyrecognize the brutal reality that we're broke. And -- and -- andyou're seeing that. We just talked in the last segment about thestate level, and it certainly applies here.\n\nWe've seen record deficits. And the budget that the president,you know, introduced this past week just continues to put the pedal tothe metal. So, I mean, we're talking about this year alone, we're ata $1.5 trillion deficit. And, you know, we talk about draconianmeasures of the C.R., but that draconian is leaving our children withdebt that smothers them.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. But in the real world, what happens if thisdoesn't get past the Senate or past the president? Then what?\n\nSOUTHERLAND: Well, look, we -- I'm not -- I'm not naive to the-- to the fact that when it goes to the Senate, they're going to maketheir -- their changes, and then it's got to go to the president. So,you know, it will not be in the form that we produced yesterdaymorning at 5 a.m. when we left the House being on the floor all night.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you're prepared for maybe half that figure?\n\nSOUTHERLAND: Well, I'm interested. I'm eager to see what'sgoing to happen. I don't -- I don't know what's going to happen. ButI don't expect it's going to be in the same form that we producedyesterday morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: Where is this going, George? Everybody, of course,talks about government shutdown or not. Some do.\n\nWILL: Well, that's premature. The Democratic senators have todecide, as does the president, whether they want to spend the next twoyears blocking in the Senate or vetoing on the president's deskspending bills because they're too small, because they believe thegovernment isn't spending enough.\n\nThe Democratic senators have to decide if, out of a $15 trillioneconomy, the economy is going to be hurt by cutting $60 billion fromthe federal budget. They have to decide whether, out of a $3.7trillion budget, there isn't $60 billion of inessential spending.\n\nAMANPOUR: But it's still the hugest proposed cut. Who's goingto blink first, Donna? You've been briefed. And I know you've beentalking to -- to leadership about these matters.\n\nBRAZILE: This is very difficult. And we all recognize that wehave to begin to cut spending. As Jonathan mentioned, the HouseDemocrats, the Senate Democrats, the president has submitted a budget,the 2012 budget, that -- that will slow the rate of growth and bringdown the federal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2015. Yeah, PresidentObama has a little bit of fiscal conservativism in him.\n\nBut the point is, is that this is primal scream politics; $61billion at the current spending levels is draconian. It cutsessential, vital, necessary services.\n\nGeorge, it's people -- it's students who are in college right nowwith Pell Grants that will have to face significant cuts. It's --it's preschoolers in Head Start that may not be able to go to schoolon the morning after May 4th, if we don't continue with the continuingresolution at 2010 levels.\n\nSo I think this is draconian. It's bad for the country. It'sbad for the economy. And it slows down economic growth at a time whenthings are finally moving up.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Jon, do you think it's going to lead to ashutdown?\n\nKARL: Well, it might. I think there's a real possibility ofthat. I can tell you this: John Boehner has been telling peopleprivately, his Republican colleagues, that he will not allow agovernment shutdown. But the question is, will he be able to -- youknow, to produce?\n\nHere's the time line, though, is -- is that they just did this.The House and the Senate are gone for the next week. They have fourdays when they get back to work out some kind of an agreement. And ifthey don't do it by the end of the four days, we are at a governmentshutdown.\n\nAMANPOUR: So what's going to happen? What sort of pressure --are you going to put on the speaker?\n\nSOUTHERLAND: Well, I think -- I think, the Republicans, we haveno desire to have a government shutdown. I think that Speaker Boehnerhas been very, very clear. I think that he wanted to produce a billthat was legitimate. We saw over the last five days -- we saw thefirst C.R. that went through open rules. We had over 500 amendments.We voted on 70. And it was amazing to see the process, to seeDemocrats voting with Republicans on amendments. I mean, the will ofthe floor...\n\nKARL: But are your colleagues going to go along with somethingthat doesn't cut spending?\n\nSOUTHERLAND: It's going have to cut spending.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: See, that's...\n\nSOUTHERLAND: Look, I -- I mean, we're going have to cutspending. I think...\n\nBRAZILE: But the appropriation chair came up with $30 billion inspending cuts. And then the House can -- the ultra-conservatives -- Ihave no other way of describing you -- you guys decided that youneeded $30 billion more.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: ... the politics of a shutdown, it sunk Newt Gingrich.Would it sink Speaker Boehner?\n\nWILL: It would do anyone any good on either side. But ourviewers can do the arithmetic. They can take $60 billion for $3.7trillion. And if that's draconian, what wouldn't be draconian?\n\nBRAZILE: But, George, we're talking about over the next sevenmonths. We've got -- we've got food safety workers that will beimpacted. We have people who will be impacted across the board.\n\nWILL: This budget includes $7,500 bribes for anyone who will buya Chevrolet Volt.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: ... will be...\n\nBRAZILE: ... the Metro. We're going to need to get the bicycleout, George.\n\nAMANPOUR: You can carry on your challenges in the green room,where the roundtable will continue.\n\nAnd we turn next to the Middle East, as people-poweredrevolutions sweeps the region. I ask Hillary Clinton what it meansfor the United States. My exclusive interview, when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: In the Middle East overnight, the popular uprisingsweeping the region have taken their most violent turn yet. Ithappened in Libya. Protesters there have been calling for the removalof the strong man, Moammar Gadhafi, for the last five days. He's beenin power for more than 40 years. And eyewitnesses are reporting thatthe military has now been firing on protesters after gaining theirconfidence and being welcomed into the crowd. A doctor gave adramatic radio interview. Let's listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): Oh, my god. They're firing on the civilians here.They're crazy. They're going crazy here.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: There are reports of hundreds dead and thousandsinjured in Libya.\n\nIn Yemen this morning, thousands marched again in the streets ofthe capital, Sana'a. The president, an important American ally in thewar on terror, blamed the unrest on a foreign plot.\n\nAnd in Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, whichprotects crucial oil-shipping lanes, demonstrators retook the squarewhere their calls for reform have now given way to calls for the kingto step down.\n\nBahrain, of course, is also a logistical hub and command centerfor U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And last night, in a180-degree turn, the crown prince offered to open up a dialogue withthe protesters. ABC's Miguel Marquez is there.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARQUEZ: Christiane, it is amazing, the difference that 24 hoursmakes. This time yesterday, this country appeared poised for civilwar; now it is a celebration down here at Pearl Square, as you cansee. And it appears we're headed for a negotiated politicalsettlement.\n\nIn order the get the settlement they want, these protesters arenow willing to stay for the long haul. You can see they've set uptents all the way around Pearl Square here. They're even serving foodout here. That tea, by the way, is called Freedom Tea, and they arevery organized. This area over here is the men's section. And thenright back here, all these people in black, that's the women'ssection.\n\nThe big question is, what will get these protesters to go home?They want a constitutional democracy. They want the king to back offof politics and become a figurehead. They want the prime minister,who's been in power for 40 years, to go home. But so much blood hasbeen spilled here in the past week, these protesters want asignificant deal. Will they get it? It's not clear. It's not clearwhat will get them to stop protesting, pack up their tents, and gohome.\n\nChristiane?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: And we'll keep watching Bahrain and the otheruprisings.\n\nPresident Obama has called Bahrain's king -- he did that onFriday -- urging him to respect the rights of the protesters. Theadministration once again finds itself in a bit of a bind, as freedomactivists face off against an authoritarian ally.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton walked a fine line when Ispoke to her exclusively on Friday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: Madame Secretary, thank you for joining us.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you for having me.\n\nAMANPOUR: About Bahrain.\n\nCLINTON: Uh-huh.\n\nAMANPOUR: How do you assess Bahrain right now? Is it stable?\n\nCLINTON: You know, Christiane, we've been very clear from thebeginning that we do not want to see any violence. We deplore it. Wethink it is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nWe very much want to see the human rights of the peopleprotected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves,and we want to see reform. And so Bahrain had started on some reform,and we want to see them get back to that as quickly as possible. AMANPOUR: What will the United States do? And will it holdBahrain to a similar standard, as it did Egypt?\n\nCLINTON: We -- we try to hold everyone to a similar standard,but we cannot dictate the outcomes. We cannot tell countries whatthey're going to do. We had, you know, no control over what happenedin Egypt.\n\nAMANPOUR: As Americans sit and watch and try to make sense ofwhat's going on in the Arab Muslim world, is what's happening -- isthe emerging new order, is it good for America? What should Americansmake of it?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think, in general, Americans are in favor ofhuman rights, freedom, democracy. We know that ultimately the mostprogress that can be made on behalf of human beings anywhere is whenthose individuals are empowered, when they have governments that areresponsive. That's what we want to see.\n\nAt the same time, we recognize that this process can be hijacked.It can be hijacked by both outside and inside elements within anycountry. I mean, what a tragedy to see what happened in Iran. Therewas a great deal of hope and pent-up feeling that the time had come in1979, and look at what Iran is doing today.\n\nAMANPOUR: You want democracy. You speak about democracy. Canyou control democracy? Should you control democracy? Or do you haveto take the chips and let them fall where they may if you wantdemocracy?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that, first, we have to start from thebasic premise as to what democracy means, and democracy is not oneelection that then whoever wins it decides never to have another one.\n\nThat is not what anyone wants. We want to work with those forceswithin societies that are yearning for change to make sure that theyhave the support needed and, frankly, the technical assistance, thefinancial assistance to be able to make it through to what is a goodoutcome, what they've asked for in their online blogs and in theirposters and in their interviews.\n\nAMANPOUR: I want to ask you this, because it's an in-depthinterview that you've done in Bazaar. It's a beautiful layout. I'mstruck by the imagery, though. You are there, beautiful, but in acorner.\n\nCLINTON: You know, I just do what photographers tell me to do.It has no metaphorical meaning for me.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAMANPOUR: But I wanted to ask you, do you feel in a corner rightnow or on a tight rope, trying to balance the need for stability incountries where you have allies and interests, and your values,wanting democracy and all the human rights for the people there? Isthat a struggle? CLINTON: Well, I think it is a challenge. And it is a challengenot only at this point of time in the Middle East; it is an inherentchallenge in diplomacy, in America's efforts in the world. We want toadvance our security, our values, and our interests. And if therewere one template that could be imposed on every situation, I wouldn'tneed to have this job, and nobody else would have to, either. Butthis is often a balancing act and...\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you feel you're at a turning point, at a sort of atectonic shift in trying to figure out where the balance is, whereyour strategic interests lie?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Christiane, we deal with, you know, so manycountries around the world, some of whom are closer to our values, whosee their interests in ways we do and some of who -- whom are on theopposite end of the spectrum.\n\nAMANPOUR: In the Middle East, America's strategic interests havebeen with some of these autocratic rulers. They've helped you withIsrael and peace in the region. They've helped you against terrorism.Do you believe that a democratic people could be a force for much morestability, longer-term stability?\n\nCLINTON: Well, ultimately, a really truly functioning,comprehensive democracy has historically been proven to be a greaterforce for stability. Navigating through what are difficult choicesfor societies that are doing that transition is something that theUnited States encourages, as we did after the fall of the Berlin Wall,and will continue to encourage. At the same...\n\nAMANPOUR: So here, will you be encouraging it here?\n\nCLINTON: Well, we have been. But at the same time, we are alsoknowledgeable enough about historical experiences to know that this isnot an easy journey for any people to make. There are many threatsand problems along the way.\n\nAMANPOUR: It is beyond dispute that the Obama administrationscaled back their democracy and freedom agenda of the Bushadministration. In Egypt, the funds for NGOs and the like, civilsociety, democracy-building, were cut back and furthermore weredirected, when they were directed, to NGOs that were supported by theMubarak regime. Was that a mistake?\n\nClinton: Well, first of all, I just reject the premise. I thinkthat there is...\n\nAMANPOUR: It's -- it's indisputable.\n\nCLINTON: Well, it's not. That's just not -- that's just not thecase. There were differences in approach under the same set of goalsto try to promote democracy, economic opportunity, women's rights,labor organizing. There are many different ways that I think all ofus, different administrations, different experts, have struggled with.\n\nThere is no debate that, for 30 years, Republican and Democraticadministrations alike sent the same message to President Mubarak andthe regime, that they had to change. And we were all trying differentways.\n\nYou know, I think it's fair to say that none of us wereparticularly successful, because we kept running into an absoluterejection that that was not going to be done in Egypt. But we triedmany different approaches, and we're going to try many differentapproaches in different settings, as well.\n\nAMANPOUR: The State Department just had an Arabic Twitteraccount, a Farsi Twitter account. This week, what do you expect to dowith that?\n\nCLINTON: Have you -- have you been following the Farsi Twitteraccount?\n\nAMANPOUR: I'm following it all.\n\nCLINTON: Excellent. Excellent. Well, what we expect to do isto be communicating through the new social media with literallymillions of people around the world, because we want them to heardirectly from us what our policies are. We want to use it to rebutsome of the falsehoods and accusations that, unfortunately, are madeagainst the United States.\n\nBut mostly we want to be in the mix with this incredible, young,energetic population that is seeking the same rights to expressthemselves as young people in the United States seek.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you very much.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you very much.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And this week, Secretary Clinton called on governmentsaround the world to respect and promote free access to the Internet.And when we return, we'll take you inside the revolution with theanonymous online revolutionaries who launched a movement.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: As we now know, behind the wave of uprisings in theMiddle East is a generation of educated, Internet-savvy, young Arabprofessionals. And their weapons? Social media, mostly made inAmerica, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook. In the darkest days of theprotests in Egypt, two anonymous activists kept the online movementalive.\n\nThis week, they agreed to tell us the gripping story of theirfight for freedom, which was not with tanks, but with tech.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Incredibly, one of the key players in theonline youth movement that helped bring down Hosni Mubarak was a 34-year-old Egyptian-American who never left Washington.\n\nWAHAB: I had contacts on the ground. People were asking me toget messages to them. People would turn to me and be like, \"Whatshould we do?\" And I'd be like, \"Well, I don't know. I never starteda revolution before.\"\n\nAMANPOUR: A year ago, Nadine Wahab connected online with theyoung Google marketing executive and anti-government activist WaelGhonim.\n\nGHONIM: They are basically a bunch of thugs, thieves, and, youknow, who have been ruining their -- our country. They're so 1970,and we're so 2010.\n\nAMANPOUR: They'd been trying to mobilize demonstrations throughFacebook since June of last year. And at first, the protests weresmall. But on January 25th, they posted this page calling for aprotest that mushroomed into a full-scale revolt. How?\n\nA week earlier, not so far way in Tunisia, young people hadforced out their authoritarian president. They had also takenadvantage of an explosion of social media that in just the last fouryears has electrified the Arab and Muslim world.\n\n(on-screen): Is this explosion of technology, the access amongso many people, is this the reason for these revolutions and uprisingsthat are going on, the turmoil?\n\nGHOSH: It's a planning tool, an organizing tool. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Bobby Ghosh has been reporting on theyouth movement for this week's Time magazine and says it's been key tospreading revolutionary fervor.\n\nGHOSH: So Tunisians can talk to Egyptians. Egyptians can talkto Yemenis. And it shows them that they're not alone.\n\nAMANPOUR: Arab satellite television also played a role.Electrified by what happened in Tunis, young Egyptians used Facebookto call for a protest in Tahrir Square.\n\nGHONIM: I put out an event and say, if 100,000 people confirm inthree days, then I'm going to take this seriously and, you know, tryand make it 1 million.\n\nAMANPOUR: Wael Ghonim blogged anonymously. So did his friend,Ahmed Saleh, a young lawyer, and they exchanged key tactical adviceonline.\n\nSALEH: On pages, on personal accounts, on groups that have veryspecific instructions from Tunisians to Egyptians. And so it givesyou instructions on how to deal with the tear gas, on how to deal withpolice generally, what the times of the day is better for you to go tothe street, how to deal with rubber bullets.\n\nAMANPOUR: The Facebook page became their corner cafe, the placeto meet, to recruit and share ideas.\n\nSALEH: One of the ideas that we're still trying to trace whereit had originated was -- is the idea to go to popular areas and bringpeople from the popular areas to specific public squares.\n\nAMANPOUR: After a week of protests, the Mubarak regime shut downthe Internet. Wael was arrested, but he had already made a plan topreserve the online movement.\n\nSALEH: In case he disappears or anything, I should take over thepage. If he's arrested, it's very expected that he would beinvestigated and tortured. So if the page had stopped working at thetime, that would be sort of incriminating for him.\n\nAMANPOUR: Half a world away, Nadine had set up a makeshift warroom in a D.C. townhouse.\n\nWAHAB: When the Internet went down is when my world sort ofturned topsy-turvy. It became surreal.\n\nAMANPOUR: They were determined to keep the page up and running.\n\nWAHAB: People would tell me, \"Nadine, they're not going to comefor you here.\" But I was terrified. When I was at night by myself, Iwas terrified.\n\nAMANPOUR: At the same time in Cairo, Ahmed also continued thework Wael had started. SALEH: When I wake up early in the morning, I post five or sixposts or as many as I could in very short time, couple of hours, andthen I post one sentence that says, \"I'm going to Tahrir.\"\n\nAMANPOUR: But even they were stunned when Wael was released andHosni Mubarak stepped aside.\n\nGHONIM: I'm proud to be an Egyptian since I've seen all these,you know, heroes in the street doing all these things that I neverthought Egyptians would do. And, you know -- you know, in -- in 15days, Egyptians learned what does it mean to me to involve in politicsand call for their rights.\n\nAMANPOUR: That moment emboldened a movement across the MiddleEast, filled with young people who now believe they can break the gripof repressive regimes, armed with something as simple as a cell phone.\n\n(on-screen): How wired is the whole region?\n\nGHOSH: It's quite substantially wired. Even people who youwould say are quite poor, live in the old city and 20 people to asmall home, they have a cell phone that -- it'll have a camera. Ifthey can afford it, it'll have sort of e-mail service or an Internetconnection.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): In Bahrain, the protesters in PearlSquare have makeshift charging stations for that vital weapon againstoppression.\n\n(UNKNOWN): It plays a big role, OK, in gathering people andgiving them instructions. Go here. Not go. Don't go there. OK,this place is dangerous. Don't try to attack policemen.\n\nAMANPOUR: In Yemen, Allah Jaban (ph) is helping to mobilizeyoung people by posting a few simple photos on Facebook.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Those people who go out and demonstrate, they'reyoung people, out there just to -- to ask the better for theircountries and ask for their rights.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thousands turned out and forced their president, AliAbdullah Saleh, to take back his plan to make himself president forlife. Watching this wave reach its borders, Saudi Arabia isdesperately trying to contain it. It set up a Facebook page where thechief of the royal court encourages you to post your complaintdirectly. And if you fax it in, they guarantee a response within 24hours.\n\nIn Iran, despite the government's attempts to block it, 90percent of the hits on this Facebook page still come from Iran.\n\n(on-screen): The people who are doing this, are these people whoare friendly to the United States?\n\nGHONIM: They are suspicious of the United States, most of them,their entire lives. But they're not viscerally anti-American. We'renot seeing flags being -- American flags being burnt. We're notseeing the American president or -- or Hillary Clinton being hung ineffigy. And so if the U.S. is able to conduct some smart diplomacy, Ithink it's possible to get over that hump of suspicion that they have.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): The Egyptian revolution wasn't drivenjust by the Internet and its super users, like Wael, Nadine and Ahmed,but by forces that have sparked revolution throughout history, thefight for basic freedom that connects us all.\n\nSALEH: The experience and the inspiration has no borders.\n\nWAHAB: It was much bigger than any of us, and it showed a -- adifferent model other than violence. You saw a people come togetherin a way that was just wonderful.\n\nGHOSH: The dream became true. And, you know, whatever we'vebeen fighting for since the 25th of January is now being realized.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And I'll continue to follow the unfolding events inthe Middle East in real time on Twitter and on my blog, my Facebookpage, or at abcnews.com.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: That's it for our program this week. Stay with ABCNews and abcnews.com for all the very latest on the uprisings in theMiddle East and the budget crisis here in Washington and around thecountry. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you again next week.",

Bernie Sanders earned laughter and applause during Saturday's Democratic debate for a line defending his progressive tax policy.\n\nWhen asked how he would pay for proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders said he would finance them by \"due-demanding: that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations - have gotten away with murder for years - start paying their fair share.\"\n\nCBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed the White House hopeful: \"Let's get specific. How high would you go? You've said before you'd go above 50 percent. How high?\"\n\n\"We haven't come up with an exact number yet,\" Sanders responded. \"But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent.\"\n\nAs an aside, he said, to loud cheers in the audience: \"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.\"\n\nSanders went on to say that his administration would \"end the absurdities as Warren Buffet often reminds us - that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses, or truck drivers that makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and the large corporations will pay when I'm president.\"\n\nIn fact, during the first term of Republican President Eisenhower, the marginal tax rate on regular income for those earning over $400,000 -- at the time, the highest income bracket -- was 92 percent. The tax rate was carried over from Democratic President Harry Truman's administration. This was the second-highest tax rate during the 20th century, following the 94 percent instituted by President Roosevelt during World War II for those making over $200,000 annually.\n\nIn 1954, under Eisenhower, the rate for the highest income bracket decreased to 91 percent.\n\nTaking into account these income tax rates, Sanders' assertion that he's not as \"socialist\" as Eisenhower's administration is correct: Sanders has said before that he doesn't believe his tax policy would tax the top bracket over 90 percent, though he has yet to offer up an exact number.\n\nAppearing on \"CBS This Morning\" in September, Sanders said \"We are going to ask the wealthiest people in this country who are doing phenomenally well, and many large corporations that are making billions of dollars of profits and not paying a nickel in taxes, to in fact start paying their fair share of taxes.\"\n\nWhen asked to specify, the Vermont senator said of taxing those in the highest income bracket, \"I don't think you have to go up to 90 percent.\"\n\nSanders, however, has also called for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's tenure.\n\nDuring Saturday's debate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended asking the wealthy to pay a higher share of taxes.\n\n\"Under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent,\" he pointed out.\n\nO'Malley is also correct on this point: Under President Reagan, those with annual incomes over $215,400 were taxed at a rate of 69.1 percent.",

    "text":"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post\u2019s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta\u2019s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump\u2019s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump\u2019s Sunday night\u2019s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans\u2019 freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. \u201cThese words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,\u201d Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies\u2019 advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. \u201cDonald Trump needs to humble himself,\u201d Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump\u2019s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. \u201cThere have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: \u201cHow does any woman work for Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America\u2019s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department\u2019s release of more of Clinton\u2019s own emails from her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump\u2019s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s candidacy appeared\u2014yet again\u2014to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta\u2019s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton\u2019s emails, which he called an \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump\u2019s words, however. \u201cWomen have the power to stop Trump,\u201d Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events\u2014and the responses\u2014would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cHe is talking about sexual assault. There\u2019s no other way to frame this,\u201d Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide\u2019s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches\u2014a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton\u2019s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa\u2019s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? \u201cClinton admits she is out of touch,\u201d \u201cClinton suggests she is a moderate\u201d and \u201cClinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.\u201d\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: \u201cClinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.\u201d Republicans are obsessed with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump\u2019s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump\u2019s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call \u201clocker-room banter\u201d laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women\u2019s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that \u201csuch vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\u2019s face to the world.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump \u201ca malignant clown.\u201d Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks\u201dtotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said \u201cAmerica deserves far better\u201d than Trump. Trump\u2019s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said \u201cno apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women.\u201d\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump\u2019s video. \u201cThey did their opposition research. This is what they had,\u201d former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. \u201cShe has to change the narrative.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump\u2019s supporters firmly in their camp. \u201cA 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump\u2019s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman\u2019s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there\u2019s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night\u2019s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.",

    "text":"May 9, 2010 \u2014 -- TAPPER: Good morning, and a happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching. We'll begin with a Sunday first, Attorney General Eric Holder. Welcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nHOLDER: It's good to be here.\n\nTAPPER: Well, let's start with the latest on the investigation into the failed Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad. What's the latest?\n\nHOLDER: Well, we've now developed evidence that shows that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the attack. We know that they helped facilitate it. We know that they probably helped finance it and that he was working at their direction.\n\nTAPPER: Is there any evidence that there's a cell that Shahzad was working with in the United States? Or was it just him operating from directions from Pakistan?\n\nHOLDER: All I can really say is that the investigation is ongoing and we are examining overseas connections that he might have, as well as any people he might have worked with here in the United States. But the investigation's ongoing in both those spheres.\n\nTAPPER: In the last few days, U.S. officials have met with Pakistani officials, and the message, as conveyed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on \"60 Minutes\" is this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: We want more. We expect more. We've made it very clear that if, heaven forbid, an attack like this that we can trace back to Pakistan were to have been successful, there would be very severe consequences.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: What would those consequences be? And what more do you need the Pakistanis to be doing, the Pakistani government, beyond increased military action in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban is primarily located?\n\nHOLDER: Well, in connection with the Shahzad investigation, they had been, I think, extremely aggressive, they've been cooperative with us, and I think we have been satisfied with the work that they have done. We want to make sure that kind of cooperation continues. To the extent that it does not, we will, as Secretary Clinton indicated, take the appropriate steps. But as of now, with regard to Shahzad, I think we're satisfied with the level of cooperation we've received.\n\nTAPPER: Did the Pakistani government know about Shahzad before this happened? And did they tell the U.S. government at all anything about that?\n\nHOLDER: We don't have any indication that the Pakistani government was aware of his plans or the attack that was planned by the Pakistani Taliban. We don't have any indication of that.\n\nTAPPER: OK, Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud of the Pakistani -- Pakistani Taliban appeared in a video last month saying the time is very near when a Fedayeen, or soldiers, will attack the American states in the major cities. At the time that he issued that warning, U.S. policymakers didn't think the Pakistani Taliban had the ability to reach into the United States. They were, obviously, wrong?\n\nHOLDER: Well, I'm not sure that we didn't think they had that ability. We didn't think that necessarily was their aim. We certainly have seen with the Shahzad incident that they have not only the aim, but the capability of doing that. And that's why they have taken on, I think, a new significance in our anti-terror fight.\n\nTAPPER: Shahzad was on a Treasury Department watch list since the late 1990s for bringing large sums of cash into this country. He was taken off that watch list. Did the U.S. government drop the ball?\n\nHOLDER: No, I don't think so. I think we have done a good job in monitoring those people who we need to identify as potential threats to the, you know, government, and I think one has to understand that in connection with the -- the resolution of this plot, American law enforcement I think was very successful.\n\nTAPPER: More than 200,000 people from the U.S. traveled to Pakistan last year. How on Earth do you keep track of which ones intend to do us harm?\n\nHOLDER: It is a difficult job. We have to try to use the various intelligence sources that we have, try to look for telltale signs for who we should be concerned about.\n\nThe vast majority of people who go to Pakistan and come from Pakistan to the United States are well intentioned. They have relatives. They have cultural ties to both countries. So we have to really try to focus and make sure that our attention is directed at those people who would do our nation harm.\n\nTAPPER: There have been reports that others arrested this year in terrorist plots in the United States had traveled to Pakistan. Are there any ties with Shahzad?\n\nHOLDER: Well, the investigation's ongoing. And we're looking at a variety of things to try to make sure that we hold everybody accountable who was responsible for this attempted attack. I think the investigation is proceeding at a good pace. We have developed, I think, a good amount of information in a relatively short period of time, but we will be continuing to work on it.\n\nTAPPER: There was a time when the FBI and law enforcement lost track of Shahzad after the attempted incident, before he got on the plane. What happened?\n\nHOLDER: Well, we lost contact with him for just a bit of time, but I think what people have to understand is that we had a layered approach so that at the end of the day I think we were always confident that he would be picked up, and the question was only where he would be picked up and when he would be picked up.\n\nA surveillance was conducted, but we wanted to have him at a fairly good distance so that we could observe him and see if he would make contact with other people who were connected to the plot. Contact was lost for a relatively short period of time.\n\nTAPPER: How long? An hour?\n\nHOLDER: Oh, I don't know, about an hour, so maybe something along those lines. But what was key and what ultimately proved to be successful was this layered approach. He was caught before he was able to leave the country.\n\nTAPPER: But he almost got out, right? I mean, we got lucky in a few ways. First of all, let's be honest: The reason that we avoided a horrible incident is because he was apparently an incompetent bomb- maker, right?\n\nHOLDER: Well, there certainly was a bit of that, but I think also one has to look at the overall operation. He was stopped before he was able to leave the country because of a notification that the FBI made to put him on the no-fly list. We also had vigilant citizens who looked at that vehicle that he left and saw the smoke coming out and notified the appropriate authorities.\n\nThis was, in some ways, I think, a good example of what an aroused American populace, coupled with a vigilant law enforcement community, can actually do.\n\nTAPPER: Critics say that he should not have been -- some critics say he should not have been his Miranda rights, the right to remain silent, et cetera. Now, I know that the public safety exception was invoked, so before he was read his rights, he was interrogated. But does the current Miranda system, which was created before I was born and was updated, this public safety exception, in 1984 -- so none of the crafters were really aware of this plot, this threat that we face today.\n\nDoes it give you the flexibility you need?\n\nHOLDER: Well, that's one of the things that we're looking at. I think we have to first say that the system that we have in place has proven to be effective. We have used our law enforcement authorities that we have as they now exist very effectively. People have been given Miranda warnings. People have continued to talk, as was the case here, as was the case with Abdulmutallab in Detroit.\n\nBut I think we also want to look at make determinations as to whether or not we have the necessary flexibility, whether we have a system that can deal with the situation that agents now confront. The public safety exception comes from a case called Quarles that dealt with a -- the robbery of a -- of a supermarket.\n\nWe're now dealing with international terrorism. And if we are going to have a system that is capable of dealing in a public safety context with this new threat, I think we have to give serious consideration to at least modifying that public safety exception. And that's one of the things that I think we're going to be reaching out to Congress to do, to come up with a proposal that is both constitutional, but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face.\n\nTAPPER: What kind of modification are you talking about, more time for the -- for investigation before the Miranda rights are read or what?\n\nHOLDER: Well, I think a number of possibilities, and those are the kinds of things that we'll be discussing with Congress, to make sure that we are as effective as we can be, that agents are clear in what it is that they can do and interacting with people in this context, so we're going to be working with Congress so that we come up with something that, as I said, gives the necessary clarity, is flexible, but is also constitutional, is also constitutional.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Joe Lieberman and some others introduced legislation this past week which would give the State Department the right to strip the U.S. citizenship from anyone who is designated a foreign terrorist agent. I understand the administration does not support this and thinks that there are constitutional issues, but there's a point that Senator Lieberman made about the fact that President Obama currently has the authority -- at least according to Lieberman, who's the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee -- to order the assassination of a U.S. citizen, the cleric Awlaki, and -- well, this is what Senator Lieberman had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLIEBERMAN: If the president can authorize the killing of a United States citizen because he is fighting for a foreign terrorist organization, we can also have a law that allows the U.S. government to revoke Awlaki's citizenship and that of other American citizens who have cast their lot with terrorist organizations.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Isn't there a strange double-standard here? The administration gets all offended about revoking, you know, terrorist suspects' citizenship, but feels no compunction at all about ordering their assassination?\n\nHOLDER: Well, I'm not going to assume that what has been said there about ordering anybody's assassination is necessarily true. But with regard to the bill that Senator Lieberman is potentially talking about, that's not something I had a chance to really review. There are potential constitutional issues with it, as I've seen some critics discuss. I've not had a chance, as I said, to review it in any great detail, but I think what people have to understand is that the system we presently have in place takes terrorists and can put them in jail for extended periods of time. We can put people in jail fro the rest of their lives. We can even execute people under the law as it presently exists, and one has to wonder whether we need to go further than that.\n\nTAPPER: I want to turn to a couple of other topics. You and the White House have been proud of the improved review process for the release or transfer of detainees from Guantanamo, and in fact, writing of those detainees who had been released and who have returned to terrorism, White House counterterrorism czar John Brennan wrote in February, quote, \"I want to underscore the fact that all these cases relate to detainees released during the previous administration and under the prior detainee review process,\" but in fact there are reports that a detainee released by the Obama administration in December into Afghanistan, Abdul Hafeez (ph), has rejoined the Taliban. Did this review process fail?\n\nHOLDER: I've seen this story. I've not seen the intelligence necessarily that confirms that. I don't think -- one has to understand that the process that we've put in place, of the 240 prisoners who were in Guantanamo when we took office, was exhaustible. It involved the law enforcement community, it involved the intelligence community. We took into account all of the information we had on each one of those people, did an analysis of each of them, and made a determination as to who potentially was a threat. Only put people in countries where we thought structures could be in place, put in place so that they would not be a threat--\n\nTAPPER: What structure could possibly exist in Afghanistan?\n\nHOLDER: Well, that's one of the reason why, for instance, with regard to Yemen, the president has made a determination that we're going to suspend the repatriation of people to Yemen to make sure that we don't take anybody out of Guantanamo and put them in a country where they could pose a threat to the United States or to American military forces.\n\nTAPPER: But you're not going to confirm that Abdul Hafeez has rejoined the fight against the United States.\n\nHOLDER: I am not in a position to confirm that. As I said, I've not seen any intelligence that corroborates that.\n\nTAPPER: OK. Last fall, you announced that the trial of the century against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other 9\/11 plotters would take place in New York City, but it seems to me that that's walked back by the White House. Here is what you had to say about the president's response to your announcement of the trial last fall to PBS.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHOLDER: He has a personal belief that the president is supposed to be hands off with his Justice Department, and those things that are the province of the attorney general, all he needs to be is informed.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: This doesn't seem to be the case any longer. Are you disappointed that the White House seems to be politicizing the decisions you make about the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?\n\nHOLDER: I don't think the decision has been politicized at all. This is a national security matter, and I think it's appropriate for the president to be involved in that decision. We are working to see exactly where the trial will be held. Nothing is really off the table at this point. We are trying to come up with a place where these people can be brought to justice as quickly as we can, taking into consideration a variety of things that we have to consider. And I think in that regard, the involvement of the president, given the fact that it is a national security matter, as opposed to something else the Justice Department might be doing, his involvement I think is appropriate.\n\nTAPPER: You've said we're a nation of cowards because we don't talk freely and openly about race. So in that spirit, let me give it a shot. Do you think the Arizona immigration law is racist?\n\nHOLDER: Well, I don't think it's necessarily a good idea. I mean, I think we have to understand that the immigration problem that we have, illegal immigration problem that we have, is a national one, and a state-by-state solution to it is not the way in which we ought to go.\n\nTAPPER: But your issue with it is not that it's state-by-state. Your issue with it is that there are concerns that there might be racial profiling that takes place, right?\n\nHOLDER: That is certainly one of the concerns that you have, that you'll end up in a situation where people are racially profiled, and that could lead to a wedge drawn between certain communities and law enforcement, which leads to the problem of people in those communities not willing to interact with people in law enforcement, not willing to share information, not willing to be witnesses where law enforcement needs them. I think you have to think about the collateral consequences of such a law, understanding the frustration that people feel in Arizona. IT's one of the reasons why I think we have to have a national solution to this immigration problem.\n\nTAPPER: Do you think it's racist?\n\nHOLDER: I don't think it's racist in its motivation. But I think the concern I have is how it will be perceived and how it perhaps could be enacted, how it could be carried out. I think we could potentially get on a slippery slope where people will be picked on because of how they look as opposed to what they have done, and that is I think something that we have to try to avoid at all costs.\n\nTAPPER: The oil company BP has a spotty record when it comes to cutting corners and, in some cases, worker safety. Are you looking into the oil spill in the gulf, possible criminal charges, and ways to make sure that these companies -- not just BP, but Halliburton and the others -- are held accountable?\n\nHOLDER: Well, our primary concern at this point is to try to make sure that we keep that oil offshore, that we disperse it, that we scoop it up, that we burn it, that we do all those kinds of things so that it can't get to shore and do damage to our wetlands, damage businesses that are on the coast.\n\nI've sent down representatives from the Justice Department to examine what our options are with regard to the activities that occurred there and whether or not there has been misfeasance, malfeasance on the part of BP or Oceana (ph).\n\nSo we're looking at that situation. But as I said, our primary focus at this point -- through our Department of Homeland Security, the Interior Department -- is really try to deal with the spill.\n\nTAPPER: All right. That's all the time we have. Attorney General Eric Holder, thank you so much for coming by.\n\nHOLDER: Well, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\n\nTAPPER: And joining me now from New York, former mayor and Republican presidential candidate, Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, thank you, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: Now, you're a former U.S. attorney. If you had been in charge of this investigation, what -- into Faisal Shahzad, what would you do differently, if anything?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, I would not have given him Miranda warnings after just a couple of hours of questioning. I would have instead declared him an enemy combatant, asked the president to do that, and at the same time, that would have given us the opportunity to question him for a much longer period of time. Whether it works in the case of Shahzad or it doesn't, the reality is, the better policy is to give the intelligence agents who are going to question him the maximum amount of time to question him, to check out the credibility of what he's saying.\n\nI mean, I don't know yet what the truth is here. We shouldn't. I mean, I think too much has been leaked about this, and the administration has talked too much about it, because the more you talk about it, the more you warn people in the Taliban to go hide somewhere.\n\nWhen I was a prosecutor and associate attorney general, the last thing in the world I wanted to do is to have the other side figure out, you know, the information we had before we had a chance to act on it. So the reality is, just to figure -- just to get these guys to tell the truth and then to corroborate how much they're saying and for them to remember, it's going to take three, four, five days of questioning.\n\nTo cut it off after 30 or 40 minutes like they did in Detroit on Christmas Day or to cut it off after two or three hours doesn't make much sense. And if they think they need to change the law, well, my goodness, have some urgency about it and go do it. Don't just think about it.\n\nTAPPER: So you support what Attorney General Holder had to say about going to Congress and trying to get an updated Miranda warning?\n\nGIULIANI: I do. I do. I support it, but I really at this point am frustrated by the lack of urgency that is shown about these terrorism matters. I mean, we've had three now where we've seen, you know, big breakdowns: Fort Hood, Christmas Day, and now -- and now this one.\n\nIt's about time that we stopped thinking about it and we stopped studying it. I don't know how often the attorney general said he was studying things. How about we stop studying and we start doing things, like we change Miranda, like we fix what appears to be a policy of political correctness in which we missed every signal that related to Major Hasan and promoted him in the military?\n\nAnd here we missed some very big signals that Shahzad was giving us, going back to Pakistan, remaining there for five or six months, bringing in -- I've forgotten exactly how much cash he brought in from Pakistan, but I think it was something like $60,000...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: It was something like -- I think it was $80,000...\n\nGIULIANI: Eighty thousand dollars in cash.\n\nTAPPER: ... but it was several -- several years ago, yes.\n\nGIULIANI: Yes, but that doesn't trigger an alarm, even several years ago?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: ... triggered an alarm and he was...\n\nGIULIANI: ... fix these things now instead of talking about them.\n\nTAPPER: Apparently, it did trigger an alarm. He was put on a Treasury watch list, but I'm not sure what more could have been done after that.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, don't you see a pattern here, Jake? And I'm not -- I'm just not talking about the Obama administration. I'm talking about our entire apparatus that has to be fixed. We missed the signals with -- with the -- the -- the bomber in -- in -- in Detroit. We missed the signals with Major Hasan. We missed the signals here.\n\nMaybe we've got to say to ourselves, let's go back and fix all this, rather than study it, to see what we're going to do. We've been at this long enough now to stop studying and start doing things.\n\nTAPPER: I want to talk about the fact that you think that Shahzad should be tried as an enemy combatant. Can you point to any time when a U.S. citizen was interrogated as an enemy combatant as opposed to in the criminal system where the result, the interrogation was more successful than apparently this interrogation is going? I mean, Attorney General Holder and other law enforcement officials say...\n\nGIULIANI: Oh, sure.\n\nTAPPER: ... this is going very well.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, yes, that's OK. I like that. I'm glad it's going very well. And I've, you know, administered Miranda warnings probably 1,000 times, and sometimes they work and the person -- they worked to have the person keep -- keep talking. Sometimes the person stops talking. It depends on the reaction of the person. It's the matter of policy that concerns me.\n\nThis is not a smart thing to do. It doesn't make sense to interrupt a terrorist in the middle of his confessing and talking to you. I think even Attorney General Holder realizes that, which is why he wants to go to Congress and seem to get more time for that.\n\nAll I'm saying is, OK, do it. What they did in Detroit, in giving Major -- rather...\n\nTAPPER: Abdulmutallab.\n\nGIULIANI: ... Abdulmutabalab (sic) a -- a -- right, giving him a warning after -- after 30 minutes makes no sense. It makes no sense to do that. So, sure, it may work sometimes; it may not work other times. It's not the best policy to follow.\n\nAnd so far, two in a row, we've gotten lucky. So let's not rely on luck. Let's rely on solid policy.\n\nTAPPER: My understanding, during the Abdulmutallab incident, is that -- is that actually after about 50 minutes they had to take him to get medical care, and that's why he stopped talking then, because he actually -- his life was in danger. But be that as it may, I fear the point you're making.\n\nI want to ask you a question about, in the trial of Richard Reid in 2003, Judge William Young said to Richard Reid in 2003, \"You're not an enemy combatant. You're a terrorist. You're not a soldier in any war. To give you that reference, to call you a soldier gives you far too much stature. We do not negotiate with terrorists. We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice.\"\n\nThat's a different attitude than the one you're talking about. Some people say that by making somebody like Shahzad, who is certainly less successful than several of the mobsters you put away, who did far more heinous things than Shahzad actually was able to accomplish, but were tried in a criminal court, they say that what you're proposing would elevate somebody like Shahzad.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, that's absurd, of course. I mean, you get more rights as a civilian defendant than you do as an enemy combatant, so that's a matter of semantics. Maybe you're giving them more status in terms of semantics, but you're giving them less rights, which is really important.\n\nI mean, look at this whole thing with Senator Lieberman's recommendation that citizenship be revoked and look at the reluctance of the attorney general to support that. It shows a sort of sense of, I don't know, not understanding the magnitude of the problem.\n\nI mean, why shouldn't we revoke the citizenship of someone who's been designated the -- an agent of a foreign -- of a foreign power or an agent of a -- of a terrorist group? Of course we should. Of course we should be able to revoke it. And I'd be happy to test the constitutionality of that.\n\nInstead we have an attorney general who's studying that, also. They're at war with us, and we're spending time studying what rights they have. This doesn't make much sense, Jake. We're worried more about the rights of the terrorists, it seems -- or at least pondering that -- more than we are urgency about actually curing some of these things that will keep us safe and not have us rely on luck, which is how we got -- got through these last two ones.\n\nTAPPER: We only have a little bit more time. I want to just get your reaction to what happened in Utah yesterday where Senator Bob Bennett, conservative Republican, lost his party primary. Are you worried at all that the Republican Party is not only growing more hostile to more liberal to moderate Republicans such as yourself, but also conservative Republicans who are shown to -- at least shown an ability to work with Democrats?\n\nGIULIANI: No, I don't think so. I think the reality is that the Republican Party is very much based on its core principles. I think it's operating from its core principles. And I think that at this point, you know, President Obama has pushed the envelope so far that Republican Party wants to have candidates who are going to be -- be effective in standing up to the administration's inexorable march toward European social democracy.\n\nI mean, I -- I see an administration that both in terms of economics and in terms of foreign policy, national security, seems to be moving us in the direction of European social democracy, with government taking over large segments of our -- of our economy, from car companies to banks to the energy industry, which they're trying to do, their health care industry, regulated in a minute (ph) way, the way the social democracies will -- which largely have failed in Europe -- have been doing now for -- you know, for several generations.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Unfortunately...\n\nGIULIANI: We need Republicans who are ideologically committed to standing up against that and really moving us in a different direction. I think that's what you see going on with the Tea Party movement. I think that's what you see going on in these -- in these elections.\n\nTAPPER: All right, wonderful. Thank you so much, Mayor Giuliani. That's all the time we have.\n\nGIULIANI: Thank you, Jake. Always nice to talk to you.\n\nTAPPER: Appreciate it. Nice talking to you, sir.\n\nThe roundtable is next with George Will, Robin Wright, Shelby Steele, and John Podesta. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\nTAPPER: Scenes from the flash crash on Thursday. We'll get to the economy and the Greek debt crisis in a second with our roundtable. As always, George Will, Shelby Steele, author and a gentleman from the Hoover Institution, former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta of the Center for American Progress, and author and journalist Robin Wright of the center -- of the Institute of Peace. Did I get that right...\n\nWRIGHT: U.S. Institute for Peace.\n\nTAPPER: U.S. Institute for Peace. I'm sorry. I have so many organizations in my head.\n\nWe're going to get to the economy in a second, but I want to start with national security, given the conversations we just had with Attorney General Holder and Mayor Giuliani. George, what does this attempted terrorist attack say to you? What's the message from the attempted Times Square attack?\n\nWILL: It is that the Pakistan connection, if true, is good news in the sense that it indicates the decline of the tradecraft of terrorism over time. The underwear bomber at Christmas and this man, also, are staggeringly incompetent and minor league figures compared to the amazing precision and scale of the 9\/11 attacks.\n\nProbably credit goes to both the Bush and the Obama administration for the extraordinary pressure with the drone attacks and all the rest that are being put on the Taliban and other supporters who are now footloose and having trouble coordinating.\n\nThe bad news -- if there is bad news in this -- is the targeting of Times Square. Let me tell you a story. Right after 9\/11, I asked Jack Valenti, the late Jack Valenti, then chairman of the motion picture association, if he worried that someone might target Universal Studios as a symbol of Western decadence. He said, no, what worries me is six backpack bombs in six cineplexes around the country on a Saturday night. That would put huge economic damage on the movie industry. The question is, have they begun to figure that out?\n\nTAPPER: Shelby, the ideology of Islamism still seems to be powerful even if the quality, the candidates of terrorists that the Pakistani Taliban and others are getting are not as good. The ideology seems just as strong. This guy lived, Faisal Shahzad, who we should say is innocent until proven guilty, but he's lived in the United States and had not a bad life here.\n\nSTEELE: Right, right. No, I think the ideology is the -- is the story. It's -- there's a larger clash, I think in the world, between the third world, people who were formally oppressed and so forth, who coming into freedom experience that as shame and came in, really, into a sort of confrontation with their own inferiority, their sense of inferiority. And I think jihadism is an ideology that compensates for a sense of inferiority.\n\nAnd that's really its appeal. It has no real religious connection. These are not particularly religious people. But they're people who, as they -- as they sort of move into modernity, fail or having a rough time making that kind of transition, and so therefore there's this wonderful ideology based in the idea of killing people, of death, you know, if I put on the gun on the table now, I'm the most powerful man in the -- in the room. I'm not inferior anymore.\n\nAnd it's that -- sort of the grandiosity of administering death randomly is extremely attractive to people who -- who had this inner sense that I'm just never going to make that -- that move into modernity.\n\nTAPPER: John, I want to play some sound for you from House Minority Leader John Boehner talking on Thursday about this attempted attack.\n\nPODESTA: OK.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBOEHNER: Yes, we've been lucky, but luck is not an effective strategy for fighting the terrorist threat. This is a nation at war. And stopping at nothing to confront and defeating the terrorist threat, this is how we best protect the American people and set an example for the rest of the world.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: You heard the attorney general. There was some luck at stake here. How do you see Republicans responding to this?\n\nPODESTA: Well, you know, Widair (ph) said let's take advantage of it, the Republican pollster. I think you see John Boehner there. Nobody can even pause for a second to give credit to the New York City police, to the -- to the FBI, to the customs bureau for what was really a rapid roll-up of this guy, pulling him off the plane and putting him into custody, getting now him to talk.\n\nSo I think that they're almost -- they're on the verge of rooting for failure here, because I think they want to damage Obama so badly. And I think that that's tragic for the country.\n\nAnd, you know, it seems to me that what they need to do is to recognize success, to push the system to do a better job. I think one of the things that George said is relevant, I think, which is that there's more pressure now on the Pakistani Taliban because of more effective strategy that's being employed in Pakistan, but that means that we're likely to be confronted with -- with more threat.\n\nAnd I think it's time for the Republicans to get on board and try to find at least in this space -- I can understand it on -- you know, they almost root for failure on the economy side, as -- as well. They, you know, describe the job number, for example, on Friday as bad news, 290,000 jobs. But this is, I think, beyond the pale.\n\nTAPPER: Robin, what are your sources telling you about Faisal Shahzad and his involvement with the Pakistani Taliban?\n\nWRIGHT: Well, apparently, he's singing like a bird, I was told last night. But there are also a lot of tall tales that he's telling, and they have to keep going back to him over and over and over because a lot of it's not making sense. There are some inconsistencies.\n\nHe says, for example, that he met with the leader of the Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, and yet here he carried out an operation that was as amateurish as anything we have seen since 9\/11. And this is a group that is capable of very sophisticated operations...\n\nTAPPER: The Pakistani Taliban is?\n\nWRIGHT: The Pakistani Taliban is very sophisticated in the kinds of operations. And here's a guy who buys some fireworks that, according to the manufacturing, couldn't blow up a watermelon.\n\nI think that one of the interesting things is still, what was his motive? And this is a guy who didn't -- was not engaged in a suicide bomb. He was engaged in an operation where he walked away and intended to fly back to...\n\nTAPPER: Left the keys in the car...\n\nWRIGHT: ... and left the keys to his car and to his home, I mean, and that -- that there are some questions about, have we reached a point where the Taliban doesn't necessarily need to even go out and recruit people, that there are Muslims who are angry about what the United States is doing in Pakistan, along the border with particularly the drone attacks, and did he respond because of what he saw when he went home?\n\nAnd there's a real danger that we're crossing a line into unintended consequences. In the same way Osama bin Laden was a de facto ally of the United States until after the U.S. deployed in the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, turned on the United States and Saudi Arabia, and we've seen the consequences of that. Are there dangers that we're creating another generation of people as a result of U.S. military strategy?\n\nWILL: There are many millions of angry people who are angry for the reasons Shelby mentioned. Sooner or later, some of them are going to set off bombs in America, and it's time for the leaders of both parties to begin preparing Americans for this, to say this is inevitable, you can't be perfect, and to get used to it, and to point to the fact that the Israelis have a vibrant democracy, a robust economy, and a terrorism problem, and always have.\n\nTAPPER: The -- there was a response to the attack from Glenn Beck the other day that I thought was interesting, because he specifically was talking about whether or not Shahzad should have been read his Miranda rights. Here's Glenn Beck on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBECK: It's easy to follow the Constitution when you benefit from it or you're not affected by it. But what happens when you go against what you want to do, when you want to strap this guy down to the rack and make him talk, but you don't because it violates the Constitution? That's what makes this country different.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: It's obviously not \"Fox and Friends.\" It's his own show. But here we have Glenn Beck saying that there's nothing wrong with Mirandizing somebody like Shahzad, who's an American citizen. And you have not only Republican leaders, but Attorney General Eric Holder talking about changing the Miranda laws.\n\nI never thought that I'd -- I'd see Glenn Beck as a beacon of reason when it comes to this specific issue, but what's going on here, Shelby?\n\nSTEELE: Well, I think people are genuinely confused about -- about this issue. I mean, I am. I hear -- I hear all sorts of -- you know, some people say you need -- you don't need -- doesn't really matter whether you Mirandize people or not, because they're going to be -- they're going to talk, and you want to befriend them, and you want them to give you information, and when they do give you that information, it may or not be held against them anyway.\n\nSo it's -- it's difficult to -- it's difficult to know what to -- which way to go on this. I think Glenn Beck is sort of taking the classic constitutional position and saying, let's -- let's make sure we do it the right way. This is what makes us unique as Americans, and so let's Mirandize people that we may suspect are terrorists.\n\nTAPPER: John?\n\nPODESTA: Yes, well, you know, for all those people who want to, as Mayor Giuliani said, put him in -- into the military system, I think if you look back and see what's happened, Shahzad, Abdulmutallab, the Headley in Chicago, Zazi, they were all given their Miranda rights. They kept cooperating. They kept talking, as Shelby was indicating. They got actionable intelligence out of them.\n\nIf you look at the two cases under the Bush administration where U.S. citizens were declared enemy combatants...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Al-Marri and Jose Padilla, yes.\n\nPODESTA: ... al-Marri and Jose Padilla, they were put into a military detention system, they didn't talk for years. Finally, you know, the cases ended up being resolved on the other side.\n\nSo I think the real question is, what works? And I think there's some indication that the path that the attorney general has proceeded down is working better than -- than -- than the alternative there's being suggested.\n\nI think this idea of expanding the public safety exception is one that ought to be taken up by Congress and probably will be in short order.\n\nTAPPER: Robin, what's wrong with the argument that this is a war that we're in and so we should treat these individuals as enemies of the state and treat them -- you know, Dr. Sam Mudd, who was accused of participating in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, he went before a military tribunal. I mean, it's not like these things were just hatched up by George W. Bush. Why is it so crazy?\n\nWRIGHT: Well, I think that, as we find more and more of these operatives are working inside the United States and they're not coming from the outside, that we have some real questions to answer. And you see also what Senator Lieberman has introduced this week about stripping people of their citizenship. There's a lot of confusion about, what do we do? How do we handle them? Who qualifies as an American? If you engage in terrorism, do you -- is their citizenship then liable?\n\nAnd there are some real constitutional questions about all of these issues. How far do we want to go in stripping the rights of the document that -- that makes us a great nation? And there are problems with -- for example, in the Lieberman bill, at what point do you say that anyone who votes, anyone who serves in another country, anyone who serves in a foreign army is eligible to have their citizenship stripped...\n\nTAPPER: Right, that already is on the books. Those laws are already on the books.\n\nWRIGHT: Right. But the fact is, it's not -- it's not applied. There are lots of Americans who have served in the Israeli army. In an era of globalization, you see lots of nationalities where people vote in American elections and they vote in the country from which they came. And so that becomes -- it really opens up a Pandora's box if we -- if we engage in actions like that.\n\nTAPPER: I want to switch to another topic now, and that is, in addition to today being Mother's Day -- and happy Mother's Day, by the way -- today's also Europe Day, and Europe is going through quite some problems right now when it comes to the Greek debt crisis.\n\nGeorge, you've wanted to talk about this for a long time, and I've resisted, and I apologize for that, but why is it, do you think, that we don't hear much from policymakers, from the media about the Greek debt crisis? Or, you know what? Forget that question. Why should the American people care about this?\n\nWILL: Because it's an early heart attack that ought to alert us to the fact that we could have a bigger heart attack. Greece is not too big to fail. It has a GDP the size of a Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. It's too connected.\n\nWhat we are doing, and the Europeans are doing, and Americans are doing through the International Monetary Fund, is we're bailing out the banks that have -- particularly the French and German banks -- that have bought a lot of Greek paper.\n\nNow, the fact is, the United Kingdom has a worse fiscal picture. Los Angeles has a worse fiscal picture.\n\nSTEELE: California has a worse...\n\nWILL: California in general, New Jersey, Illinois.\n\nTAPPER: Worse than Greece?\n\nWILL: Yes, in some senses. What we're doing at this point is we're seeing the collapse of a model, a welfare state model, that says you can constantly enlarge government on a narrower and narrower tax base, producing more and more people dependent on the government.\n\nWhat they said in Greece, the caption under the pictures, it said, \"Anti-government mobs.\" They're composed of government employees, these anti-government mobs, fighting for their entitlements.\n\nTAPPER: And, Shelby, you know, one of the things that I thought was interesting about these -- about these mobs protesting and rioting about austerity cuts in -- in -- tax increases and service cuts, is that it's really not that difficult to imagine the United States in a similar position and people getting angry about it, not just government workers, but conservative activists, liberal activists, everyone getting angry about it, because we, too, want to have our cake and -- and eat it, too.\n\nSTEELE: There's always this impulse in government to do the good, to do something that -- and make sure everybody, every human being alive in the -- in your country has health insurance and so forth. And it's fine and -- fine to do the good, but the only way to do it is to also grant people -- expand the idea of entitlement and make people actually feel, as a part of their identity, that they are owed something.\n\nAnd then as -- as time goes on and you -- as George says, you -- you -- they call this a debt crisis. It's really an overspending crisis, where you're -- you're just constantly finding -- trying to do good things, expanding entitlement. You get to a place where it starts to collapse. California, my state, is in dire straits right now for this. And we have some of the similar people rioting, students complaining about the UC system cuts and so forth.\n\nThere's no money. There's just no money. So it's not as though somebody is doing something evil or oppressive. The state just has no money.\n\nTAPPER: John, I want to put up a graphic here. It shows public debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product, in Greece, it's 113.4 percent. In the United States, 52.9 percent. That's still a lot, and that's only public debt. That's not including some of the shenanigans that our government -- some of the chicanery and shell game that we have going on with the Social Security trust fund and such.\n\nHow -- how important is it for the American people to pay attention to what's going on in Greece because we're going to be facing that same problem some day soon?\n\nPODESTA: Well, I think there are two issues, and they're related. One is the one that George raised, which is Greece is linked into a system that could in the very near term affect our growth. And the most important we need to do right now is to continue the job numbers that came out on Friday, the pace of expansion of the U.S. economy. That's the most important factor that's going to get our deficits down and get our debt under control.\n\nBut over the long term, we -- there's a structural deficit. When I -- when you put that chart up on the board, 52 percent, it reminded me that when I left the White House, it was 32 percent, 33 percent, I think.\n\nI think that there was a lot of structural deficit built in, in the 1980s. The absence of regulation -- we talked about the expansion of government, the absence of government, the absence of regulation in the financial sector led to a great collapse and -- and a response to create demand in the economy, to put people back to work.\n\nBut over time, we've got to get that deficit down. We've got to get the -- and I think that the administration is going to be challenged by this, and I think that's why Secretary Gates' speech yesterday talking about the need to even restrain the growth of military spending and use those savings to support the force structure that's necessary is -- was quite a significant speech, and probably didn't get as much attention as it deserved.\n\nTAPPER: We only have a couple more minutes, but I want to turn to some big breaking news from yesterday, which was in Utah. Incumbent Senator Bob Bennett lost his party's primary. Here's Senator Bennett reacting to the news.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBENNETT: The political atmosphere, obviously, has been toxic. And it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment. Looking back on them, with one or two very minor exceptions, I wouldn't have cast any of them any differently, even if I had known at the time they were going to cost me my career.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Shelby, what's going on? This guy's a pretty legitimate conservative. I mean, I know he's done some things that have angered the right, but he's not a liberal.\n\nSTEELE: That's right. No, he's a sort of classic, down-the-line conservative. But I think that -- and there's some anti-incumbent sentiment here -- but I think the Tea Party and conservatives generally at this point are looking for conservatives who are anti-Obama, in that this has a -- this is really as much a reaction to Obama and -- and the kinds of expansion of government and so forth that he's -- that he has embarked on, as -- as -- I think it's more that than a fight among conservatives, and that Bennett is sort of, in a sense, a casualty of Obama.\n\nTAPPER: George?\n\nWILL: This is an anti-Washington year. How do you get more Washington than a three-term senator who occupies the seat once held by his father, a four-term senator, who before that worked on the Senate staff and then as a lobbyist in Washington? He's a wonderful man and a terrific senator, but the fact is, he's going against terrific headwinds this year, and he cast three votes, TARP, stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care.\n\nNow, you might like one, two or all three of those, but being opposed to them is not outside the mainstream of American political argument.\n\nTAPPER: Twenty seconds, Robin. What's going on here?\n\nWRIGHT: Well, it's the beginning of a trend. You have the next coming up, Kentucky, and Arizona, and New Hampshire. We're likely to see this elsewhere. It's fascinating to see how many new delegates were participating in the -- yesterday. Democracy's about the majority, but it's about the majority of people who participate. And in this case, a certain kind of people participated, and their candidate won.\n\nTAPPER: All right. The roundtable is going to continue in the green room on abcnews.com. And later, check out our fact checks.",

    "text":"November 21, 2010 \u2014 -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Welcome to viewers here and around the world. I'm Christiane Amanpour.\n\nAnd at the top of the news this week: nuclear secret, a report of a major advance in North Korea's nuclear program. What new threat does it pose? And how will it impact the president's disarmament agenda and his push to get the Senate to ratify his START nuclear treaty?\n\nOBAMA: This is not about politics. It's about national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: This morning, the nation's top military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. Plus, the escalating war in Afghanistan. His views on night raids, relations with President Karzai, and deadlines for U.S. withdrawal.\n\nThen, hot zone. As Haiti reels from a cholera outbreak, we ask, what happened to the global pledge to rebuild the nation?\n\nAnd G.M.'s new start. Was the bailout good for America after all? Analysis on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\n\nPlus, the Sunday funnies.\n\nLETTERMAN: The Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrives this week. And as soon as it gets to Washington, it will die in committee. Did you know that?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Hello again. And with reports of a new nuclear facility in North Korea and a new deadline in the Afghanistan war, there's a lot to discuss with our guest, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nPresident Obama returned late last night from the NATO summit in Lisbon where the United States and its allies are now talking about another deadline, the end of 2014 to hand over combat operations to Afghan forces. To make that happen, American and NATO forces are escalating the war right now, and so we start with a powerful report from ABC's Mike Boettcher in Afghanistan.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBOETTCHER (voice-over): When Lieutenant Colonel Steve Lutsky last saw 10-year-old Sadekela (ph), he was bleeding to death on the side of a road.\n\nLUTSKY: His mom was yelling out that, \"My son is dead. My son is dead.\"\n\nBOETTCHER: Now he is recovering at a U.S. military hospital. The lives of the American officer and the Afghan boy intersected on this stretch of highway in Khost province, when a car bomber trying to kill Lutsky and his men attacked their column.\n\n(on-screen): The American convoy was traveling this direction. The other way, civilian vehicles. They slowed down when the convoy passed. So did a suicide bomber. And inside his car, he had 600 pounds of high explosives.\n\n(voice-over): The soldiers were not hurt, but the explosion killed one child and injured three others, including Sadekela (ph). Now angry at the Taliban, Sadekela's (ph) family is grateful to the Americans for saving his life, a small but important victory in a war where not killing civilians is more important than killing the enemy.\n\nTOWNSEND: It buys us credit, in the sense that there's a little more respect for us and there's a little more trust for us.\n\nBOETTCHER: America's top officers tell Afghans that it's the Taliban who are killing civilians, a message undermined by President Karzai's claims that U.S. special operations night raids are killing innocent people.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Nine out of 10 civilian casualties are caused by the Taliban.\n\nBOETTCHER: At a district center in eastern Afghanistan, not everyone is convinced by that argument. During a visit by the 101st Airborne's deputy commander in Afghanistan, Steve Townsend (ph), a village elder asserted that the Americans were killing more Afghans than the Soviets did a quarter century ago. Townsend pushed back hard.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Look in my eyes right now. You know I'm telling the truth.\n\nBOETTCHER: But as the words fly, so do bombs and bullets. Combat Outpost Firra (ph), situated on the Pakistan border, is often attacked. During one assault, 18 insurgents died, but soldiers know this: You can't kill your way out of Afghanistan.\n\n(UNKNOWN): They can reconstitute faster than we can. We're so close to Pakistan that they just come right across the border.\n\nBOETTCHER: So rather than enemy body counts, real success here is measured in how quickly Afghan feet can fill American-made boots. If the war is to end, Afghan soldiers will have to end it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We have to make a difference. Coming here and -- and just running around and killing the enemy and then leaving and looking back and saying, \"I didn't make a difference, I didn't make a change,\" will cause us to never leave.\n\nBOETTCHER: Steve Lutsky's son is the same age as young Sadekela (ph), 10. The colonel wants only one thing to come from his service here: confidence that his own son someday will not be fighting his father's war.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Mike Boettcher, ABC News, Forward Operating Base Clark, Afghanistan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: And joining me now is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nWelcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nMULLEN: Good morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we will discuss, of course, Afghanistan, but let me get to the breaking news this morning, the report by the New York Times of the discovery of a new nuclear facility in North Korea. How much of a threat is that to the United States, to the world?\n\nMULLEN: Well, this validates a long-standing concern that we've had with respect to North Korea and -- and its enrichment of uranium. It also continues to validate a country that is led by a dictator who is constantly -- who constantly desires to destabilize the region. And he's done that again, certainly, with this capability, as well.\n\nAnd certainly the development of nuclear weapons is a huge concern for all of us, those in the region, as well as those around the globe.\n\nAMANPOUR: How could this have happened in secret, despite the sanctions that were put on? Practically as the sanctions were put on, this was being built.\n\nMULLEN: Well, he's defied sanctions. There are two, actually, U.N. Security Council sanctions that he's defied in this. He's defied what he said he'd do in 2005, because he said he clearly would comply and not -- not do the -- generate this kind of capability, and yet he does.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. But what options, then, do you have? If sanctions are the toughest measure and he's doing it, what's your answer to that?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think we have to continue to bring pressure on him specifically. Those in the region -- in particular the six-party talk countries, Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, we all -- we have to continue to do that.\n\nHe is predictable in his unpredictability, if you will, because not too long ago, he killed 46 South Korean sailors. He has over time continued to destabilize this region. And, in fact, I also believe that this has to do with a succession plan for his son.\n\nAMANPOUR: But do you think they're planning to make more nuclear weapons? What do you think they're trying to do? And again, if sanctions aren't working, what will?\n\nMULLEN: Well, the assumption certainly is, that they continue to head in the direction of additional nuclear weapons. And they're also -- they also are known to proliferate this technology.\n\nSo they're a very dangerous country. And -- and he has been someone who has not responded thus far to previous actions. He actually blows hot and cold. He moves in a direction for a while, and then he reverts, and I certainly would see him in his reversion mode at this particular point in time.\n\nAMANPOUR: And why didn't U.S. intelligence discover this?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I won't go into any...\n\nAMANPOUR: But isn't that alarming?\n\nMULLEN: I won't go into any specific intelligence kinds of things today, Christiane, but I would say that, you know, this is something we've been concerned about for a significant period of time, and also penetration of -- of the North Koreans, in terms of intelligence capabilities, is very, very difficult.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think China is the one to help you resolve this?\n\nMULLEN: I think China has...\n\nAMANPOUR: Will it?\n\nMULLEN: ... an awful lot to do with that. We've been engaged with China for an extended period of time with respect to North Korea. The president sent out a team to each of the capitals this weekend to re-engage, and so that's where we are right now, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. And a great part of this, I think, will have to be done through Beijing.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you worried about North Korea making more nuclear weapons right now with this facility? Is that what it's showing?\n\nMULLEN: I've been worried about North Korea and its potential nuclear capability for a long time. This certainly gives that potential real life, very visible life that we all ought to be very, very focused on.\n\nAMANPOUR: The president and the president of Russia have signed the New START treaty. This week, that has been sort of stopped, stopping START in the Senate by the number-two Republican senator there, Jon Kyl.\n\nCan I ask you -- I'm basically going to wave around a veritable \"who's who\" of Republican and Democratic former secretaries of state, of defense, all sorts of people who have been studying this for a long time and say that this has to be ratified. Does it have to be ratified? Is this necessary for U.S. national -- national security?\n\nMULLEN: I think this is -- more than anything else, it's a national security issue. I was involved extensively in the negotiations with my counterpart in Russia. We have for decades have had treaties with them to -- to be able to -- to verify aspects of the nuclear weapons capabilities that we both have. And from a national security perspective, this is absolutely critical.\n\nAMANPOUR: So when it comes to the military impact of this treaty, are you convinced that all the military issues have been dealt with and the United States would be no weaker or a in no worse place if this was ratified?\n\nMULLEN: Completely comfortable with where we are militarily, myself, the rest of the uniformed leadership, as well as the secretary of defense.\n\nAMANPOUR: And the intelligence agencies have signed off on all the verification procedures and measures? You're comfortable with that?\n\nMULLEN: Absolutely. The verification regime that exists in this is in ways better than the one that has existed in the past. Some criticize that there are fewer inspections; the arsenal is much smaller than it used to be. We are close to one year without any ability to verify what's going on in Russia.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you're comfortable with the amount of money that the president and the administration has pledged to modernize American nuclear arsenals?\n\nMULLEN: I have. I reviewed it -- I've reviewed it several times. And it is a very clear commitment to modernize the nuclear infrastructure in this country.\n\nAMANPOUR: So by a process of elimination, is the Senate playing politics with American national security?\n\nMULLEN: Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that.\n\nAMANPOUR: What do you think?\n\nMULLEN: Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be both recognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a national security issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done, the better.\n\nAMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: As soon as possible.\n\nAMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: Certainly, the potential is there for a lame-duck, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you would want that?\n\nMULLEN: I would -- that's the soonest possible time, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: And just so we're clear, why does one need Russia's cooperation today?\n\nMULLEN: I've worked hard, not just in this treaty, with my counterpart in Russia, and I've seen it up and down our government over the course of the last couple of years, and we've really taken significant steps, no better example than this weekend, where President Medvedev was actually in Lisbon with all of NATO supportive of a missile defense treaty -- I'm sorry, missile defense capability in the future. And a year or two ago, that just not would have been possible.\n\nThe Russians have supported us in Afghanistan, allowed us to transport some of our most significant equipment, where they could have pushed back on that.\n\nThey've also helped in other ways that wouldn't be widely known. So the relationship is maturing, very specifically, and it's one that's helped us in Iran. So they've -- so -- so there's been an awful lot tied into the improvement of this relationship.\n\nAMANPOUR: Not ratifying it, does that harm American credibility? For instance, many of the senators who are saying, no, let's not do it in this lame-duck session are the very ones who say we need to make sure that Iran doesn't proliferate nuclear material, we need to make sure, as we've just seen, that North Korea does not. How does this affect America's credibility when it comes to nonproliferation?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think President Obama said coming out of this NATO summit many of the leaders there spoke to him about the need to ratify this New START treaty, and certainly it's indicative of the commitment that many other countries have to us and the importance of getting it done.\n\nSo I'm certainly concerned about how -- and in particular, how we look and also this -- this emerging relationship with Russia and what it would mean to not do that. And they've clearly sent signals already with respect to that which haven't been positive.\n\nAMANPOUR: What signals?\n\nMULLEN: Just -- they've spoken to the need to get this done, the importance of it, and whether or not it would be tied to this relationship, given all that we've done in the course of the last couple of years.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's move on to Afghanistan, an area where you said that they have been cooperating. They've just said that they're going to offer more roots through their -- through their territory for material for NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nIn NATO, summit in Lisbon, talking now about a 2014 deadline for transferring combat responsibilities to the Afghan forces. I've also heard -- is that an absolute date?\n\nMULLEN: Yes, it is.\n\nAMANPOUR: Absolute?\n\nMULLEN: Yes, it is. It's one everybody signed up to.\n\nAMANPOUR: All combat operations will be handed over to Afghans at the end of 2014?\n\nMULLEN: I would describe it much like what we just went through in Iraq, where clearly they have the lead for their own security. We are then in some capacity, in a training, advising, and assist mode, which we would expect to be for some time, but in terms of combat operations, they would have the lead.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you see post-2014 just like we see in Iraq today?\n\nMULLEN: As best we can tell, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: Any more?\n\nMULLEN: Any more...\n\nAMANPOUR: ... troops, operations. I mean, I ask you, because right now, how many areas have even been transferred to Afghan control?\n\nMULLEN: Well, one of the things that happened -- one of the things that happened in Lisbon was the commitment to start to -- that transfer in the spring, and that will be based on conditions on the ground and a recommendation from General Petraeus, literally district by district. So it's a significant commitment to start that this spring.\n\nAgain, it really is a situation where -- where the Afghans then lead, specifically in terms of their own security, and we think that's absolutely critical, and that they'll be capable of starting to be able to do that this spring.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, your own officers say, in fact, even in the least combative areas of Afghanistan, that it could take something like 18 months to 24 months to complete a transfer to Afghan lead, in terms of security. Can they really, do you believe, take over security within four years?\n\nMULLEN: I do believe, as best we understand things right now, that that's very much a reachable goal. There's a lot to do between now and then, clearly. Very dangerous place, very tough fight we're in right now. We certainly understand that.\n\nBut that's a goal actually that President Karzai set out there and that all NATO allies -- actually, all countries who are providing forces -- because there are some 20 other countries doing that -- have signed up to, and we think it's reachable.\n\nAMANPOUR: In order to do that, it looks like the situation on the ground is shifting. In other words, that there is a huge spike in raids, whether it be drones on the Pakistan area, whether it be trying to kill as many Taliban as possible on the ground in Afghanistan. Is that what's happening now?\n\nMULLEN: We knew this year would be a particularly difficult year because of all the added troops that we put in, among other things. And it has been. And I would expect next year to be a very difficult year, as well.\n\nThat said, the -- the security situation has started to change. It has started to get better -- better. We've sacrificed greatly, tragic losses, far too many always, but we've also succeeded in starting to reverse the momentum. I think General Petraeus calls it we've arrested the momentum in some specific places...\n\nAMANPOUR: But he said it's not irreversible.\n\nMULLEN: No, it isn't irreversible, and it's still fragile. That's really where we are right now in this fight.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, given that fact, as you put it, what is the relationship with President Karzai, which seems to be basically all over the place on any given day? What does he say now about night raids?\n\nMULLEN: Well, he's -- I think, obviously, most recently, he's spoken to his concerns about that. The piece that you ran earlier speaks to a huge issue, which is the issue of civilian casualties, but it also speaks to a point that was -- is oftentimes not clearly articulated, which is the Taliban are killing about 9 or 10 times more civilians than -- than our forces are. And we are making extraordinary efforts to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nWe recognize President Karzai's concern with respect to night raids and some of the other concerns that he has, and we are doing all we can. There has to be a balance here, very specifically.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me move quickly over to Yemen. Al Qaida brazenly puts out a statement today, yesterday saying that this is our tactic, bombs that cost $4,000-plus, a raid against all your multibillions of security in counterterrorism. Are they going to succeed with one of these cargo plane bombs?\n\nMULLEN: Well, there's an awful lot of effort going on to make sure that they don't. And...\n\nAMANPOUR: Doesn't that worry you?\n\nMULLEN: You bet it worries me. And I give credit to a lot of people to -- at this point in time that -- that they haven't been able to pull something like this off, because it's a very serious threat, and I believe what they are saying. They've grown, it's dangerous, and it's a place we need to focus.\n\nAMANPOUR: \"Don't ask\/don't tell,\" something that's hugely important right now. A draft report has come to you; some 70 percent of the military say that it will either have a beneficial or nonexistent effect. Do you think it needs to be voted on in this lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I won't speak to what the draft report says. We'll have this report done here...\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think...\n\nMULLEN: ... and to Secretary Gates in the next couple of weeks, by December 1st, and I won't make any comments on where I think we need to go until that report is done.\n\nAMANPOUR: You support it, though, repealing \"don't ask\/don't tell\"?\n\nMULLEN: From my personal perspective, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: Because?\n\nMULLEN: Because I think it -- it belies us as an institution. We value integrity as an institution.\n\nAMANPOUR: You mean forcing them to lie about what they are?\n\nMULLEN: And then -- and then asking individuals to come in and lie about who they are every day goes counter to who we are as an institution.\n\nAMANPOUR: Apart from the integrity issue, many of your allies -- whether it be England or Canada or France or Australia, the Israeli army -- they have openly gay servicemembers in their military with no adverse effects.\n\nMULLEN: Certainly. I've seen that, and that is very much a part of this review, and we'll incorporate that into the review and recommendations which go up the chain.\n\nAMANPOUR: So were you angry with the new Marine commandant when he cast his own doubts over this and criticized it?\n\nMULLEN: He had made his position very clear in testimony. What concerned me about his most recent comments, it came at a time where we actually had the draft report in hand, and we had all agreed that we would speak to this privately until we completed the report and made our recommendations up the chain.\n\nAMANPOUR: And if it does not get voted on in the lame-duck session, is there any chance that it will come up in any reasonable time period afterwards?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I mean, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen. Obviously, from a legislative...\n\nAMANPOUR: But would you think it will put it down the road?\n\nMULLEN: ... from a legislative perspective. The other piece that is out there that's very real is the courts are very active on this. And my concern is that at some point in time the courts could change this law and in that not give us the right amount of time to implement it. I think it's much better done -- if it's going to get done, it's much better done through legislature than it is out of the courts.\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen, thank you very much indeed for joining us.\n\nMULLEN: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: And the roundtable is next, with George Will, Robert Reich, Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce from the Financial Times.\n\nAnd also, later, a report from Haiti on the cholera outbreak. Has the country been abandoned again?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): Whoa.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yes. Pull. Dang it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Missed it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Bristol the Pistol, you fired a few blanks during the week, but tonight all guns blazing.\n\nWALTERS: If you ran for president, could you beat Barack Obama?\n\nPALIN: I believe so.\n\nBIDEN: She's always underestimated, so, you know, I think -- I think I shouldn't say any more.\n\n(UNKNOWN): There you go.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: A big week for Sarah Palin, one of the topics for our roundtable with George Will, Robert Reich, author of \"Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future,\" Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times.\n\nAnd I want to start with our interview with Mike Mullen. We're clearly going to get to Sarah Palin. What do you think? Admiral Mullen could barely be constrained from saying that he thought this was political, this holdup.\n\nREICH: I thought it was very interesting, Christiane. I mean, when you asked him that question, he was very, very tempted -- you could almost read his mind -- to say that, look, Jon Kyl is taking direction from Mitch McConnell, who says explicitly that the next two years are going to be about making sure that Barack Obama is not a two-term president. And, therefore, this is all politics, and therefore, the Republicans are putting politics above national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, on an issue like this, they can't do that, can they? I mean, really, he ticked off the military, the intelligence, the financial; all the questions that they had have been resolved.\n\nWILL: I take Jon Kyl at his word, and I respect him very much. I think what he says is, first of all, it's nonsense to say, as Joe Biden, the gift who keeps on giving does say, that it is -- the vital national security interest of the United States is to ratify this in a lame-duck session? That means that if we didn't have a lame-duck session, which we shouldn't do ever, the nation would be...\n\nAMANPOUR: But the vital interest is to ratify it right now, as soon as possible.\n\nWILL: As opposed to six weeks from now? Oh, please.\n\nAMANPOUR: But it -- but it looks like it would be put off, even if it was -- they want more debate. They want to reopen it, talk about it again.\n\nWILL: Jon Kyl is bargaining for the modernization of our nuclear force.\n\nAMANPOUR: So it's about money?\n\nWILL: Can I give you -- that's part -- it's about the modernization of our force. Can I give you Will's law of arms control? Arm's control is impossible until it's unimportant. This is unimportant, so it's going to get done. That is, who lies awake at night worrying about the size, not the security, but the size of the Russian nuclear arsenal? No one.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you're partly right there, because the size is not the main issue. It's the verification, which is a huge issue, and, vitally, American credibility. Here we have this story from North Korea today -- how does America stand up and say, \"You guys can't proliferate,\" if we're not going to do this? How can we lead?\n\nLUCE: Very, very difficult. I mean, Russia, of course, is a part of the six-party group with North Korea, and therefore its cooperation is also important there, as it is on Afghanistan, as it is on Iran.\n\nThese broader implications for failing to ratify START here go across the world. Russia's cooperation is something that Obama has worked on very successfully, very patiently, along with Hillary Clinton, for two years now, and this puts it in jeopardy.\n\nJust one other point, though, about Mitch McConnell's pledge to make Obama a one-term president. Clearly, that's going to be the strategy of the Republicans. Question is, are they going to do it intelligently or unintelligently? And I think Senator Kyl, his comments and his stance, indicate it could well be the latter.\n\nBRAZILE: Senator Kyl a year ago, after returning from Geneva, called upon the Senate to quickly ratify this treaty. Now, what has happened in one year? What has happened, clearly, is that the Republicans have redoubled their efforts to block anything that President Obama would like to see passed. They want to deny him a victory.\n\nThis is political malpractice. And Senator Kyl said that himself. So it might be -- George is probably correct. This might be about money, to get more money for the nuclear industry complex. The president has promised $4 billion more, but in all...\n\nAMANPOUR: In addition to $80 billion.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right. But in all of the hearings this year and all of the conversations, Senator Kyl, no one else, you know, expressed any objections, and now this is, I think, one of those political moments where they can succeed in blocking the president.\n\nREICH: You know, there were 21 separate hearings and briefings. I mean, this is not something that is being put suddenly on the agenda. And for Kyl to say right now we just don't have time or this is -- there's not enough money I think defies logic.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, again, as Admiral Mullen said, it's not just a nice treaty with a foreign country. It is about Russia's cooperation on all the issues that the United States needs, whether it's Afghanistan, Iran, and all the rest of it.\n\nPlus, I don't know what you think, but some are saying that this could give rise to the hard-liners in Russia again, who just do not want to -- who just don't want to deal with the United States.\n\nLUCE: Oh, absolutely. I think it's -- it's a dream -- if you picked two countries that would like to see a failure of ratification, it would be North Korea and Iran. And I think that -- if that argument doesn't work with the Republicans, that sort of basic elemental national security argument doesn't work, nothing is. There's -- there's a greater hatred of Obama than there is a love of American national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's switch right back to here and economic security. G.M. today this week had success, initial public offering. The bailout worked? The saving G.M. worked?\n\nREICH: Well, it worked, Christiane, to the extent that, indeed, G.M. is now worth $50 billion, if you believe the stock market, and before, in the old G.M., was worth $25 billion.\n\nBut what happened during the bailout? Actually, it was a -- it -- it was not so much a bailout as it was a reorganization under bankruptcy, and they got rid of $80 billion of debt, they got rid of thousands of jobs, divisions that were not functioning. Wall Streeters came in and reorganized G.M.\n\nWhy do we suppose the exact same thing would not have happened under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganization? It's not clear that the $50 billion of taxpayer money was necessary.\n\nWILL: Of course, we'll get it back, unless their share price goes to $55 and they sell 500 million shares of the stock.\n\nDon't believe a word G.M. says. Remember that last April their CEO, in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, and then echoing in television commercials, said G.M. has paid back the bailout in full. It paid back a tiny sliver of it, and it paid it back with government funds from another account. So do not listen to G.M.\n\nAMANPOUR: Don't listen to a word G.M. says?\n\nLUCE: I -- I find that difficult to disagree with. I would, however, say just in defense of the Treasury's handling of this IPO that there is not an IPO in the world that -- not a privatization in the world that isn't controversial, that hasn't been criticized for being underpriced or overpriced or misallocated. And in this case, clearly, they're going to have to see an increase in the share price to get the taxpayer money fully back.\n\nBRAZILE: We saved a critical part of the American manufacturing base, and that's -- that's good news during this Thanksgiving week.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, indeed, Warren Buffett, who knows a bit about business, has written an op-ed this last week to -- \"To Uncle Sam, thank you from your grateful nephew, Warren, for actually saving the economy.\" Do you give the administration any credit for that?\n\nREICH: Yes, certainly. And the economy would be much worse were it not for everything the administration has done. But, again, it's hard to prove a negative. It's very, very difficult right now.\n\nWe look at the degree of anger and upset still there in the American economy, on Main Street. The Washington Post ran a survey not long ago showing that 53 percent of homeowners -- 53 percent -- are worried about paying their mortgage.\n\nNow, this may be a good economy for Wall Street, it may be a good economy for the IPOs, it may be a good economy for the people in the top 1 percent whose assets are in financial instruments, but this is not a good economy yet for most people.\n\nAMANPOUR: The economy is showing still slow signs of coming back. The job numbers keep getting incrementally better, but not enough to affect the 9.6 percent. Was it -- is it -- is it actually going to help?\n\nLUCE: The G.M. IPO? Well, I mean, I think...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, and the -- and the -- the measures, as Warren Buffett said, that helped keep the economy from diving.\n\nLUCE: Yes, but they're all in the system. They're out there. Nothing more other than what Ben Bernanke and the Fed is doing is going to be available in this political climate. And whether that will be enough to help, I think there are grounds for deep skepticism. I do think we're looking at a Japan-style situation here of low growth or at least the threat of that.\n\nOne thing I'd say about the G.M. IPO, just to back up Donna, is the counterfactual here. If G.M. had been -- had gone bankrupt and large portions of it had been closed down, we could have lost several hundred thousand jobs. The exaggerated number of 1 million might be too high.\n\nThe administration's communications effort on this has been absolutely abysmal. It's quite extraordinary to me how they haven't put this forward more forcefully and -- and how the public still doesn't see just how different a kind of bailout this was than the Wall Street bailouts, which remain deservedly unpopular.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me just play what Warren Buffett told us about taxes. Obviously, this is going to come up in this session of Congress, the Bush-era taxes, which either have to be extended or not. This is what he said about it.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBUFFETT: I think that people at the high end, people like myself, should be paying a lot more in taxes. We have it better than we've ever had it.\n\nAMANPOUR: They say you have to keep those tax cuts even on the very wealthy because that is what energizes business and capitalism.\n\nBUFFETT: The rich are always going to say that, you know, \"Just give us more money, and we'll go out and spend more, and then it will all trickle down to the rest of you.\" But that has not worked the last 10 years, and I hope the American public is catching on.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So what do you think is going to happen? Where will the compromise be? What is the tax situation going to look like?\n\nWILL: I think we can all come together on raising Warren Buffett's taxes. He wants to pay more? Let's -- let's do it.\n\nAMANPOUR: He wants to. He wants to.\n\nWILL: Of course. All billionaires say it's of marginal importance...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: ... in -- in -- in Seattle, by the Gates Foundation...\n\nWILL: But if you're asking, in the aftermath of November 2nd, are the fellows up there going to come in and raise taxes? No. And by the way, on one of the tax -- the favorite new taxes of the wonk class in this town is a value-added tax. They forget that last April the Senate voted on this, in a non-binding resolution. It voted 83-13 to disapprove of value-added tax.\n\nREICH: You know, even in this town, that seems inured to hypocrisy, for the Republicans in Congress to say, \"We must have a tax break, we must extend the Bush tax breaks for the top earners, but at the same time, we don't have enough money, we cannot, because of the deficit, extend the unemployment insurance for working Americans who have been out of work in record numbers, long-term unemployed,\" gets some sort of an award for hypocrisy. I mean, this is absurd on its face.\n\nAMANPOUR: I want to raise the issue of Sarah Palin. She's had a big week, as we've been saying. Let's just play what she told Barbara Walters, which will air on Barbara Walters' thanksgiving special.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPALIN: I'm looking at the lay of the land now and trying to figure that out, if it's a good thing for the country, for the discourse, for my family, if it's a good thing.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, that was about whether she was going to run for president, and she was subsequently asked by Barbara, \"If you ran against Barack Obama, could you win?\" And she said, \"I think I might be able to.\" Is she going to run?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, any time you say you have to check with your family, that's always in my judgment a euphemism that, \"I'm running.\" Look, she has a lot of commercial activity yet to sell before she actually tosses her gloves in the ring. She has a book to promote; she has a TV show. I'm sure George is going to stay up tonight to watch it, George.\n\nAMANPOUR: George?\n\nWILL: I'll pass.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: And she has Fox News. So she has -- unlike other -- the other candidates that have to go out there and build up their name ID, Sarah Palin has a strong name identification.\n\nBut once she decides to run for president -- for the presidency, all things are off the table, all of this celebrity. She has to begin to put together policy papers. She has to put together an organization. And while it might look good, might look good to think about it, it's very tough to run for president of the United States.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think she will?\n\nWILL: No. Well, no, I don't think she will, partly because the very people that decide our elections, the independent voters, have made up their mind about her, and it's a negative judgment they've made.\n\nAfter the 2008 campaign, she had two things she had to do. She had to go home to Alaska and study, and she had to govern Alaska well. Instead, she quit halfway through her first term and shows up in the audience of \"Dancing with the Stars\" and other distinctly non-presidential venues.\n\nAMANPOUR: Where her daughter is participating.\n\nWILL: Where her daughter is participating.\n\nAMANPOUR: A mother's support.\n\nWILL: Pardon?\n\nAMANPOUR: A mother's support.\n\nWILL: It's stirring family values, but not it's good training to be president.\n\nAMANPOUR: How does the world look at a Sarah Palin run in 2012?\n\nLUCE: With deep horror, I think, but also some amusement. I think there's a -- there's a trope out there that this is the best scenario possible for Barack Obama.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me -- let me just play devil's advocate. The midterms were characterized by the rise and the power of the Tea Party. Sarah Palin is a big backer, the godmother, the supporter. She -- she made quite a lot of inroads. Many of her candidates, the majority actually won. Why is this so -- so strange that she might win -- run?\n\nREICH: You know, Christiane, I want to support your -- and I think it's actually more than simply raising the question here. Sarah Palin is not only a realistic candidate right now, but given the degree of anger in the electorate, anti-establishment anger, populist anger, she's the only candidate to come along who actually embodies that anger.\n\nThis is not the ebullience and hopefulness of Ronald Reagan. This is not \"Morning in America.\" This is the anger of people who feel that they're being screwed by the establishment.\n\nAMANPOUR: And talk about...\n\nREICH: And she is, I think -- look, I'm not going to make any predictions, but I think that she does not have a negligible chance of becoming president.\n\nBRAZILE: Run, Sarah. I think she should run to upset the Republican establishment. I think she should run to show the country that, yes, in an era where men still dominate, that women can still run.\n\nOf course, I disagree with all her policy positions, but I hope that she would shock the Washington Republican establishment and go out there, build a kind of organization, begin to put together some realistic issues that can -- she can present to the American people. I don't think she will have an easy time beating President Obama, but it will be an interesting year.\n\nAMANPOUR: And on anger...\n\nLUCE: If you look...\n\nAMANPOUR: Yeah, go ahead?\n\nLUCE: If you look at her book itinerary, Iowa and South Carolina feature very prominently, so there's certainly going to be an overlap there, if she -- if she wants to run. She's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Last topic, TSA. Quick point, the anger here -- we're talking about anger -- the anger -- and yet 80 percent of the American people say they would go through those full body X-rays. Are we making a big deal about this?\n\nLUCE: I hate to be facetious, but I'd be quite flattered if somebody wanted to see me naked.\n\nAMANPOUR: That is facetious.\n\nBRAZILE: The X-rays are fine. I've been through full body X-rays. It's -- it's the intimacy of the new touching procedures that sort of rattled my -- my cage a little bit. The man said, \"Don't mess with my junk\"? Well, don't open my jewels. Don't...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: Yes, it's very personal. But I don't mind a full body scan. Just don't show my pictures without paying me.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nREICH: I think -- I think the problem here is that there's been so much time since the Christmas bomber -- and people don't remember -- Americans are willing to sacrifice privacy if they can connect it up with a specific incidence -- incident where national security is compromised. And I think -- the Christmas bomber was last Christmas.\n\nAMANPOUR: You're going to continue this in the green room, where the roundtable will continue at abcnews.com\/thisweek, where you can also find our fact checks in conjunction with PolitiFact.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we turn now to Haiti and the virulent strain of cholera that has just arrived here in the United States. In the past few weeks, it's killed more than 1,100 people in Haiti and hospitalized 17,000. Haitians hold their general election next Sunday, but on the streets this week, violent demonstrations were directed against United Nations troops who are suspected of bringing the disease to the country.\n\nIt's been almost a year since the world pledged to rebuild Haiti after that devastating earthquake, and that has not happened. Here's ABC's Matt Gutman reporting from Port-au-Prince, the capital.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nGUTMAN (voice-over): They are dying in the streets here. These sanitation crews treat the bodies and truck them to the morgue, which has already reached capacity. The government's failure to deal with the outbreak and rumors that the United Nations spread the contagion fueled riots all week, violence the U.N. alleges is political.\n\nFISHER: In Cap-Haitien, there have been demonstrations which have stopped us doing our work for cholera victims, and those on the political side say they know that these are demonstrations that were planned. They weren't spontaneous.\n\nGUTMAN: This is election season in Haiti, traditionally a period of unrest. In the meantime, supplies to treat the living are chronically short.\n\nWOOD: This stuff here, it's cheap, and life is not. If you look around here today, these people would all be dead if it weren't for this.\n\nGUTMAN (on-screen): You're not getting enough of it?\n\nWOOD: Yeah, and we're -- and getting enough of it. That's right.\n\nGUTMAN (voice-over): Dr. Tom Wood has been treating cholera for decades. This is one of the worst outbreaks he's seen.\n\nWOOD: You know, God help us.\n\nGUTMAN: He weeps for all this misery and for the fact that there needn't be so much of it. Sean Penn runs a relief organization here.\n\n(on-screen): Americans have donated over a billion dollars for this cause. Just a fraction of it has been used. Where is it? What's the holdup?\n\nPENN: Well, there's -- there's the -- what the American people need to know is that the fraction that's being used is in the administration of the overhead of those organizations that are -- that have been tasked with administering that money.\n\nGUTMAN (voice-over): The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund has received over $50 million in donations; it has spent only a fraction of it here. American aid groups quietly blame Haiti's inability to absorb the aid, partly because of the scale of the damage here, but also because of the government's ineptitude.\n\nBut there's also corruption. Supplies rot at the port where this mountain of containers grows. Aid groups blame customs officials.\n\n(on-screen): ... just want to get a couple of answers about how things work, how merchandise moves out of the port, and how you release it.\n\n(voice-over): ... held up the release of trucks and equipment for months, medicine for days.\n\n(on-screen): These people don't have one or two or three days. They will die if they don't get this.\n\nWOOD: They will -- they will die without this.\n\nGUTMAN: This World Health Organization warehouse is essentially Haiti's central pharmacy. Now, there's probably enough medication here to treat everybody in the country who has cholera. Getting it to them, though, is much more difficult.\n\nWOOD: The U.N. says is that, you know, go through this paperwork, sign that piece of paperwork, go see that government official, and in the meantime, people die.\n\nGUTMAN: And epidemiologists are telling us they'll continue to die. Hundreds of thousands are expected to become infected over the coming weeks and months.\n\nMatt Gutman, ABC News, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And joining me this morning is ABC's chief health and medical editor, Dr. Richard Besser, formerly of the Centers for Disease Control, and he was recently in Haiti.\n\nSo, Dr. Besser, thanks for joining us this morning. I think, first and foremost, how big a threat of spread is this cholera outbreak, both to the United States and to the surrounding region?\n\nBESSER: Well, one of the critical things to know about cholera is that 75 percent of those -- of the people who are infected will have absolutely no symptoms, so they're able to take the bacteria and bring it to another country.\n\nIn a country like the United States, where there's clean water and adequate sanitation, the likelihood of spread is very, very remote, unless it's introduced into a migrant camp or place that didn't have adequate water.\n\nThe Caribbean, though, is a different story, and it's likely that there will be cases introduced to the Caribbean. Whether or not they spread, whether or not they set up shop like they have done in Haiti will depend on the quality of water and sanitation in those countries.\n\nAMANPOUR: And in terms of trying to get it under control in Haiti, we saw in the report that basic, you know, saline solution or rehydration and water is not getting to the people as fast as possible. How and what do they need?\n\nBESSER: Well, you know, cholera is one of the most rewarding diseases to treat. If you get to someone early in the disease, you give them oral rehydration or I.V. fluids, they're going to recover. One dose of antibiotic will kill the bacteria. If you don't, though, if you don't get those critical fluids to people quickly, they can die in less than a day.\n\nI was in Bangladesh last week and was watching how they treat it in the cholera hospital there. And it was like a machine. They had this down to a science.\n\nIn Haiti, the numbers coming out are very, very alarming. Ten times the number of people who should be dying from cholera are dying from it. That's a good sign that people are not getting treated quickly enough, that the solutions are not getting to people in time to save those lives.\n\nAMANPOUR: And in terms of the billions of dollars that have been pledged to Haiti, not all of them have got there, but can actually something happen to improve this situation without a real infrastructure improvement, without development?\n\nBESSER: Well, you know, the long-term solution is infrastructure. It's providing water treatment plants. It's repairing those plants that were broken.\n\nBut if you look at Haiti before the earthquake, the numbers there were really not good at all. Only 12 percent of the population had piped water into their house that was clean. Only 17 percent of the population used adequate sanitation.\n\nSo this earthquake did not hit a situation where you had a country with viable public health infrastructure that need to be repaired. It hit a country that was really at bottom level, a country that did not have infrastructure to begin with.\n\nAnd the critical thing for Haiti is, can they build a public health infrastructure that works? In the meantime, it's going down to the basics. It's providing water storage containers and home chlorination, with tablets or dilute bleach. That can provide safe drinking water, but it takes a lot to sustain that effort.\n\nAMANPOUR: Dr. Besser, thanks, indeed, for joining us this morning, and we'll keep watching it. Thank you.\n\nAnd next week, we have a special program for you. They are economic titans, innovators, and risk-takers, now giving their billions back. Next Sunday, my exclusive interviews with Bill and Melinda Gates, Ted Turner, and Warren Buffett in a rare Sunday morning appearance.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBUFFETT: I just think the idea of dynastic wealth is kind of crazy.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): What motivates them to give up so much?\n\nTURNER: It is scary, because everybody is always afraid that they're going to go broke.\n\nAMANPOUR: What they predict for the future of the United States.\n\nB. GATES: The question for us is, are we educating people well?\n\nAMANPOUR: And their solutions to the current economic challenges.\n\n(on-screen): Does there need to be a sense of sacrifice in the United States?\n\n(voice-over): Buffett, Gates and Turner, their giving pledge, a special \"This Week\" next Sunday.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)",

    "text":"Newseum\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n12:03 P.M. EDT\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Good afternoon from Washington, D.C. I'm John Harwood. It is noon on the East Coast. The Dow Jones average stands around 10,700 points; 15 million Americans are out of work. And we're spending the next hour talking about how to fix the troubled American economy.\n\nPlease welcome the President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, thanks for being here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That was quite a lead-in, by the way. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Yes, wasn\u2019t it? You like that dramatic pause? (Laughter.) We have got a cross-section of people from around the country -- CEOs, union workers, teachers and students --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a good-looking group, I have to say. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: -- small business owners, people who don't have a job. Every one of them has a stake in the American Dream. And they got some good news over the weekend. The National Bureau of Economic Research, as you know, has said that the recession ended in June 2009 -- a few months after you took office. And yet here\u2019s the problem you find yourself with. Many leaders in business think you and your policies are hostile to them. And many ordinary Americans think your policies are helping Wall Street and big business. How did that happen?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, even though economists may say that the recession officially ended last year, obviously for the millions of people who are still out of work, people who have seen their home values decline, people who are struggling to pay the bills day to day, it\u2019s still very real for them.\n\nAnd I think we have to go back to what was happening when I was first sworn in as the 44th President of the United States. We went through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Nothing has come close. In fact, if you look at the consequences of the recession in the \u201880s, the recession in the \u201890s, and the recession in 2001, and you combine all three of those, it still wasn\u2019t as bad as this recession that we went through.\n\nSo the month I was sworn in we lost 750,000 jobs; the month after that 600,000; the month after that 600,000. This is before any of our plans had a chance to take effect. The financial markets were on the verge of meltdown and the economy was contracting about 6 percent -- by far, the largest contraction we've seen since the \u201830s.\n\nYou combine all that and what that meant was that we had to take some steps very quickly just to make sure that the financial system was not collapsing -- that people could get auto loans, could get student loans, that businesses large and small could get some financing to keep their doors open and to keep their payrolls on track. And in addition, we had to make sure that we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression.\n\nNow, we've done that. Those programs that we put in place worked. So now you\u2019ve got a financial system that is stable. It\u2019s still not as strong as it was back in 2006, 2007, but it is stabilized. You\u2019ve got now eight consecutive months of private sector job growth. Businesses are able to borrow again; they\u2019re investing again; they\u2019re making profits again.\n\nThat's all the good news. The challenge is, is that the hole was so deep that a lot of people out there are still hurting -- and probably some folks here in the audience are still having a tough time. (Applause.) And so the question then becomes what can we now put in place to make sure that the trend lines continue in a positive direction, as opposed to going back in the negative direction.\n\nLast week we got some good news. After fighting for several months, we finally got a small business tax cut bill in place so that we\u2019re eliminating capital gains for small businesses and startups, making sure that they can get loans -- because small businesses are the ones that have been hardest hit in terms of not being able to get capital. We have put forward proposals, for example, to accelerate investment here in the United States instead of overseas in research and development and plants and equipment that could put people back to work.\n\nSo there are a lot of plans in place that can make improvement, but it\u2019s slow and steady, as opposed to the kind of quick fix that I think a lot of people would like to see. But the thing I\u2019ve just got to remind people of is the fact that it took us a decade to get into the problem that we\u2019re in right now.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal came out with a report based on Census information that the years from 2001 to 2009, the middle class actually saw their wages decline by 5 percent. This was before the financial crisis. So these have been some long-term trends of the middle class having a lot of problems out there. And what we\u2019ve got to do now it to reverse it, but something that took 10 years to create is going to take a little more time to solve.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: I\u2019ve heard you give that turnaround message you just gave many times.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right, right.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let me ask about your assessment of the challenge and the problem in communicating that to the American people. We all identify with people like ourselves. Do you think it\u2019s possible that because of your style, or the unusual things about your background -- your racial heritage, where you grew up, Ivy League education -- that the fearful voters who are about to go to the polls in November think, yes, I hear him, he may get it intellectually, but he doesn\u2019t feel what I\u2019m feeling?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here\u2019s my suspicion. I think that when the unemployment rate is still high and people are having a tough time, it doesn\u2019t matter if I was green -- (laughter) -- it doesn\u2019t matter if I was purple. I think people would still be frustrated, and understandably so.\n\nLook, I can describe what\u2019s happening to the economy overall, but if you\u2019re out of work right now, the only thing that you\u2019re going to be hearing is, when do I get a job? (Applause.) If you\u2019re about to lose your home, all you\u2019re thinking about is, when can I get my home?\n\nSo I don\u2019t think that those are the issues. And by the way, I think most people understand -- because I spent two years running around the country talking about my life and why I was running for President -- they understand that I was the kid of a single mom, and I got my education through scholarships, and I lived in a small apartment with my grandparents, and they were helped by the G.I. Bill and FHA in terms of being able to climb into the middle class.\n\nThe whole reason I ran was because my life is a testimony to the American Dream. And everything that we\u2019ve been doing since I came into office is designed to make sure that that American Dream continues for future generations.\n\nI think the challenge right now is that I\u2019m thinking about the next generation and there are a lot of folks out there who are thinking about the next election. If I were making decisions based on November, then I wouldn\u2019t have done some of the things that I did because I knew they weren\u2019t popular. But they were the right thing to do. And that's got to be my top priority. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let\u2019s go to the real jury who will decide whether they were the right things to do with an audience question right here.\n\nQ Thank you very much and, quite frankly, good afternoon, President Obama. I am deeply honored to finally be in this forum, and so grateful for CNBC making the forum available so that you can speak to American citizens just like myself.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you.\n\nQ I am a chief financial officer for a veterans service organization, AmVets here in Washington. I\u2019m also a mother, I\u2019m a wife, I\u2019m an American veteran, and I\u2019m one of your middle-class Americans. And quite frankly, I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nQ -- and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.\n\nI have been told that I voted for a man who said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class. I\u2019m one of those people, and I\u2019m waiting, sir. I\u2019m waiting. I don't feel it yet. And I thought, while it wouldn\u2019t be in great measure, I would feel it in some small measure.\n\nI have two children in private school. And the financial recession has taken an enormous toll on my family. My husband and I joked for years that we thought we were well beyond the hot dogs and beans era of our lives.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nQ But quite frankly, it\u2019s starting to knock on our door and ring true that that might be where we\u2019re headed again. And quite frankly, Mr. President, I need you to answer this honestly, is this my new reality?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think that you describe exactly what is the bedrock of America -- a veteran who\u2019s working for veterans, somebody who is a CFO and I am sure knows how to manage their money, have made good decisions.\n\nQ Sometimes. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not saying once in a while you don't want to get a new pair of shoes. (Laughter.)\n\nQ Today. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So the life you describe -- one of responsibility, looking after your family, contributing back to your community -- that's what we want to reward.\n\nNow, as I said before, times are tough for everybody right now, so I understand your frustration. But I would just -- when you say there are things that you\u2019d like to see happen or you\u2019re hoping to see happen that haven\u2019t happened yet, let me just give you a couple of examples.\n\nI right now have two children -- it sounds like you\u2019ve got kids, as well.\n\nQ Two girls.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Two girls. You\u2019re going to be thinking about college soon.\n\nQ Next year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay. Now part of what we did over the last year and a half is to make sure that billions of dollars that were going to subsidize financial service industries under the federal student loan programs are now going to be going directly to students so that millions more students are going to be able to get loans and grants and scholarships to go to college. Now, that's going to have an impact on a whole bunch of kids out there, including maybe yours.\n\nIf you have a credit card, which I assume, you do --\n\nQ No.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, see, now you\u2019re really -- now you\u2019ve shown how responsible you are. (Laughter.) But if you have a mortgage or a credit card or any kind of financial dealings out there, as a consequence of the changes we made, the credit card companies can\u2019t increase your interest rate without notifying you, and they can\u2019t increase your interest rate on your previous balances. In terms of getting a mortgage, they -- you can\u2019t have a mortgage broker steer you to a mortgage that ultimately is going to cost you more money, because maybe they\u2019re getting a financial incentive to do so. Those things are now against the law. So there are a whole host of protections in there.\n\nYou are a parent who has children -- if your child, heaven forbid, had a preexisting condition, before I took office, you were out of luck in terms of being able to get health insurance for that child. Now, insurance companies have to give you health insurance for that child, and by the way, that health insurance can\u2019t drop you if you get sick.\n\nSo there are a whole host of things that we\u2019ve put in place that do make your life better. But the bottom line is if your 401(K) is still down substantially from where it was a while back, if you haven\u2019t seen a raise in a long time, if your home value went down --\n\nQ Keep going. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- depending on where you live, all those things still make you feel like, gosh, I\u2019m treading water.\n\nQ Still struggling -- that's right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And so my goal here is not to try to convince you that everything is where it needs to be. It\u2019s not. That's why I ran for President. But what I am saying is, is that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. And if we are able to keep our eye on our long-term goal -- which is making sure that every family out there, if they\u2019re middle class, that they can pay their bills, have the security of health insurance, retire with dignity and respect, send their kids to college; if they\u2019re not yet in the middle class, that there are ladders there to get into the middle class, if people work hard and get an education to apply themselves -- that's our goal. That's the America we believe in. And I think that we are on track to be able to do that.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me go at this from a different direction, from the direction of psychology, business confidence. You just mentioned things that credit card companies and health insurance companies used to do. There are some people in business who think, to use a phrase that you used recently about your critics, who think you talk about them like dogs. Let\u2019s listen to Ken Langone, a billionaire businessman.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, billionaire businessman?\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay.\n\n(Video is shown.)\n\nMR. LANGONE: What should they stop doing? Well, I think the one thing to do is to not make people in business feel like we\u2019re villains or criminals or doing something wrong. I think anytime we can create a job that puts somebody to work, the country is better served. So I think that there\u2019s got to be a need to understand that America, our democracy, is based on a strong, vibrant private economy.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Are you vilifying business?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, let\u2019s look at the track record here. When I came into office, businesses, some of the same commentators who are on CNBC, were crying, \u201cDo something,\u201d -- because as a consequence of reckless decisions that had been made, the economy was on the verge of collapse. Those same businesses now are profitable. The financial markets are stabilized. We haven\u2019t increased taxes on businesses. Actually, we have instituted about 50 tax cuts, many of them going to businesses large and small.\n\nAnd so the only thing that we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re not doing some of the same things that we were doing in the past that got us into this mess in the first place.\n\nSo when I mentioned, for example, changes in the financial services industry, it is very important for us not to find ourselves in a position in which banks get too big to fail, and if they make bad decisions taxpayers have to bail them out or we let the entire economy collapse. That\u2019s not a choice that I want any future President to have to make. And we instituted those changes.\n\nAnd the fact is that when FDR put in place deposit insurance in banks, banks said at the time, this is going to destroy capitalism. When Medicare was instituted, there were a whole bunch of people who said, this is socialized medicine. Now we take it for granted. But oftentimes there\u2019s this response that somehow these modest reforms that make the free market work better for consumers and for workers as well as for businesses, on the front end are resisted.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let me take it, though, to a level that's beyond policy and it goes to what you value and you don't value.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Sure.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: I think some of those in business may think that deep down you think that working for profit is morally inferior to the kind of work you used to do as a community organizer. Is that how you feel?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, it isn\u2019t. Look, in every speech, every interview that I've made, I've constantly said that what sets America apart, what has made us successful over the long term, is we've got the most dynamic free market economy in the world. And that has to be preserved. That has to be preserved. We benefit from entrepreneurs and innovators who are going out there and creating jobs, creating businesses.\n\nGovernment can't create the majority of jobs. And in fact, we want to get out of the way of folks who\u2019ve got a great idea and want to run with it and are going to be putting people to work.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Maybe we've got one of those people right here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'd love to hear from him.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. I'm 30 years old. I recently graduated from law school. And I went back to law school in order to pursue a life of public service, like you have. And what I found was that I simply -- there aren't jobs out there right now. I took advantage of the loans that you were just speaking about, but I can't make the interest payments on those loans today, let alone think about getting a mortgage, having a family, having even a marriage -- it\u2019s awfully expensive. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to comment on that. (Laughter and applause.) Let me just say that whatever the expense, it\u2019s worth it. (Laughter.) I want that on record. (Applause.)\n\nQ Like a lot of people in my generation, I was really inspired by you and by your campaign and message that you brought, and that inspiration is dying away. It feels like the American Dream is not attainable to a lot of us. And what I'm really hoping to hear from you is several concrete steps that you\u2019re going to take moving forward that will be able to re-ignite my generation, re-ignite the youth who are beset by student loans. And I really want to know, is the American Dream dead for me?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, we still have the best universities in the world. We\u2019ve got the most dynamic private sector in the world. We\u2019ve got the most productive workers in the world. There is not a country in the world that would not want to change places with us. For all the problems that we\u2019ve got, as tough as things are right now, we are still the country that billions of people around the world look to and aspire to. And I want everybody to always remember that.\n\nNow, as I said before, what we saw happening during 2001 to the time I took office was wages actually declining for middle-class families, people treading water, young people having more trouble getting their foot in the door in terms of businesses. And so we are now having to go back to the fundamentals that made America great.\n\nAnd that means we\u2019ve got to improve our education system. That means that we have to make sure that our markets are working in a way that is good for a broad base of people and not just a narrow base of people. It means that, let\u2019s say -- you used the example of student loans -- one of the things that I just mentioned was, is that we put billions of dollars more into student loans. This was paid for, now. We took this out of financial service industries that were getting essentially unjustified subsidies -- they\u2019re now going to students so that your debt would be lower. And by the way, part of that law also capped your debt at 10 percent of your income so that you knew that you could actually afford to take out this debt and pay for it even if you had a modest salary.\n\n\n\nSo we are taking these steps. But the most important thing we can do right now is to grow our economy. That\u2019s the single most important thing that we can do. And some of the measures that we\u2019ve put forward and I\u2019m going to be fighting for are designed to exactly do that.\n\nFor example, we\u2019ve said let\u2019s accelerate business investment in the year 2011 to give a further jumpstart to the economy. That\u2019s something that, by the way, doesn\u2019t add to the deficit necessarily long term because this is depreciation that could be taken in the out-years. We\u2019re just saying you invest now, you can take it now. And that gives businesses incentives to do it.\n\nWe want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing in research and development here in the United States because the key to our long-term growth is technology and innovation. And if we can get more of those investments here, that's going to improve. The reforms we\u2019ve made on education -- which, by the way, have received bipartisan support -- are designed to make sure we\u2019ve got the best engineers and the best scientists in the world right here in the United States.\n\nSo if we\u2019re doing all those things, I am confident that the American Dream will continue for the next generation. What we can\u2019t do, though, is go back to the same old things that we were doing, because we\u2019ve been putting off these problems for decades. And that is something that I refuse to do.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me ask you a question about course correction. Sometimes a leader, even if you think you\u2019ve done the right things, but if the people you\u2019re trying to lead don't think so, you\u2019ve got to somehow accommodate that, just like you would in a relationship. He was talking about marriage. (Laughter.)\n\nAs you go forward, is there any way in which you want to signal to the American people that you\u2019re going to change your approach? And specifically -- we\u2019re coming up to the midterm election -- have you asked your Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and your top economic advisor Larry Summers to stay with you through the end of your term, or might you make some changes?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I have not made any determinations about personnel. I think Larry Summers and Tim Geithner have done an outstanding job, as have my whole economic team. This is tough, the work that they do. They\u2019ve been at it for two years, and they\u2019re going to have a whole range of decisions about family that will factor into this, as well. But the bottom line is, is that we\u2019re constantly thinking, is what we\u2019re doing working as well as it could? Do we have other options and other alternatives that we can explore?\n\nI think one of the things that's on a lot of people\u2019s minds right now, obviously, for example, is the issue of deficits and debt. That has fanned a lot of people\u2019s concerns because we had to take a lot of emergency decisions last year that cost money. Now, they were the right things to do. Had we not taken them, the economy would be in a much worse position. Even John McCain\u2019s former economist during the campaign has said that if we hadn\u2019t taken these steps, that we might have lost another 8 million jobs, and we would be in an even deeper hole.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: And we know you have that commission that reports in December, but I think a lot of Americans may wonder how serious you are about what that commission is going to do.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let me tell you. We\u2019ve already identified $250 billion in cuts on the discretionary side of our budget. We\u2019ve identified $300 billion worth of loopholes in our tax code that are not helping economic growth. If we just did those two things, as I\u2019ve already proposed, that would make a huge difference. We\u2019ve proposed to freeze discretionary spending for three years, to start whittling down some of the debt that I inherited.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Peter Orszag, as you know, your former budget director, says that we can\u2019t afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for anyone after a year or two. Is he right?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to make sure I get this gentleman\u2019s question in, but I will say this. The debate that we\u2019re having about tax cuts right now I think really speaks to the choices that everybody here is going to be facing as we go forward. I think all of us are concerned about the deficit; all of us are concerned about the debt. Now, what we\u2019ve said is that we should extend tax cuts, tax relief, for middle-class Americans -- like most of the audience here -- because, first of all, you\u2019re the ones who didn't see your wages or income rise. Second of all, you\u2019re the folks who are most likely to spend it on a new computer for your kids, or in some other fashion that would boost demand in the economy.\n\nEverybody agrees that this should be done. All we\u2019ve said is that you get those tax breaks up to $250,000 a year. After that, if you make more than $250,000 a year, you still get a tax break; it\u2019s just you only get it up to $250,000 --\n\nMR. HARWOOD: House Speak Pelosi said last week --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And let me say this, John, because I just think it\u2019s very important that everybody understands this. What the Republicans are proposing is that we, in addition to that, provide tax relief to primarily millionaires and billionaires. It would cost us $700 billion to do it. On average, millionaires would get a check of $100,000.\n\nAnd by the way, I would be helped by this, so I just want to be clear. I\u2019m speaking against my own financial interests. This is a -- it is a irresponsible thing for us to do. Those folks are the least likely to spend it and -- (applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Well, let me ask you from this angle. House Speaker Pelosi last week said you can get 80 percent of the revenue if you simply take away the tax cuts for people over a million dollars. Are you open to any sort of compromise that would capture most of that revenue, but those people between $250,000 and a million would get to keep that tax cut?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s the basic principle. Here\u2019s what I can\u2019t do as President. I think I\u2019ve worked pretty hard and I have a pretty big grasp of the challenges that we\u2019re facing. (Applause.) But here\u2019s what I can\u2019t do. I can\u2019t give tax cuts to the top 2 percent of Americans, 86 percent of that money going to people making a million dollars or more, and lower the deficit at the same time. I don\u2019t have the math.\n\nI would love to do it. Every -- anybody in elected office would love nothing more than to give everybody tax cuts, not cut services, make sure that I\u2019m providing help to student loans, make sure that we\u2019re keeping our roads safe and our bridges safe, and make sure that we\u2019re paying for our veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. At some point, the numbers just don\u2019t work.\n\nSo what I\u2019ve said is very simple. Let\u2019s go ahead and move forward on what we agree to, which is tax relief for 95 -- 97 percent of Americans. In fact, actually everybody would get tax relief, but just up to $250,000 a year more. And let\u2019s get the economy moving faster, let\u2019s get it growing faster. At some point in the future, if we want to have discussions about further lowering tax rates, let\u2019s do so at a time when we can actually afford it.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: All right, we\u2019ve kept this gentleman waiting long enough.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.\n\nQ Mr. President, it is an honor to be in front of you. I am a small business owner. I'm a third-generation business owner in Pennsylvania. We are actually celebrating our 100th-year anniversary because we were founded in 1910.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Congratulations. (Applause.) What\u2019s your business?\n\nQ Something called Susquehanna Glass, and we do monogrammed glasswork.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Outstanding.\n\nQ If you ever pick up a Williams-Sonoma catalog and buy a monogrammed glass, you\u2019re getting the stuff from me. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Congratulations -- and your grandfather started this?\n\nQ My grandfather and his brother started the business, yes, three generations.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s outstanding. That\u2019s great.\n\nQ Two world wars, one Great Depression, and a lot of economic recession, so we\u2019ve been through a lot. What I have learned in running a small business over that period of time is that to succeed, to survive, you have to reinvest in your business. It simply is imperative. The single greatest economic challenge that I face today is a public that is fearful and negative.\n\nYou, when you first came into office, your stimulus package actually funded a very ailing financial system, which was essential for small businesspeople. You turned around and invested in the auto industry, and I believe saved millions of jobs, and I think you\u2019re actually going to make a profit on them. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We are. That's true.\n\nQ And yet your critics continue to paint you as a dramatically anti-business President. I believe you are investing in this country, as small businesses invest. And yet for some reason the public just doesn\u2019t get it. I need you to help us understand how you can regain the political center, because you\u2019re losing the war of sound bites, you\u2019re losing the media cycles.\n\nI have a son that just graduated from college. He was just commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army. He wants to make a career of the Army. I want to have a business for him to come back to when he gets out of the Army.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let me say to your son thank you for your service to our country, and we want to make sure we\u2019ve got a strong economy for him to come back to. (Applause.)\n\nAs I said before, I think that if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last two years, it\u2019s very hard to find evidence of anything that we\u2019ve done that is designed to squash business as opposed to promote business.\n\nYou mentioned the auto industry. This is a great example of something that we did -- we knew it wasn\u2019t popular. I mean, people just -- the last thing folks wanted to see was us helping the auto industry. Now, keep in mind, the previous administration had been helping them, giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return. But we were at a point where two of the big three automakers were about to liquidate, in the midst of this huge recession, and we would have lost an additional million jobs as a consequence, but also lost what is a signature manufacturing industry in this country. I mean, we built the world auto industry.\n\nAnd so what we did was we said to the auto companies, we are going to help you, but you\u2019ve got to make some changes. You\u2019ve got to make sure that we see a restructuring of how you do business. And by the way, some of the folks who made the biggest concessions were actually the workers there. It wasn\u2019t -- they took huge cuts in terms of pay and benefits because they understood that there wage structures could no longer support the auto industry in a competitive era.\n\nWe are now seeing the top -- the three U.S. automakers making a profit for the first time in a long time. They are hiring for the first time in a long time. And that has huge ramifications, because there are suppliers, and the restaurant next to the plant that's open -- and so it has provided a lot of confidence in a lot of these communities. But it wasn\u2019t popular at the time.\n\nNow, there were some folks in -- on CNBC who were unhappy with our decision, partly because they had made bets, essentially, against the auto industry, or they had senior debt. And we said, you know what, if the workers are giving up something, if management is giving up something, if the federal government is giving up something, and taxpayers are giving something, you\u2019re not going to get a hundred percent of what you bargained for in terms of some of the investments that you made here. You\u2019re going to have to take a haircut, too. And they got very mad about it. I still remember some of the fulminating that was taking place on CNBC about it. (Laughter.)\n\nWe didn\u2019t do that because we were anti-business. We were doing it because we wanted to make sure that these businesses would continue. And by the way, some of the same folks who complained were some of the same folks who, if we hadn\u2019t taken some of those actions on Wall Street, would have lost everything they had. And they didn\u2019t mind us intervening when it was helping them. But they did mind it when we were helping some other folks.\n\nSo the point, I guess, I\u2019m making is this. I think that American businesses like yours are what make this country go. We have passed eight tax cuts for small businesses so far. We have made it easier for you to invest in plants and equipment. We have already taken down your capital gains and we want to reduce capital gains for small businesses down to zero. All of these things are what historically have been considered pro-business agendas.\n\nEven on health care, a lot of small businesses couldn\u2019t provide health care. We are now saying we\u2019ve giving you a tax break if you provide health care to your workers. And 4 million small businesses out there are in a position to potentially take advantage of it.\n\nBut what is absolutely true -- and this goes to the point you were making earlier, John, about midcourse corrections -- the rhetoric and the politicizing of so many decisions that are out there has to be toned down. We\u2019ve got to get back to working together. And my hope is -- and this is part of my job as leader. It\u2019s not just a matter of implementing good policies, but also setting a better tone so that everybody feels like we can start cooperating again, instead of going at loggerheads all the time. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to have to do more additional outreach to business community on that front.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: You mentioned fulminating. One of my colleagues, Rick Santelli, was one of those who complained about your policies early -- some of the government interventions, and here\u2019s a question that he submitted on the issue of spending.\n\n(Video is shown.)\n\nMR. SANTELLI: Mr. President, if I was to ask an investor would he invest in a company that for every dollar spent, it had to borrow 42 cents, I think that investor would think long and hard. Now, if you look at the amount of money the government takes in and what we are spending, those are pretty much the numbers for our government right now. Does it bother you that 42 cents of every dollar we are spending is borrowed? Even understanding that we have to deficit-spend during tough times, how long can the U.S. continue to spend in that fashion without potentially hurting our long-term financial health?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it bothers me a lot. It bothered me when I was running for office, and it bothered me when I arrived and I had a $1.3 trillion deficit wrapped in a bow, waiting for me at the Oval Office. (Laughter.) So the answer to Rick\u2019s question is we\u2019re going to have to do something about it. And we\u2019ve got to do it -- do something about it fairly rapidly.\n\nThe first thing you do when you\u2019re in a hole is not dig it deeper. That's why this tax debate is important. We can\u2019t give $700 billion away to some -- America\u2019s wealthiest people. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we are responsible stewards for our budget. That's point number one.\n\nAs I've said before, I\u2019ve already instituted a budgetary freeze for three years on non-security discretionary spending. That can make a difference. We\u2019ve identified over a half a trillion dollars in changes to the budget that could make a difference.\n\nThe one thing I do have to say, though, to the public is that about 60 percent of our budget is entitlements -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And a lot of the discretion that I have is somewhat limited on some of these programs.\n\nNow, part of the reason, for example, that health care reform was so important is because the biggest driver of our long-term deficits is Medicare. If health -- if our economy is growing at 2 or 3 or 4 percent but health care costs are going up 6 or 7 or 8 percent, then the budget will blow up no matter how many cuts I make in other programs.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: So everybody in this room needs to buckle up and be prepared for lower Social Security benefits and lower Medicare benefits in the future?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What we have to do is make sure that we take in -- the amount of money that we\u2019re taking in and the amount of money that we\u2019re going out matches up. And all of us have to have a conversation. If we think it\u2019s important, for example, to treat our veterans fairly after they\u2019ve served us -- (applause) -- and they come back with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder -- and obviously everybody here does -- well, that costs money.\n\nIf we think it\u2019s important for us to invest in research and development -- R&D spending in this country had flat-lined over the previous decade -- if we think that us being at the cutting edge in science and technology is the key to our economic future, well, we\u2019ve got to make those investments.\n\nOn infrastructure, I\u2019ve proposed, as I said, that we expand infrastructure. Europe spends 5 percent of their GDP, their gross domestic product, their total economic output, on infrastructure. China spends 9 percent on infrastructure. We\u2019re spending 2 percent -- which is why our bridges fall down, and our roads are messed up, and our sewer systems and our airports -- all these things are in a bad way.\n\nSo there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. We\u2019ve got to make long-term investments, and we\u2019ve got to do so at a time when the economy is in a tough situation. We\u2019ve got to identify those things that don\u2019t work, programs that aren\u2019t working the way they\u2019re supposed to, tax loopholes that aren\u2019t encouraging economic growth, and we\u2019ve got to eliminate those. And we\u2019ve got to do it -- and here\u2019s the biggest challenge -- we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t risk the current recovery.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got to think medium and long term, and look at these long-term projections and say to ourselves are there some changes we can make that may not take effect this year but will take effect five years from now or 10 years from now so that we\u2019ve got a better budget situation. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let\u2019s go to our audience.\n\nQ Good afternoon, Mr. President. Thank you for coming to speak with us today. I am a full-time MBA student at Georgetown University right here in the District. And my question is with regards to those individuals that feel like federal government is getting too large, specifically the Tea Party\u2019s movement. My dad and I were talking about the midterm elections just last night, and he was asking who we should vote for. And the question was what will the administration do if these activists are elected?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say this about the Tea Party movement -- which your friend, Rick, helped to name. I think that America has a noble tradition of being healthily skeptical about government. That's in our DNA, right? (Applause.) I mean, we came in because the folks over on the other side of the Atlantic had been oppressing folks without giving them representation. And so we\u2019ve always had a healthy skepticism about government. And I think that's a good thing.\n\nI think there\u2019s also a noble tradition in the Republican and Democratic parties of saying that government should pay its way, that it shouldn\u2019t get so big that we\u2019re leaving debt to the next generation. All those things, I think, are healthy.\n\nThe problem that I\u2019ve seen in the debate that's been taking place and in some of these Tea Party events is I think they\u2019re misidentifying sort of who the culprits are here. As I said before, we had to take some emergency steps last year. But the majority of economists will tell you that the emergency steps we take are not the problem long term. The problem long term are the problems that I talked about earlier. We\u2019ve got -- we had two tax cuts that weren\u2019t paid for, two wars that weren\u2019t paid for. We\u2019ve got a population that's getting older. We\u2019re all demanding services, but our taxes have actually substantially gone down.\n\nAnd so the challenge, I think, for the Tea Party movement is to identify specifically what would you do. It\u2019s not enough just to say, get control of spending. I think it\u2019s important for you to say, I\u2019m willing to cut veterans\u2019 benefits, or I\u2019m willing to cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, or I\u2019m willing to see these taxes go up.\n\nWhat you can\u2019t do -- which is what I\u2019ve been hearing a lot from the other side -- is say we\u2019re going to control government spending, we\u2019re going to propose $4 trillion of additional tax cuts, and that magically somehow things are going to work.\n\nNow, some of these are very difficult choices. We were talking earlier about the business community and how it feels. We haven\u2019t raised corporate tax rates since I\u2019ve been in office. People keep on saying that I might. But we haven\u2019t. We haven\u2019t proposed it --\n\nMR. HARWOOD: They want you to cut them.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And what I\u2019ve said is if you can lower corporate tax rates by eliminating loopholes so that it\u2019s tax-neutral, I'm happy to work with you.\n\nWe've said, for example, that we don't want -- right now dividends are taxed at 15 percent. They used to be taxed at 39 percent under the Clinton administration. And what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s take them up to 20. That would be a reasonable position that would still be pro-business but wouldn\u2019t be so draining on the Treasury.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got a bunch of these decisions that have to be made. I think we can all have a reasonable argument. And we\u2019re going to have some difference in terms of how to go about it. Some of us may want a few more cuts; some of us may want higher revenues. But understand that there are facts and a reality there that go beyond the political rhetoric, and we\u2019re not going to be able to solve this problem just by yelling at each other. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let me ask you about one more specific thing the Tea Party argues that you\u2019re very welcome to speak to. There are some in the Tea Party who argue that the Constitution has been perverted in a way that gives government license to get involved in any activity -- the Commerce clause. You\u2019re a former constitutional law professor.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: What\u2019s your analysis of that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the truth of the matter is that the federal government is probably less intrusive now than it was 30 years ago. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They're much lower than they were under Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nIt is true that there are some areas that we regulate more. But you know what, the truth is everybody here probably thinks it\u2019s a pretty good idea that we regulate the food industry, for example, so we don't get E. coli and salmonella. Well, that requires somebody overseeing businesses -- most of whom are trying to do a good job, but some of them may not have the safety provisions in place to do that.\n\nI think most people here think it is a good idea to make sure that you\u2019re not cheated if you are seeking a mortgage. Well, that requires some oversight. So we\u2019re always going to try to balance regulation with making sure that people can go about their business and go about their lives without a bunch of people meddling in it.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Having enacted a lot of stimulus and realizing the political appetite is drained, are you prepared now to say that in terms of getting the economy going, the era of big government is over and it\u2019s time to stand up the private sector, and that's the focus of your policy?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: My entire focus right now is to make sure that the private sector is thriving, is growing, is investing. As I said, that's why we haven\u2019t increased taxes on corporations. We are not proposing dividends to go up -- taxation on dividends to go up above 20 percent. I think we\u2019ve been very responsible stewards.\n\nI do believe that we\u2019ve got to make sure that basic rules of the road are in place and that consumers, workers, ordinary folks out there aren\u2019t taken advantage of by sharp business practices. And I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything about that that's inherently anti-business. Some of the business owners that we heard today, they are making a profit by offering a good service at a good price. And that's who we want to see rewarded. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let\u2019s go to Anthony Scaramucci, who is familiar to some viewers of our network because he appears on CNBC as a hedge fund manager.\n\nQ And I also went to law school with you with Brian Mathis back in the day.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s great to see you. You\u2019ve done very well. (Laughter and applause.) Congratulations. That\u2019s great.\n\nQ And if I fouled you on the hoop court, it wasn\u2019t intentional.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I remember that. (Laughter.)\n\nQ You would remember if I fouled you. I got a low center of gravity. (Laughter.) The question I have, sir, and this is something I really -- a lot of my friends are thinking about. Listen, I represent the Wall Street community. We have felt like a pi\u00f1ata. Maybe you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re whacking us with a stick, but we certainly feel like we\u2019ve been whacked with a stick. So I certainly think that Main Street and Wall Street are connected, and if we\u2019re going to heal the society and make the economy better, how are we going to work towards that, healing Wall Street and Main Street? Question number one.\n\nAnd then question number two has to do with job growth. I was doing a calculation -- I run SkyBridge Capital; it\u2019s got $7.4 billion under management -- and I\u2019m thinking about hiring new people. A $50,000 worker in New York City, if I want to pay the full freight on the health care plus the FICA and all the other stuff, it\u2019s about $90,000, sir. That woman, man or woman, is going to take home about $35,000. It seems very, very disconnected, and I think that\u2019s one of the main reasons why we don\u2019t have a lot of job growth.\n\nSo two questions: When are we going to stop whacking at the Wall Street pi\u00f1ata? And how are we going to fix that arbitrage so that we can create jobs in our society?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, on the first issue --\n\nQ And I promise not to foul you if we play hoops again. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: On the first question, I think it would be useful to go back and look at the speeches that I\u2019ve made, including a speech, by the way, I made back in 2007 on Wall Street before Lehmans had gone under, in which I warned about a potential crisis if we didn\u2019t start reforming practices on Wall Street.\n\nAt the time, I said exactly what you said, which is Wall Street and Main Street are connected. We need a vibrant, vital financial sector that is investing in businesses, investing in jobs, investing in our people, providing consumers loans so they can buy products -- all that is very important and we want that to thrive. But we\u2019ve got to do so in a responsible way.\n\nNow, I had been amused over the last couple years -- this sense of somehow me beating up on Wall Street -- I think most folks on Main Street feel like they got beat up on -- (applause) -- and I\u2019ll be honest with you, there\u2019s probably a big chunk of the country --\n\nQ But people connect us --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hold on a second -- there\u2019s a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street. (Applause.) That\u2019s probably the majority, not the minority.\n\nNow, what I\u2019ve tried to do is just try to be practical. I\u2019m sure that at any given point over the last two years, there have been times where I have been frustrated, and I\u2019ll give you some examples. I mean, when I hear folks who say that somehow we\u2019re being too tough on Wall Street, but after a huge crisis, the top 25 hedge fund managers took home a billion dollars in income that year -- $1 billion. That\u2019s the average for the top 25, which is --\n\nMR. HARWOOD: And yet Forbes Magazine puts on their cover a story saying, \u201che has an anti-colonial attitude\u201d -- or Steve Schwarzman, a big figure on Wall Street, says, \u201ctheir approach to the financial regulation and taxation is like Hitler invading Poland.\u201d Where does that come from?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know where that comes from. That\u2019s my point. I guess -- it is a two-way street. If you\u2019re making a billion a year, after a very bad financial crisis where 8 million people lost their jobs and small businesses can\u2019t get loans, then I think that you shouldn\u2019t be feeling put upon. The question should be how can we work with you to continue to grow the economy.\n\nA big source of frustration -- this quote that you just said, this was me acting like Hitler going into Poland, had to do with a proposal to change a rule called \u201ccarried interest,\u201d which basically allows hedge fund managers to get taxed at 15 percent on their income. Now, everybody else is getting taxed at a lot more. (Laughter.) The secretary of the hedge fund is probably being taxed at 25, 28 -- right? And these folks are making -- getting taxed at 15.\n\nNow, there are complicated economic arguments as to why this isn\u2019t really income, this is more like capital gains, and so forth, which is a fair argument to have. I have no problem having that argument with hedge fund managers, many of whom I know and went to school with. And I respect their business acumen. But the notion that somehow me saying maybe you should be taxed more like your secretary, when you\u2019re pulling home a billion dollars or a hundred million dollars a year, I don't think is me being extremist or being anti-business. (Applause.) And that's the confusion we get into.\n\nI do want to be fair about your other point, which is the cost of workers. One of the things -- one of the laws that we passed this year was the HIRE Act, which said we\u2019ll give you a tax break if you hire a new worker, to try to reduce some of those costs. And in some high-cost places like New York City, the costs for the average worker maybe be even higher than it is if you are in some other places.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Why not a payroll tax holiday for exactly the issue that he mentioned?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, this is something that we\u2019ve examined. And we are going to be working with businesses to see does it make sense for us to initiate some additional incentives in order to hire.\n\nThe one thing that I want to make clear about, though, is our health care bill didn\u2019t substantially add to employers\u2019 health care costs. It exempts from any kind of costs for employers folks who have 50 employees or less. What we\u2019ve said is if you\u2019ve got more than 50 employees, then you should be able to give them health care. And we will give you tax incentives. Basically, we\u2019ll pay for -- we\u2019ll give you a break that's as much of a third of your cost for their health care premiums. And the reason we\u2019re doing that is because if you\u2019re not paying for it, then taxpayers are paying for it. We\u2019re all paying for it because, on average, these emergency room visits for people who don't have health insurance add up to an extra thousand dollars on each of our premiums who do have health insurance.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Did I understand you just to say a moment ago that you are continuing to examine a payroll tax holiday, and may be open to that as a way of spurring hiring?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: John, I think -- here\u2019s what you can rest assured, is we are willing to look at any idea that's out there that we think will help. But we\u2019ve got to do so in a responsible way. We\u2019ve got to make sure that whatever it is that we\u2019re proposing gives us the best bang for the buck. A lot of ideas that look good on paper, when you start digging into them it turns out that they\u2019re more complicated and they may end up not working the way they\u2019re supposed to.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got to be self-critical. There are times where, for example, in the housing market, we were very successful in keeping the housing market alive at a time when it had completely shut down. But a lot of folks are still losing their homes because they\u2019ve lost their job; they\u2019re just having trouble making their mortgage payments. And what we\u2019ve been trying to do is to get the banks to work with the borrower to see can you adjust the mortgage so that if they\u2019re willing to make a payment, that they can stay in their homes. That --\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Hasn\u2019t experience proven, though, that those interventions haven\u2019t worked, and basically the housing market has got to find its bottom and then get back up?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, this was the argument that Rick Santelli made. This is when he went on that rant about the Tea Party. (Applause.) It is a fair economic argument that some people make that say, you know what, just leave it alone, and if people are losing their homes, they\u2019ve got to lose their homes, and if the housing market has to go down another 10 percent, just let it go down another 10 percent, and eventually it will find bottom. That's the argument that's being made out there.\n\nI guess my job as President is to think about those families that are losing their home not as some abstract numbers. I mean, these are real people who worked really hard for that house. And we think it\u2019s very important that speculators, people who are just trying to flip condos, et cetera, that they\u2019re not getting help. We think it\u2019s very important to acknowledge that some people just bought too much house; they couldn\u2019t afford it. And it\u2019s not fair for the rest of us to have to subsidize them because of bad judgments and mistakes that they made.\n\nOn the other hand, we also think it\u2019s important to recognize that if you\u2019ve got communities where you\u2019ve got -- every other house is foreclosed, that that's bad for the economy as a whole.\n\nSo these are all tough decisions. But the main point I want to make is, is that we are going to constantly reexamine what we\u2019re doing. We are open to new ideas that are out there, and if we think something is going to work to put people to work, then absolutely we\u2019re going to try to make it happen.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let me ask you about two national security issues that are relevant to economic performance. One is Iran. Markets watch very closely for evidence of stability or lack of stability in the Middle East.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Colin Powell said yesterday that even though we can\u2019t take any option off the table, the stars are not lining up for an attack on Iran by the United States, by Israel or the two countries in combination. Has he got that right?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, General Powell is a very smart man. And I don't want to have a discussion about all the plans that we have in place to deal with Iran.\n\nIran having a nuclear weapon would be a real problem. We passed the toughest sanctions against Iran ever. They are having an effect. We continue to be open to diplomatic solutions to resolve this. We don't think that a war between Israel and Iran, or military options would be the ideal way to solve this problem. But we are keeping all our options on the table.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: China. A very quick way to improve the competiveness of U.S. exports would be if the value of China\u2019s currency rises. Is it time for you to be tougher than you have been so far on pressing the Chinese?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is a real problem. And I want to just give everybody some background on this. China -- its currency is valued lower than market conditions would say it should be. And what that means is essentially that they can sell stuff cheaper here, and our stuff when we try to sell there is more expensive. So it gives them an advantage in trade.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve said to them is you need to let your currency rise in accordance to the fact that your economy is rising, you're getting wealthier, you\u2019re exporting a lot. There should be an adjustment there based on market conditions. They have said yes in theory, but in fact they have not done everything that needs to be done. We are going to continue to insist that on this issue and on all trade issues between us and China, that it\u2019s a two-way street.\n\nLook, it\u2019s good for us that China does well, in the sense that, first of all, having millions of people get out of poverty is a good thing for the world. It makes them more stable. It buys them into a world economy that can reduce tensions and allow our businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a huge market where we should be able to export a lot of goods. Eventually, I want some of those nice monogrammed glass things to be in Shanghai and Beijing. (Laughter.) But it\u2019s got to be fair. Our trade relationship has to be fair. You can\u2019t just sell to us and we can\u2019t sell to you.\n\nAnd so we have been bringing more actions against China before the World Trade Organization. We are going to enforce our trade laws much more effectively than we have in the past -- not because I\u2019m anti-trade. I\u2019m pro-trade. I just want to make sure that trade is good for American businesses and American workers. And over the last several years, it hasn\u2019t always been. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, final question, because we\u2019re out of time and you\u2019ve got to go.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m having so much fun, though. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Fifteen years ago, at a similar point in his presidency, Bill Clinton took the stage at a town hall in New Hampshire with Newt Gingrich, who was then Speaker of the House. Are you willing to and would you like to debate John Boehner, the House Republican leader, before the election to lay out your two visions for the economy?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that it\u2019s premature to say that John Boehner is going to be Speaker of the House. (Applause.) I do think it is very important for the country, as we go into these midterm elections, to understand that there\u2019s a choice in front of us. The other side, their basic argument is that if we go back to doing what we were doing before the financial crisis and before I was President, that we\u2019d be in a better place.\n\nNow, think about this. From 2001 to the time I took office, your average wages went down 5 percent. We took a record surplus under Bill Clinton and took it to record deficits. We had two tax cuts that weren\u2019t paid for, two wars that weren\u2019t paid for, that were hugely expensive. We put off solving health care costs that were skyrocketing. We didn\u2019t solve college tuition costs that were skyrocketing. We didn\u2019t have an energy policy. We were seeing jobs being shipped overseas because of the way our tax structure gave them incentives. Now, that was the agenda. We have tried what they\u2019re offering.\n\nNow, I stay up every night and I wake up every morning thinking about the people who sent me into this job. And the single-most important task I have is to make sure that the dreams of you and your families are realized. And so everything I\u2019m doing is thinking about how do we grow this economy and how we grow this middle class. It has not happened fast enough. I know how frustrated people are. I know in some cases how desperate people are.\n\nBut I also know this -- that an economy that was shrinking is now growing. We have finally tackled tough challenges like health care that we had been putting off for decades. I have put forward proposals that are going to require bipartisan cooperation in order for us to get government spending under control.\n\nAnd I am confident that if we stay on a course that gets us back to old-fashioned values of hard work and responsibility and looking out for one another, that America will thrive; that the 21st century will be an American Century again. (Applause.) But I\u2019m going to need everybody\u2019s support. I\u2019m happy to have that debate over the course of the next several weeks and for months to come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nEND\n\n1:05 P.M. EDT",

    "text":"We can all agree that if we want to bring down skyrocketing costs, we'll need to modernize our system and invest in prevention. We can agree that if we want greater accountability and responsibility, we have to ensure that people aren't overcharged for prescription drugs, or discriminated against for pre-existing conditions -- and we need to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in government programs. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive.\n\nAnd finally, we can all agree that if we want to translate these goals into policies, we need a process that is as transparent and inclusive as possible. And that's why I've asked all of you -- representatives of organizations, interests, and parties from across the spectrum -- to join us here today. In fact, this was the hottest ticket in town. (Laughter.) That's why we asked concerned citizens like the folks on this stage to organize open meetings across America where people could air their views. As Travis said, more than 3,000 meetings were held in all 50 states and D.C.; more than 30,000 people attended. I thank them for their input and their ideas, and look forward to reading the report that Travis has presented to me.\n\nIn this effort, every voice has to be heard. Every idea must be considered. Every option must be on the table. There should be no sacred cows. Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything that we want, and that no proposal for reform will be perfect. If that's the measure, we will never get anything done. But when it comes to addressing our health care challenge, we can no longer let the perfect be the enemy of the essential. And I don't think anybody would argue that we are on a sustainable path when it comes to health care.\n\nFinally, I want to be very clear at the outset that while everyone has a right to take part in this discussion, nobody has the right to take it over and dominate. The status quo is the one option that's not on the table, and those who seek to block any reform at all -- any reform at any costs will not prevail this time around.\n\nI didn't come here to Washington to work for those interests. I came here to work for the American people -- the folks I met on the campaign trail, the people I hear from every single day in the White House. Folks who are working hard, making all the right decisions, but still face choices that no one in this country should have to make: how long to put off that doctor's appointment; whether to fill that prescription; when to give up and head to the emergency room because there are no other options.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nBRET BAIER, HOST: I\u2019m Bret Baier, in for Chris Wallace.\n\nWorld powers race against the clock for an Iran nuclear deal.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: If the tough decisions don't get made, we are absolutely prepared to call an end to this process.\n\nBAIER: Now, a new deadline as the U.S. and Iran attempt to set aside their differences. But will Congress try to sink a bad deal?\n\nWe'll discuss with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. It's a \"Fox News Sunday\" exclusive.\n\nPlus, Hillary Clinton faces attacks from presidential candidates on the left and the right.\n\nGOV. BOBBY JINDAL, R-LA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Give Bernie Sanders credit. At least he's honest. At least he calls himself a socialist.\n\nBAIER: We sit down with two candidates making a run for the White House. Republican Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, the latest contender in the Democratic race.\n\nThen, despite stirring up controversy, Donald Trump rises in the polls and leaves open the third-party door.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Many people have asked me to go independent. I think I\u2019d do very well if I went independent.\n\nBAIER: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether he could be a spoiler for the GOP.\n\nAll, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBAIER: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. and other world powers are working with a new goal of Monday to reach an agreement in the Iran nuclear negotiations. It's the fourth extension in the marathon talks and now we have word from Vienna a deal could be within reach.\n\nFox News correspondent Kevin Corke has the latest -- Kevin.\n\nKEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, the U.S., Iran and those five world powers have given themselves until Monday to reach that deal but there's reporting as you point out to suggest overnight that a deal could be imminent and announced perhaps as soon as tomorrow.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry and his team have gone to great lengths to reach a deal despite Iran\u2019s repeated violations of U.N. sanctions and general destabilizing behavior in the Middle East. Now, this final push comes amid accusations from Tehran that the West is trying to change the terms of the deal at the 11th hour.\n\nAnd, yes, there are still several major sticking points. Among them, Iran would like immediate relief from the U.N. arms embargo that dates back to 2006. It\u2019d also like to limit access to their military sites during possible inspections and perhaps most importantly, they would like to speed up sanctions relief because of the beleaguered economy there.\n\nNow, despite all of the road blocks, Secretary Kerry remains optimistic.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKERRY: Very good meeting, very positive. I think we're getting to some real decisions. So, I would say, even as we have a few tough things to do, I remain hopeful, hopeful.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCORKE: Now, as you know, Bret, of course, the goal of the deal is to increase the time it would take for Iran to produce enough enriched uranium fuel for a single weapon up from estimate of two to three months to about a year. And if there is a deal, that would limit Iran's enrichment program for expect at least about a decade and that certainly would be a major development -- Bret.\n\nBAIER: Kevin, thank you.\n\nWell, any deal the negotiators strike must go before Congress, which now has 60 days to review it. So what are its prospects on Capitol Hill?\n\nJoining me here in D.C.: Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, who has warned against accepting a weak deal.\n\nSenator, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., MAJORITY LEADER: Glad to be with you.\n\nBAIER: Let\u2019s star here -- what does an acceptable Iran deal look like?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, look, we already know that it's going to leave Iran as a threshold nuclear state. We know that. It appears as if the administration's approach to this was to reach whatever agreement the Iranians are willing to enter into.\n\nSo I think it's going to be a very hard sell if it's completed in Congress. There was another option here I would like to remind people -- rather than spending multiple years trying to get one of the worst regimes in the world to agree to limit their nuclear capabilities, we could ratchet up sanctions even farther because that's what brought them to the table in the first place.\n\nBut the administration chose to do down this path and we're going to be interested in things like will Iranians reveal their past research and development, what have they done on the past on this subject? Is it verifiable? Will we be able to look at all of their military bases?\n\nAnd, by the way, even if you're satisfied on all of that, Bret, there's all of the other collateral activities and what they're up to in Syria and Lebanon and Gaza and Yemen --\n\nBAIER: Which is not a part of this.\n\nMCCONNELL: Which is not a part of it. And apparently, the ballistic missile capability, the ability to launch such a weapon to a target is not addressed as well. So, this is going to be a very hard sell for the administration. They'll have to get at least 34 votes, assuming a resolution of disapproval passes. The president vetoes it. He'll have to get at least 34 senators to go forward.\n\nBAIER: But you know where the head count is, just looking at what you look at in the Senate. I mean, you say it will be tough. But where will the red line be, for example, for Democrats who have said and expressed concern for -- about this potential deal?\n\nMCCONNELL: I think they're going to have the same concerns I just outlined. And I know there will be a strong pull not to go against the president on something as important as this is to him. But I hope there will be enough Democrats willing to look at this objectively and look at the facts. Is this a good deal? Is this likely to achieve the outcome we had hoped for?\n\nIf they can bring themselves to do that and make an objective evaluation of it, I think it's going to be a very hard sell for the administration.\n\nBAIER: According to a few press reports, the White House had a meeting Monday, a conference call with liberal groups, progressive groups saying -- getting ready for this push, saying it will be the president's number one foreign policy achievement. But at the end, it said, \"The White House remains confident that if Congress rejects the deal, the president could veto that action and continue to move forward.\"\n\nMCCONNELL: That's what I was talking about. It would require 34 votes for him to go forward.\n\nBAIER: Right. So, can you see them getting that?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, I think it's going to be a hard sell. He knows that the resolution of disapproval is likely to be introduced, is very likely to pass and very likely to get over 60 votes.\n\nIf he vetoes that, in order to sustain the veto, he would need 34 votes -- which is what I was referring to earlier.\n\nBAIER: Right, right.\n\nMCCONNELL: And I think it's going to be a hard sell. Hard sell.\n\nBAIER: If it all gets shot down, then what? What's next?\n\nMCCONNELL: Ratchet up sanctions. That's what brought them to the table in the first place. That's why they were hurting. That's a strategy that I think could have been deployed a couple years ago that could have got us to a better place.\n\nBAIER: There are other foreign policy achievements according to the Obama administration. They\u2019re talking about them. One of them is Cuba.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We don't have to be imprisoned by the past. When something isn't working, we can and will change. Americans and Cubans alike are ready to move forward.\n\nI believe it's time for Congress to do the same. I\u2019ve called on Congress to take steps to lift the embargo that prevents Americans from traveling or doing business in Cuba.\n\nNobody expects Cuba to be transformed overnight. I believe that American engagement through our embassy, our businesses, and most of all, through our people, is the best way to advance our interests.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: So, Senator, will Congress, will the Senate confirm a U.S. ambassador to Cuba? Will Congress lift the embargo?\n\nMCCONNELL: Let me quote somebody I rarely quote. Former President Jimmy Carter, who said he\u2019d be hard pressed to think of any place in the world where we were in better shape now than we were when President Obama came to office. President Carter got it right.\n\nWhat the president -- this president has been involved in is talking to a lot of countries -- talk, talk, talk. And Cuba is a good example. He thinks that simply by engaging with them we get a positive result.\n\nI don't see any indication that Cubans are going to change their behavior. What are we getting as a result of normalization of relations? I think it -- I think we\u2019ll not confirm an ambassador. They make -- believe they don't need that.\n\nThere are sanctions that were imposed by Congress I think the administration will have a hard time getting those removed. This is a policy that there is substantial opposition to in Congress.\n\nBAIER: You know conservatives are frustrated that they feel that Congress -- even though controlling both chambers -- is not pushing back against the Obama administration. It\u2019s had some successes with Obamacare, his -- what he calls his legislative achievement, surviving two Supreme Court challenges.\n\nYou helped him get the trade agenda across the finish line. Most believe eventually he's going to get Iran and Cuba through, too, if you ask him.\n\nIs that fair?\n\nMCCONNELL: I wouldn't count on that. I mean, he can win on Iran on this deal with holding 34 Democrats, because that's the way the approval process is structured.\n\nBut on trade, this is a long standing conservative position. We\u2019re a trading country, free trading country. And Trade Promotion Authority that we work with the president on is not just for him, it\u2019s for the next president, too. It's a six-year deal. We want the next Republican president to have an opportunity to enter into trade agreements and have them have them considered by Congress.\n\nBAIER: Are there other things on the agenda that you think you can get bipartisan consensus with before the election?\n\nMCCONNELL: Yes, I think so. I think we\u2019re going to be able to do something on cybersecurity. We\u2019re going to do -- this coming week, we're going to pass a rewrite of No Child Left Behind, which conservatives have wanted for a long time and some Democrats as well. Yes, we're going to be able to accomplish some things.\n\nBut all of us need to remember -- the president, whoever that is, can veto a measure. He has -- it's a very powerful position. And, therefore, we will not be able to do everything conservatives would like to do.\n\nBAIER: Senator, you mentioned cybersecurity. Hackers broke into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, stealing background investigation forms, fingerprint records, Social Security numbers for more than 22 million people.\n\nThe Washington Post put it in perspective. One in 15 Americans, if all the people called up in OPM hack live together, they would be the third largest state after California and Texas. More people were affected by the hack than are unemployed in American. Six million more Americans got hit by the OPM hack that have signed up for ObamaCare. Fewer people are projected to attend college and graduate school in the U.S. this year than were affected by this hack.\n\nFriday, the director of the office, Katherine Archuleta, resigned after saying she was going to stay on to fix the problem. So, what is your assessment of this problem and how now can the Obama administration protect the data and provide some security for the 22 million people affected?\n\nMCCONNELL: I\u2019m not sure they can. I mean, it's total incompetence -- complete and total incompetence. And resignation of the head of OPM is just the beginning.\n\nThis is a total mess. It's no wonder they had a hard time with the Web site which they launched Obamacare. These cybersecurity issues are enormously significant. What we're going to do is before August, take a step in the direction of dealing with the problem with information sharing bill that I think will be broadly supported. This is an administrative disaster that the president needs to get a hold of and get straightened out soon.\n\nBAIER: A couple more things. In the wake of all the attention of sanctuary cities, after this murder of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco, authorities say, at the hands of an illegal immigrant, five-time deportee -- will Congress move on sanctuary city legislation?\n\nMCCONNELL: We should. I think any sanctuary city -- for your viewers, that means that these are places where they choose to ignore the law -- should not be receiving federal criminal assistance money, period.\n\nBAIER: What do you make of -- what do you make of Donald Trump's success in the polls?\n\nMCCONNELL: Look, I\u2019m not going to get into all of the presidential candidates. We've got a bunch of \u2018em. At the end of the day, I think we're going to have a candidate who can win.\n\nBAIER: Here's a senator -- also who happens to be a candidate -- focus of criticism you are in his new book, \"A Time for Truth.\" Texas Senator Ted Cruz, he accuses you and Senate leadership, of trying to dry up his fundraising, planned hit pieces in the press, end up hurting him. He says you said one thing publicly, another privately about the debt ceiling. He accuses you of capitulating to Democrats, to avoid bad headlines, says that, essentially, you\u2019ve been lying. Not a great portrayal.\n\nMCCONNELL: Look, I\u2019m not going to take the bait and get into a discussion about the presidential campaign. We've got four senators running for president. A whole lot of other people as well. I think they can all do that without my assistance.\n\nBAIER: So, can a candidate who calls you and other Republicans part of the Washington cartel win the nomination?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, look, it's a free country. These candidates can say anything they want to.\n\nBAIER: Senator, thanks for your time.\n\nMCCONNELL: Thank you.\n\nBAIER: This week, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb became the fifth candidate vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, putting an emphasis on his foreign policy chops. So, what kind of challenge does he pose for frontrunner Hillary Clinton? He joins us next, live.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK,)\n\nBAIER: Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who served as Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan. He ran for Senate and won as a Democrat in Virginia, vehemently opposed the Iraq war. Now, he's running for the Democratic presidential nomination, facing an uphill battle against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is leading the field by double digits.\n\nSenator Webb joins me now.\n\nSenator, welcome to \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nFORMER SEN. JIM WEBB, D-VA., 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, thank you. Good to be with you.\n\nBAIER: Let's start with Iran as it looks like this deal is coming to a head. You said this week about the Iran deal that the administration is trying to get, quote, \"The end result of this could be acquiescent in allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nSo, it sounds like you would walk away from the table. Is that fair?\n\nWEBB: I would be hesitant with what I see right now. I agree a lot with what Senator McConnell just said, that what we do not want to do at this point is to send a signal to the region that we are accepting the notion that eventually Iran would be acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nThere are other ways that we can improve relations with Iran, confidence building gestures as we did with the Soviet Union over many years. Just that you don't have to have this deal in order to move forward with them. But -- you know, they seem pretty optimistic this morning from Europe. So, we'll see what they bring to the table.\n\nBAIER: As we said, you're highly decorated Vietnam veteran, former secretary of the navy, former senator who was intimately involved in military and foreign affairs while in office. This week, the Obama administration announced they're cutting the Army back 40,000. That\u2019s outside of the sequestered cuts.\n\nYour reaction to that?\n\nWEBB: Well, we go through these cycles whenever we have extended ground commitments. We've done it three or four times in my adult life.\n\nSo, I have great deal of confidence particularly in Joe Dunford, who\u2019s now going to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I\u2019ve known him for many, many years. I don't think that military leadership would be backing anything that they don't believe can work. The ground forces tend to constrict on wherever we get away from these long-term engagements. So, we\u2019ll have to see.\n\nBAIER: So, you support it?\n\nWEBB: No, I like -- I agree with the notion that ground forces are reduced when our extended ground commitments go down. But I don't know the numbers. I\u2019d have to take a look and see where they are.\n\nBAIER: The president defended this past week, his efforts, the administration efforts to degrade and destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBut the defense secretary, Ash Carter, was up on the Hill talking about the training of Syrian fighters to go after ISIS in Syria. And here's what he said:\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nASH CARTER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: As of July 3rd, we're currently training about 60 fighters. This number is much smaller than we\u2019d hoped for at this point.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: The administration allotted $500 million. They were hoping to get 5,400 Syrians. This is 60. Is that acceptable?\n\nWEBB: The long-term solution to the ISIS problem is going to have to come from the Sunni leadership in the region. In the interim period, we need to define specifically what our national security interests are and how we can bring that about.\n\nI don't think you're -- I think you\u2019re going to get there with us training these opposition forces in that way. It didn't work very well a few years ago before is showed up. But in terms of our national security interests, I think you're seeing some impact.\n\nBAIER: You mentioned General Dunford. He was up on Capitol Hill, was asked what is the biggest threat facing the U.S. He quickly answered Russia.\n\nDo you agree with him?\n\nWEBB: I would probably say China long-term strategic threat, if you look at the expansion that they have conducted over the last 15 years. I\u2019ve been talking about it in the South China Sea and building blue water navy.\n\nI take General Dunford's point about the turbulence with respect to Russia, but I think our friends and allies in Europe have done a pretty good job of helping us address that.\n\nBAIER: As president, would you send weapons to the Ukrainians, for example?\n\nWEBB: I would be open into looking at that. And I think that's where General Dunford was in his confirmation hearing. May I say something about this situation with Mr. Trump?\n\nBAIER: Of course.\n\nWEBB: I think the best comment that I\u2019ve read in terms of why this is so inflammatory with Mexican-American community comes from an individual who served with me in Vietnam during some very tough combat, Oscar Munoz, who\u2019s a Mexican-American, very fine soldier as are so many of them. He wrote a letter to Mr. Trump and he allowed me to post it on my Facebook page.\n\nAnd I hope anyone who cares about this issue will take a look at what he said. He basically said, \"Dear Mr. Trump, my father came from Mexico as a worker and not as a rapist. And by the way, I served my country in the United States Marine Corps. Where were you?\"\n\nSo, you know, this kind of divisive, inflammatory rhetoric by people who want to be commander in chief is not helpful and we have saw -- we\u2019ve seen from the liberal side as well, we\u2019ve seen this kind of rhetoric as it goes to Southern white cultures. We need to be inclusive, recognize that we have problems, that we can come together to solve them.\n\nBut don't be throwing these bombs to our cultural groups.\n\nBAIER: Well, to your point, Senator, you know, you mentioned the Democratic race. In Real Clear Politics average of polls, you are 2.3 percent. And well behind the front runner Hillary Clinton. You have an uphill climb against this Clinton machine.\n\nMost political analysts will tell you that Democrats have moved resolutely to the left and that basically Hillary Clinton has renounced Clintonism which was the vital core of the senator used to be in your party. In a party that seems to thrill to Bernie Sanders and maybe long for Elizabeth Warren, who are the Jim Webb Democrats?\n\nWEBB: I believe we can -- we can bring a different tone to the Democratic Party. You're right. The party has moved way far to the left. And that's not my Democratic Party but -- in and of itself. We need to bring working people back into the formula.\n\nNext Saturday, in the far southwest of Virginia, there's going to be a medical clinic, a remote area medical clinic to take care of people who don't have medical insurance. It\u2019s out at the wise county fairgrounds. I hope FOX will go down there and take a look at it. They're going to take care of about 6,000, at least, if historical records hold, people with no medical care. They'll pull 3,000 teeth. And these are people forgotten by both parties. And I think they need a voice.\n\nBAIER: Regarding the Confederacy and the battles we\u2019ve seen go well beyond South Carolina after they took down the Confederate battle flag. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants to ban certain state flags from the House side of the Capitol. Democrats would like to ban Confederate symbols from federal cemeteries. The Memphis City Council has voted to disinter Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nSo, the question is -- is this racial healing or part of political grandstanding?\n\nWEBB: Unfortunately, I think you're seeing it from both sides, which is why I mentioned the situation with Donald Trump with respect to Mexican-Americans. We're seeing an issue which should have been resolved and now is resolved, flying the Confederate battle flag in public places turning -- morphing into something much different.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, the best phone conversation I had during this whole last couple weeks was to a very close friend of mine, Nelson Jones. He\u2019s an African-American, fellow marine, fellow Naval Academy graduate, Georgetown law. He was my counsel when I was in Senate.\n\nAnd I said, Nelson, we have been talking about this for 40 years, that American South has never been black versus white. It's always been a veneer, inside and outside, manipulating the emotions of black versus white. What are you hearing down in Houston on this issue?\n\nHe said, I was just at the barber shop. I asked brothers what they thought about this and they said, \"Here we go again. When we\u2019re going to talk about jobs? When we\u2019re going to talk about education? When we\u2019re going to talk about harmony and bringing people together?\" And that's what inclusive leadership needs to be.\n\nBAIER: Senator Webb, thanks for your time.\n\nWEBB: Thank you.\n\nBAIER: Up next, the general slated to be President Obama's top military adviser, as we just mentioned, calls Russia the greatest threat to our national security. Our Sunday group joins the conversation and discusses whether Mitt Romney was right all along.\n\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about Russia, about negotiations with Iran, anything else. Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday. We may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBAIER: It's down to the wire in Europe's effort to save Greece from collapse. E.U. leaders are emergency -- are meeting in an emergency summit to discuss the latest aid proposal that could be Greece's final financial lifeline. If there is a deal, Athens could be bankrupt by the time world financial markets open Monday.\n\nFOX senior foreign affairs correspondent Amy Kellogg is live in Athens -- Amy.\n\nAMY KELLOGG, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Bret.\n\nWell, on Friday, it really did look like Greece and its creditors were very close to a deal, but, Bret, it turns out that is not the case at all.\n\nHowever, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has just been quoted out saying that he is willing to compromise.\n\nNow, where in the past of these negotiations, the hurdles have been technical. This time, they are being held up on the issue of trust and concern that the Greek government simply won't do what it has promised.\n\nNow, trust and particularly from German side has eroded since the Greek prime minister called a referendum last Sunday here. Voters said no to a package of austerity measures but less than a week later, their government turned around to creditors and said, OK, yes, to pretty much the same sort of package. And that is another reason why credibility is becoming more of an issue in these last-minute talks.\n\nIt being Sunday here, Greeks have taken to the beach in large numbers. Many of them say because the sea and the sun are the only things that haven't been taken from them and that are free. They've seen their economy shrink by a quarter in recent years, and with that, cuts in pensions, loss of jobs, and an ever-fraying social net.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nKELLOGG: Bret, Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels later on today. Eurozone leaders will meet and it had been hoped that a deal would be clinched by the end of today. But it's actually looking increasingly likely, many say, that the creditors will want to see the Greek parliament actually enact some legislation on reforms before further debt relief is agreed. Bret.\n\nBAIER: Amy Kellogg in Athens. Amy, thank you. Time now for our Sunday group. Fox News senior political analyst, Brit Hume. Julie Pace, who covers the White House for the Associated Press. GOP strategist Karl Rove. And Fox News political analyst, Juan Williams. OK. Brit, Greece.\n\nBRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it looks kind of bad either way. Because the new austerity measures are put in place by the Greeks. That is likely in the near term for sure and possibly for the long, to further suppress growth. What that country needs is some economic growth. And the economy is flat on its back. And while the pension payments and other government spending has a lot to do with that, and the debt is enormous, there's no way out I think for Greece to climb out of this without some kind of economic growth, and austerity measures in the near term will likely retard that.\n\nBAIER: And Julie, the trust level with creditors is pretty low.\n\nJULIE PACE, AP: I think that's what's so interesting about this situation this weekend. Is that it's not a matter of what a package would look like. Everyone can basically agree on what Greece needs. It's just a matter of will Greece be able to carry out a package of bailouts? Because we've been at this table before. Greece has had previous bailouts and we're still in this same situation.\n\nBAIER: I want to turn, Karl, to another deal that's pending. The Iran nuclear deal. You heard Senator McConnell say it's going to be a tough sell for Congress, even if they get across the finish line in Vienna. Your thoughts?\n\nKARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: I think it will be a tough deal. Because if you take a look at the administration's red lines early on -- we're going to have any time, anywhere inspections, and now we're talking about managed access. They were going to do away with the ability to enrich uranium. They still retain the ability to enrich uranium. We were going to do away with their infrastructure. They keep the infrastructure. We were talking about snapbacks on the sanctions, which is very hard to understand how we're going to snap back sanctions that were passed in years past when we had the support of Russia and China, when we will not have the automatic support of Russia and China at the United Nations to, quote, snap these back.\n\nAnd this is being also done -- this latest episode with the Iranians trying to tie this into not only the sanctions that are placed on them for their nuclear program, but also the sanctions that were placed on them for developing a ballistic missile program and for illicit traffic in arms. They want in essence a license to proliferate and a license to further engage in destabilizing the Middle East.\n\nSo -- if I were a Democrat, I would be really worried about having to vote on this. Because a bad deal could be worse than no deal at all, because a bad deal might explode next year in the middle of the presidential campaign.\n\nBAIER: So, Juan, if they get this deal, as is being forecast now, can the administration hold the line with Democrats? As Senator McConnell says they need 34, because that's -- if the president vetoes this disapproval.\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: That's the super majority. And so the key here is very interesting. Interesting political game going on. It extends into presidential politics. And the politics is, get Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state, to come out against the Iran deal, because if she comes out against the deal -- and Republicans would be quick to say if any deal comes forward that Hillary Clinton is responsible and a co-indicted conspirator with President Obama in terms of making this deal happen -- that they would be arming the most dangerous country.\n\nSo what you heard this morning from Senator McConnell, what you just heard from Karl, is Republicans saying the pressure is on the Democrats. We're going to hold Democrats accountable. And the question is whether the Democrats in the Senate will remain loyal to President Obama on this issue. Right now, the argument is the status quo is unacceptable, and that the only alternative, as you heard this morning, is additional sanctions. But don't forget. This is not a one-sided deal. You have the Iranians who say they would accelerate their nuclear program if a deal doesn't come about.\n\nBAIER: Overwhelming response on Facebook, Julie. Jennifer Long Moulton writes about the Iranians. \"They have lied to us in the past. Why even considering trusting them now?\" Is this a problem for Democrats if they get this deal and have to rally those senators?\n\nPACE: I think it potentially could be. I think Juan makes a good point here. The most important Democratic reaction to look for is not really what's going to be coming out of the White House, but it's going to be what's coming from the Clinton campaign, because she's going to be most likely the future leader of this party going into the election next year. She's so closely tied to this deal. She was secretary of state. She dispatched two of her closest advisers to lead the secret talks that led to these barter negotiations. She can't remove -- she can't put a real distance between her involvement in this, but she can come out and say that the final deal has too many holes in it, that it leaves Iran with too many options. If she does say that, I think it will be very difficult for President Obama to get Democratic support on the Hill.\n\nBAIER: Brit.\n\nHUME: All I can say is when I heard a deal might be close, was uh-oh. The deficiencies that Karl described, which is by comparing what we know roughly about the shape of the deal against the original goals of the negotiation, are damaging enough. But who knows what they had to do, what additional concessions may have been made in order to get this final deal? My guess is the chances of it being a good deal are extremely remote, and it would be I think politically tempting for Hillary Clinton, as she waffled on trade, remember, because it was toxic in her base. Will she do the same on this? She may. If she does, I think the analysis here is right. It could sink the deal in Congress.\n\nBAIER: We mentioned the general the president has tapped to be the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and his assessment of the biggest threat. Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-W.VA.: What would you consider the greatest threat to our national security?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My assessment today, Senator, is that Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security.\n\nMITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.\n\nOBAMA: The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because you know, the Cold War has been over for 20 years.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: You know, Juan, Mitt Romney said Russia was the No. 1 geopolitical foe, now the general coming in to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, (inaudible) by President Obama, is saying basically the same thing.\n\nWILLIAMS: He is. But I think the administration has responded -- Senator -- what you hear from Secretary of State Kerry and from President Obama is they don't agree with the general. Now, what you're hearing from the general --\n\nBAIER: Which is a problem.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, I don't know if it's a big problem. The problem is this -- should you send arms to the people who -- the resistance in the Ukraine. That's the argument. And you hear from military people a suggestion that it's time to take on Putin, to make it very clear. But when you look at it from a geopolitical, more strategic, diplomatic point of view, the State Department's perspective, they are locked into trying to change things in the Middle East. And I think if you look at terrorists, people around this table are certainly concerned about ISIS. I don't think you get a big argument.\n\nROVE: Juan, I wouldn't call it the resistance in Ukraine. I would call it the democratically elected government of Ukraine, which is an ally of the United States, that has its territory systematically invaded by Russia. And that's a threat to our relationship with Europe and to Europe's solidarity with the United States and the international order.\n\nNow, we can argue as to whether Russia or, as Senator Webb suggested, long-term China or ISIS and the instability in the Middle East is the most serious strategic threat, but the administration, if they are downplaying Russia, they are downplaying an actual threat.\n\nI have been in Europe recently talking with European leaders. There's a fear of what's going on in Ukraine and elsewhere in the region, prompted by Russia.\n\nBAIER: We'll leave it there. Up next, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal says Greece is an example of where the U.S. could go under a President Hillary Clinton or President Bernie Sanders. The Republican presidential candidate joins us live from the campaign trail, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBAIER: A look outside the Beltway at Cleveland, Ohio, site of the first Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox News a little more than three weeks from now.\n\nOne of the candidates vying to be on that stage, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who would first have to overcome a big deficit in the polls. Governor Jindal joins us from Iowa. Governor, thank you for being here.\n\nJINDAL: Bret, thank you for having me.\n\nBAIER: Governor, first, I want to first start with the breaking news out of Vienna. The diplomats are suggesting that there may be a deal here that could be announced as soon as tomorrow, an Iran nuclear deal. Your reaction?\n\nJINDAL: Look, I think a bad deal is worse than no deal. What we're hearing is that we're not going to get any time, anywhere inspections. What we're hearing is Iran will keep thousands of centrifuges. I fear this administration could start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Sunni countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are likely to going to want their own nuclear capabilities. May buy that from Pakistan. This would be a threat to Israel, to Europe, to America. I hope Secretary Clinton will evolve her views as she has evolved on other issues, and come against this very bad deal. I know she's the architect of President Obama's failed foreign policy, but this has to transcend partisan politics. We're talking about an existential threat to the region, to the United States. Never mind the fact that we're not even asking Iran to recognize Israel, to cut off ties to terrorism, to release American prisoners. I'm just talking about giving up enriched uranium, giving up all their centrifuges, anytime, anywhere inspections. Those are the basic tenants of a basic deal. And it doesn't look like we're getting any of those things.\n\nBAIER: Governor, you spend a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. You're out with a prebuttal of her economic speech this week. You said last week if you want to peek into the future with Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, then look at what's happening to Greece today. Seeing what's happening to Greece today, do you really believe that Hillary Clinton wants the U.S. to become Greece?\n\nJINDAL: Bret, look, a couple of things. She'll unveil her plans tomorrow. We already know what it is going to say. It is going to be more taxes, more government spending, more regulations. It's feeding a greedier and greedier government that's going to swallow up the private sector economy. There's never enough money or power for the government, according to the left.\n\nGive Bernie Sanders credit. At least he's willing to call himself a socialist. Hillary and President Obama are taking us down that same path, turning the American dream into the European nightmare.\n\nYou look at Greece. So they have too high taxes, too many regulations, underfunded pension systems, a slow growth in the private sector economy. That's what we have under President Obama. That's what we'd have under Secretary Clinton.\n\nBill Clinton said the era of big government was over. That was the most dangerous lie he told, much more dangerous than anything he ever said about Monica Lewinsky. So yes, I do worry that Secretary Clinton's policies are more of the same we've seen under President Obama. And Greece gave us democracy, and now they're showing us how to kill it. Let's not follow their path.\n\nBAIER: Governor, you have economic problems at home. Your approval rating in Louisiana has hovered around 30 percent, stemming largely from how you handled a deficit of about $1.6 billion, a budget shortfall. And you are waiting to hear whether Louisiana will lose some of its credit rating, will be downgraded a bit. Why should anyone look at your economic record and say that's what I want for the nation?\n\nJINDAL: Well, Bret, we actually measure prosperity on how people are doing in the real world, not the government sector. So in Louisiana, we have balanced our budget eight years in a row without raising taxes. Largest tax cut in our state's history. Income tax cut. Secondly, we have cut our state budget 26 percent, $9 billion. Cut over 30,000 fewer state government bureaucrats. We've actually had eight credit upgrades. Our highest credit rating in decades. We've got more people working than ever before in Louisiana's history, earning a higher income than ever before. We reversed 25 years of out-migration, seven years in a row of in-migration. Actually, you look at Louisiana's economy, we have got $60 billion, 90,000 jobs coming into our state because of economic development wins.\n\nYou're right, the left doesn't like what I've done because they say we've cut too much in government. Prosperity is measured in the real world, not the government world, and that's the choice we face in 2016.\n\nBAIER: Governor, the way you've done that, you've tried to pass a plan -- you passed a plan that many looked at as a way to keep a presidential campaign promise by not raising taxes. In consultation with Grover Norquist, with the Americans for Tax Reform. The Citizens for Tax Justice explained it this way, where the revenue came from. How a governor can raise taxes without violating a no-tax pledge. \"Governor Jindal has created a Rube Goldberg-like budget gimmick. Governor Jindal passed a massive increase in college fees, which he then exactly offset with the new tax credit, resulting in no actual increase in costs for students. Because college fee increases do not technically count as a tax under Grover Norquist's formula, Governor Jindal could claim that the tax credit, half of his plan, was a substantial new tax cut. Jindal could then sign an increase in the actual taxes, including cigarette taxes and other levies, without violating the pledge under the dubious claim that the tax portion of this package was revenue neutral.\"\n\nIsn't that, Governor, the kind of stuff that Republicans hate about Washington?\n\nJINDAL: Bret, a couple of things. One, I'm proud that we found a tax credit, a tax cut for working families paying tuition. Look, in a lot of states, tuition is going up. In Louisiana, we have the second lowest tuition in the South. We're one of the best states when it comes to students graduating with student debt. This is a huge problem nationally.\n\nSecondly, I would match my record against anybody in terms of actually cutting government. We're not slowing the growth rate. We've actually cut government. Our budget is 9 billion smaller than when we took office. We're not talking about 30,000 positions. 30,000 fewer people working for state government than the day I took office. In D.C., even the Republicans talk about just slowing the growth rate of government. We've actually cut the size of government. We've actually grown the private sector economy. I know the left always wants to raise taxes. That's not the way to answer our problems. In Louisiana, we privatized our state charity hospital system. We've got statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child instead of the child following the dollars. In New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools. Doubling the number doing reading and math on grade level in five years. I think those are the kinds of conservative reforms -- we need a doer, not a talker. There are a lot of Republicans that talk about --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBAIER: I understand that. I (inaudible) go to the specifics, and some of it people glaze over. But when it's budget specifics and you are doing one thing and talking about one thing, just so that you can say that you didn't raise a tax, but it's a fee, isn't that stuff that Republicans hate?\n\nJINDAL: Bret, no, there's actually a tax credit -- there's a tax cut for families whose kids are going to universities in Louisiana. That's an actual tax credit. That's a tax cut. Bottom line is, the record is clear. Our budget is smaller than when we started. We have cut taxes, not raised taxes. We have got more people working in the private sector. What we don't see happening in D.C. is look, they said give us the Republican majority and they would repeal Obamacare, balance the budget, and cut federal spending. That's not happening in D.C.\n\nBAIER: One last thing, Governor. How do you break through? Because you're at the bottom of the polls now. How do you break through to get on that stage, for example, in Cleveland?\n\nJINDAL: Look, I think we've got to embrace our principles, run on our conservative principles. The reality is, Jeb Bush says we have got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general. I disagree with that. That is the left telling us that we can't be conservatives, we've got to get the left and the media to like us. That's the establishment telling us we've got to get the left and the media to like us. That doesn't work. Why not say we're going to secure the border, repeal Obamacare, shrink the size of the government, grow the private sector economy, invest in our military, stand with Israel. Let's embrace our principles. Let's give people a real alternative to this path toward socialism, this path toward turning the American dream into the European nightmare, and let's elect a doer, not a talker. We've already got a first-term senator in the White House. Let's elect someone who has actually done things. I've done that in Louisiana. I'll do it in D.C. I'll do and say the things you're not supposed to be able to do and say.\n\nBAIER: Governor Jindal, thanks for joining us from Iowa.\n\nJINDAL: Thank you, Bret.\n\nBAIER: When we come back, Donald Trump is drawing scrutiny for his comments on immigration, but also drawing large crowds on the campaign trail. We'll bring back the panel to discuss the Trump effect on the GOP next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: The polls just came out and I'm tied with Jeb Bush. And I said, oh, that's too bad, how can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible. He's terrible. He's weak on immigration. You know, the sanctuary cities, did you know he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can you believe this? I didn't know that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: Donald Trump referencing his rise in the polls that shows him in a close race with Jeb Bush before a crowd of thousands Saturday in Phoenix. And we're back now with the panel. Brit, I talked to Jeb Bush earlier this week in New Hampshire. I asked him about Donald Trump. Take a quick listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: Donald Trump, is he bad for the GOP?\n\nJEB BUSH, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I already stated my views about Donald Trump.\n\nBAIER: You're done?\n\nBUSH: I'm done.\n\nBAIER: You're through?\n\nBUSH: I'm through. I gave my views. I just think that we need to be much more hopeful and optimistic about our ideology. We have the winning ideology. Limited government, personal responsibility, individual liberty creates more prosperity and more advantages than any other form of political philosophy. We should focus on that and not get into a food fight that only brings energy to someone who I doubt will be president and is not a constructive force for our party.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: Not a constructive force for our party, Brit.\n\nHUME: Well, I take it as that's kind of like calling him terrible, which is what Trump called him. Look, there's a segment of the Republican electorate that's been present for some time that's angrier with the mainstream GOP leadership in Congress and on the campaign trail than it is with the Democrats, at least in terms of what you hear these people saying. Donald Trump has captivated them for the moment. And he, and by doing so, he's basically eclipsed Ted Cruz, who was their previous horse.\n\nHe will have a run. But I think the chickens will come home to roost sooner or later. It will turn out people will begin to realize he hasn't long been a Republican. In fact, for many years he gave more money to Democrats, praised Hillary Clinton, told -- said that Mitt Romney was too mean on immigration for taking positions weaker than the one that he's taken now, and over time his moment will fade. It will take a while. He's got a lot of money. He will be with us a while. And he could be a third-party threat.\n\nBAIER: That's really something. His -- it's there now. His moment is there now. He's burning hot.\n\nPACE: He is. And we're in a phase in the campaign where name recognition goes a long way, certainly. I think the bigger problem for the rest of the Republican field right now is exactly what you saw in your interview with Jeb Bush. That they're going to continue to be asked about things that Trump says, and even people like Jeb Bush who want to try to avoid restating things they've already said, are going to have to come back again and say it one more time, and it's going to pull them off of the messages they are trying to present to voters, that in Bush's case tries to be more hopeful, more optimistic.\n\nBAIER: Karl, isn't there something here, though, that suggests that this anti-establishment, anti-politician on both sides of the party, is striking a cord?\n\nROVE: Look, there are -- I would define them slightly differently than Brit, but I think he's got the -- people are angry about the condition of the country and angry that Republicans haven't been able to stop Obama dead. And it's -- they are there. He appeals to that. But he -- right now he's getting the shoppers. Take a look at where he's coming in the polls. He's taking it from Ted Cruz, from Mike Huckabee. Everybody has had their moment, and they've had their moment by getting these people who are shopping around. And are they ultimately going to settle on him? I doubt it. Fox News poll says that of all Americans, 30 percent think he's honest and trustworthy, and 44 percent do not. By comparison, Hillary Clinton is at 45-52. In a Fox poll, 64 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of conservatives and 55 percent of Tea Partiers said that he was a side show, not a serious candidate. He has got a lot to do to overcome that. I doubt that he does. But he does represent a threat for a third party. You'll notice how artfully his people are saying it now. Every one of them (inaudible). What third party? Why would we? We're winning. Which is different than no, we would never go third party. So there is a threat to the Republicans from this. No doubt about it.\n\nBAIER: He's answered the question straight on, saying he would consider it.\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, which is, you know, Ross Perot all over again, who got I believe 19 or 20 percent of the vote back when.\n\nThe thing about Trump is, look, this is a big field. So everything Karl said I just want to underline. You know, like 60 percent of Republicans say they don't trust this guy and wouldn't have anything to do with him. But we have got a big field. You only need so much. He has got name I.D., he's got money, and he's to the right of everybody else, which is why he's taking away from Cruz.\n\nHUME: On what? On immigration?\n\nWILLIAMS: No, no, no, taking away from Cruz in terms of support.\n\nHUME: I thought you said he's to the right of everybody, on what?\n\nWILLIAMS: He's to the right of everybody, but specifically on immigration at the moment. But my point is, guess what? If in this larger field, we go down to super Tuesday next year, Brit, this guy could still be around.\n\nROVE: He's going to hurt the people that he's hurting now if he stays in the race. He'll keep hurting them, which means that the Ted Cruz and the Mike Huckabees and to a lesser extents, the Ben Carsons and Marco Rubio, to a lesser extent, they are not going to be able to get liftoff, and it's going to end up being him versus a couple of others who do get liftoff.\n\nWILLIAMS: So interesting to me that he hangs around like this at a time when Jeb Bush is raising money, you would know a lot about this, out of the roof, at historic levels.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROVE: -- right here at the beginning. We got seven months until the primary. We have got plenty of time.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHUME: It's a good idea to remember what happened in 2012, when the mantle of front runner passed on an almost weekly basis from one candidate to another. Newt Gingrich had two moments in the spotlight. Herman Cain shot up to No. 1.\n\nPACE: Michele Bachmann.\n\nHUME: Rick Perry when he first entered the race shot up to No. 1. This is a stage when sentiment is soft. People are fickle. And Donald Trump is having his moment. Whether he's a staying power is to be doubted.\n\nBAIER: Last word, Julie, getting on that stage in Cleveland, pretty important.\n\nPACE: It's a huge deal to be on that debate stage, where I think it will be most interesting to watch. Donald Trump can take a shot at opponents, but he does not take shots at him very well. Watch how he reacts in that kind of situation.\n\nBAIER: Panel, thank you. I bet it's not the last time we talk about that. That's it today. I'll see you tomorrow for \"Special Report\" on Fox News Channel, 6:00 p.m. Eastern, 3:00 Pacific. And you can catch more of our contender series profile of Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on Tuesday. Have a great week.

    "text":"Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes sit on opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in U.S. elections.A deluge of campaign cash is playing a significant role in Kentucky's Senate race thus far.The money raised by the campaigns and outside groups is expected to top the $100 million mark and go down as the most expensive in U.S. history.More than any lawmaker, McConnell is the face of loosening\u2014if not, eliminating\u2014campaign finance regulations.For over a decade the GOP leader has espoused that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals.In a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system.\"Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign,\" Grimes said. \"He\u2019s the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth's airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enough\u2014our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\"Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left's apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court's dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.\"It's very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,\" says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. \"She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.\"The Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \"stop special interest billionaires,\" that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.In the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races.According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year's races.Democrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky's Senate race.McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he's raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell's approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling.Former FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven't always worked out for candidates.\"One reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it's not that effective in directly advancing a candidate's interest,\" he says.\"A lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let's say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We've seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.\"Grimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell's money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads.The McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position.\"Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,\" McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. \"The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\"The top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads.Asked about Grimes' wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters.\"The real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,\" he says. \"And on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse.\"",

    "text":"Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.\n\nAs a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.\n\n\n\nDemonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading \"Putin is our president\" and \"Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!\" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city \u2014 essentially protecting it \u2014 after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.\n\nNow that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the \"interests of Russians\" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.\n\nI was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as \"Sevastopol\" but makes no mention of \"Ukrainian SSR,\" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.\n\nHowever, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.\n\nSurprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations \u2014 the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.\n\nMy father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.\n\nThe Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.\n\nMany people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.\n\nThe only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.\n\nThere is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.\n\nCrimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.",

    "text":"April 25, 2010 \u2014 -- TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients.\n\nJoining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome.\n\nGOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us.\n\nCORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you.\n\nTAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, \"Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.\"\n\nSenator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you?\n\nBROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that will separate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think that says it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, than anything we've seen so far.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? This is exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when a bank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should not be in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there.\n\nCORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know that certainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing what the SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation through this subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some of that has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better off waiting to see exactly what has taken place.\n\nI think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up on Wall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democrats are pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything that would have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed?\n\nGOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are a number of things that would go directly at the heart of some of these issues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, that the people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownership so that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, they themselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly not going to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations, but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going to win any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans' pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actually making significant money off of it. If that's true, I think Senator Brown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and that the Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it up for a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise before that vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to stand against proceeding to a debate?\n\nCORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sure knows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation in our financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is, I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program this morning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting, hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening.\n\nAnd I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need to address every issue in this compromise, but one that deals with derivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that deals with this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to in a bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that Sherrod Brown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bring forth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach that bipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes 60 votes to change anything.\n\nThis is something, by the way, that everyone has committed to try to do, and that is to have this bipartisan agreement before it goes to the floor. I think it's important that we do so.\n\nTAPPER: So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans will block the motion to proceed to debating this bill?\n\nCORKER: I think that's very likely. And I do want to say that we voted this bill, 1336 pages, we voted it out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement.\n\nSo again, we just want to see what was stated honored. And I know Sherrod Brown and Austan both know I want to see a bill. But I think, again, having this template done first is very, very important. It's very likely, I think it's almost a given, that if we don't reach that bipartisan agreement, that Republicans will probably want to put in place something that allows those negotiations to keep going for a while until we do that. So yes, 41 Republicans in my opinion would block it unless we reached this agreement, which we've all stated needs to occur.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Brown, let me ask you a question about the legislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Senator Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?\n\nBROWN: Yes, it does. It can do it better, and Senator Corker was part of the negotiations that deal with the resolution authority. But I also--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Just to interject, the resolution authority is for the federal government to come in, and if there is a failing financial system, to take over and liquidate that firm. I'm sorry, Senator Brown, go on.\n\nBROWN: But let me go back to something Bob just said, then I'll answer the question more specifically. You know, some Wall Street people have said the longer they can delay this, the more chance they can kill it. And I just don't want to see it delayed. We've been -- two years ago was the Bear Stearns problem. Ever since then, Senator Dodd in November put out a working draft. He then put teams together, including Senator Corker and Senator Warner and Gregg and others and Senator Dodd and Shelby, and it's -- and Senator Reed, and Jack Reed was part of that too -- so we've been working on this for a long time.\n\nI hope that tomorrow night when we have a vote -- all we're asking tomorrow night is 60 votes. We need a Republican or two or three to simply say, let's move forward and debate, and then Bob Corker and I and others can offer any kinds of amendments we want. So I hope that they will not en masse -- and put it this way, I wish there were more Bob Corkers in the Senate Republican caucus, because he's been very open with negotiations. And then Senator Shelby and Senator -- Minority Leader McConnell pulled them back, I think on behalf of Wall Street lobbyists.\n\nBut put that aside, in terms of too-big-to-fail, we do have this resolution authority. It's well done, written by Senator Corker and Senator Dodd and some others bipartisanly. I think we need to do more to prevent too big, though. Too-big-to-fail is too big, and my amendment that Senator Kaufman from Delaware and I are offering next week or the week after will basically say that we'll put some limits on the size of these banks.\n\nLet me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake. Fifteen years ago, the six -- the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP, and that's too -- we've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.\n\nTAPPER: And Austan, Senator Brown is going to introduce an amendment that would cap the amount a bank can borrow to finance operations at 2 percent of GDP, 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Wouldn't that actually stop too-big-to-fail by preventing these banks from being too big? And why isn't the administration behind that?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, the president is totally committed and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore. We can open -- we're open to negotiating details obviously as we start getting into it. They're complicated. Some of these financial risks are more like worms where you could chop them in half, but it doesn't kill them, it just gives you two different worms. Bear Stearns, AIG, they weren't the biggest, they were just the most dangerous, and we've got to come at this from every side.\n\nLook, we're open to looking at ending too-big-to-fail on the size angle, on the what risky investments they're allowed to take, looking at the derivatives component so that AIG-like, they can't threaten to blow up the whole world because of -- because they have some of this $600 trillion pool of derivatives that we know virtually nothing about, that are in the dark. All of that ends when we sign this bill. If you look at the bill and take a step back -- I don't know much about the legislative strategies that are going on in the Senate. They are important. I do know that the president has laid out what this bill does, is we're going to end bailouts, we're going to hold accountable the people that get into the messes. So if they get in trouble, they fail. All we're going to do is pay funeral expenses, and we're going to have the strongest consumer protections ever in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Let me stop you right there, because you said that we're going to hold accountable the people that get us into these messes. But Senator Corker, I think one of the problems that a lot of the American people have with bailouts and with this legislation is that they feel that after these firms fail, or are propped up by the U.S. taxpayer, they take billions of taxpayer dollars, then the CEOs and the board members drive off in their Austin Martins to their $20 million houses in the Hamptons with their $500 million in the bank, and there's no accountability whatsoever. Is there anything in this bill that provides any personal accountability for these CEOs?\n\nCORKER: Before I answer that, let me refer to something Senator Brown said. I -- nobody pulled me back from negotiations. The fact is that Senator Dodd, and he said this publicly, left me at the altar. And the reason was, as we negotiated, Democrats were being lost, and I think he wanted to get the bill out of committee on a party-line vote. I mean, he has stated that publicly. So nobody has pulled me back. I'm my own person and I want to get a good bill here.\n\nBut back to the question you're asking. There is no question, and I think that first of all, I plan to offer changes to this resolution authority that say that, if a large entity like this has to go through this resolution where in essence they're liquidated in an orderly way, I think that everything that the executive team and the board members have earned through this company over the last five years needs to be clawed back. In other words, there needs to be some penalties assessed to the management that have caused the country to have to go through this orderly liquidation process. So absolutely, I will be offering an amendment that deals with that, so that we're taking back, we're clawing back all the earnings that management has made out of this firm, if it has to go through orderly liquidation. I think that's very appropriate, and certainly I'm going to be doing that on the floor if it doesn't make it into the base bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can the White House get behind that clawback provision? Are you being out-populisted by Republicans?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, look, in the bill now -- the president went to Cooper Union this last week to revisit the spot where more than two years ago, he went and said we need to have fundamental reform--\n\nTAPPER: But there is no clawback in this bill?\n\nGOOLSBEE: There is a requirement that they're all fired. If you get to that point, all the management is fired--\n\nTAPPER: So they take their $500 million to their home in the Hamptons.\n\nGOOLSBEE: -- all the shareholders are wiped out. Well, look, as I say, on any details, we're open to looking at negotiating the details of how we carry out the president's principles. But if negotiation -- and Senator Corker, to his credit, is not in this camp -- but if the negotiators are going to come forward more as a delaying tactic and we're just going to put in hundreds of amendments and try to keep this going so as to stall, delay and kill reform, that's not going to happen. This is going to pass.\n\nCORKER: Well, let me--\n\nTAPPER: One of the big -- let me just move on to another subject if I could, but we will get back to you, Senator Corker. One of the big debates going on within the Democratic caucus is how strong the derivative legislation should be. Derivatives are these risky bets that big money men and women make on whether or not an industry will rise or fall in value, and it's a way to hedge a lot of risk.\n\nSenator Brown, you are in favor of Senator Lincoln's provision, Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas. She wants to say, if you're a bank and you have federally insured money, you have to separate these derivatives traders. It's too risky what they do. We should not have any connection with taxpayer insured money. Do you think that the Democrats are going to put that in the bill? And if not, why not?\n\nBROWN: Well, I hope so and I think so. I -- this goes back to really your first question on the conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that you really can't serve two masters. You can't serve your clients and serve yourself and play these transactions one off against another. And I think that these -- anything we do in this bill, whether it's consumer protection standalone -- I hope that the Consumer Protection Agency, whether it's regulation of derivatives, whether it's too-big-to-fail, whether it's the Volcker rule separating out proprietary trading and, as I say, from standard banking practices. Any of those conflicts of interests, we have to address in this bill, and I think that -- I think that Senator Lincoln and her draft in the Agriculture Committee that we voted out last week, we got one Republican supporting it, Senator Grassley did. And I think that was a good sign. I think it means that there will be a number of Republicans that are as open-minded as Senator Corker, that will want to move forward Monday night.\n\nAnd again, just to let us begin the debate. I mean, the Monday vote is going to be -- are we going to start the debate or are we going to shut it down and continue negotiating, negotiating, negotiating. I, to me, the legislative process is, you put a bill on the floor and then Bob Corker offers his amendment that I like that he just mentioned, in terms of in the resolution authority, what to do with these executives that brought us there. I offer my amendment on too-big-to-fail means too big. Dozens of other amendments will be offered, we'll see what happens, and then we vote on a bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can you get behind Senator Lincoln's provision to separate derivatives trading from banks that have federally insured deposits?\n\nGOOLSBEE: If you take a step back, this issue of derivatives is totally central. Now, three years ago, virtually no one in America had even heard of derivatives, or if they had, they had nightmares of their, you know, college math class or something. The fact is that there are now $600 trillion of derivatives that are trading in the dark, that we know virtually nothing about and are unregulated. And it's not just a party that's taking place on Wall Street that has no impact on America. They're exactly the things that threatened to blow up the entire financial system with AIG. So the president's completely committed that we are going to bring the $600 trillion out into the open and under the regulatory umbrella.\n\nNow, I think we made great progress that in both the Dodd and Lincoln's versions of what would happen with derivatives, we purged a bunch of the loopholes that some of the banks had gotten put into the bills before. The president is not going to allow putting loopholes in that let these $600 trillion get back into the dark and threaten the whole system.\n\nWe can work on the -- so the--\n\nTAPPER: But you guys--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: -- don't support separating it, though, right?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, there are several very technical aspects of difference between the Lincoln bill and the Dodd bill--\n\nTAPPER: It's not really actually that technical, whether or not--\n\nGOOLSBEE: I don't agree with that.\n\nTAPPER: It's whether or not commercial banks should be able to do this. Senator Corker, I hear you giggling--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: You think Senator Lincoln's provision goes a little too far, right? Senator Corker?\n\nCORKER: Are you talking to--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Yes, yes, of course, Senator Corker.\n\nCORKER: Yes. Yes, I mean, I think what -- I think what Austan is saying is he doesn't support it. And I don't either. Let me say this, I want to see as much traded through clearinghouses as possible. I absolutely agree that that needs to occur. We don't want to force those things that are not liquid to be traded on the clearinghouse, but I'm on the side of let's get as much as possible.\n\nThe fact is that Senator Brown is in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. I'm in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. And what people don't I think appreciate so much is that all of these tools are used for capital formation. They help companies hedge their risk. They help companies create capital, and I think if we start drawing lines in the sand where we take these tools away, what we really do is hamper companies' ability to access capital. So I don't think separation is appropriate. I do think clearing as much as possible so that on a daily basis, if somebody is money bad, they have to put money up to be money good or neutral, so that we don't end up in the kind of situation we have with AIG. But I think it hampers our ability, again, to create great companies if we just create an absolute separation.\n\nTAPPER: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have. It was a great debate, and I really thank you, Senator Corker in Chattanooga, Senator Brown in Cincinnati and Austan Goolsbee here in the studio. Thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.\n\nAs our roundtable takes their seats, take a look at how Saturday Night Live portrayed the president's speech on Thursday, pitching reform to Wall Street executives.\n\nTAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable, as always. George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Paul Krugman of the New York Times and Alexis Glick, former vice president at Fox Business News. Thank you all for joining us.\n\nGeorge, does this legislation end too-big-to-fail?\n\nWILL: No, because that's not the problem. It's -- we all sort of sympathize with Sherrod Brown and Senator Kaufman's idea that if it's too big to fail, it's too big to exist. The problem is it's not scale, it's connectedness that poses so-called system risk. And what people are arguing about is whether or not they have accurately located risk to the entire system.\n\nThis is an unusual argument. Usually in Washington when there's controversy about a bill, the two sides agree about what the bill does but not whether it ought to be done. In this case, there's an argument about whether or not the bill will actually do what it sets out to do.\n\nBoth sides want to guarantee the obliteration of certain kinds of failed firms. They want the management to go and they want shareholder equity to disappear. So it's a competition to see who can be most beastly to these bad companies. And the question is whether or not this happens.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia, it's unclear right now if there's going to be a bipartisan compromise, but you heard Senator Corker say that the negotiations should continue. You don't really have a lot of faith in that.\n\nTUCKER: No, and the Democrats don't either, for good reason. We saw this tactic used with health care reform, when Max Baucus was given months to negotiate with Republicans. At the end of the day there wasn't a single Senate Republican voting for health care reform. So, you know, Mitch McConnell came out just a few weeks ago and said, let's start over with this financial reform bill. That was the very same tactic used with health care reform. So Democrats need to be leery of this idea of negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. It gives the lobbyists time to lobby more, give more campaign contributions, and it gives the Republicans time to foment opposition by mischaracterizing the bill. So I think Chris Dodd is very leery.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Can I interject for one second on the campaign contributions, and I'll come to you in a second, Paul. But the Center for Responsive Politics did a study of campaign contributions, and in this cycle, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors are giving much more to Democrats than to Republicans. $65 million to $51 million. Paul, do you think the Democratic Party is too close to Wall Street?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, it has been in the past for sure. No question that in the late '90s, the Clinton team -- some of whom are now in the administration -- were way too close to Wall Street. They believed that these were wise men who knew what they were doing. And no, at this point, it's the party in power, of course, is going to be getting a lot more contributions. It's kind of -- that's not too surprising.\n\nLet me say a couple of things here. Anyone who says we need to be bipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been trying to stop reform with possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history of politics, which is the claim that having regulation of the banks is actually bailing out the banks. And basically, the argument boils down to saying that what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolish the fire department. Because then people will know that they can't let their buildings burn in the first place, right? It's incredible.\n\nSo anyone who says bipartisan, should say, you know, bipartisan doesn't include the Senate minority leader. But, you know, I agree with George, actually, believe it or not. Too big to fail per se is not the problem. The Great Depression was made possible by the failure of the Bank of the United States, which despite its name, was a Bronx-based institution that was the 28th largest financial institution in the United States at the time, and yet brought the whole system down.\n\nBut what we are getting now in this bill is a way to have graceful failure of big institutions, right? We know how to deal with small banks. The FDIC seized seven banks last week that were on the verge of failing and let them, you know, liquidated them gracefully, but we don't have a way of dealing with complex, you know, what we call shadow banking institutions like Lehman or Citigroup. And this bill would give you that. So it would give you the ability to do for big, complicated financial institutions what we've been doing routinely for small ones, and that does -- so it doesn't end the too big, but it may deal with the fail bit.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, you, unlike a lot of business journalists, actually have worked in business. You've done trading at Goldman Sachs, at Morgan Stanley. What do you think of this regulation bill? Do you think the derivatives monitoring and separation that Senator Lincoln is trying to do, do you think that goes too far?\n\nGLICK: Well, look, bottom line is, I think when you look at the derivative equation, do we need transparency? Should there be a central clearing facility? Absolutely. It is without a doubt the wild west. It is all about that shadow banking market, that black market. We have not been able to see who is on the other side of that transaction.\n\nI do believe that it's going too far to say that large financial institutions cannot have a derivative business. Believe you me, I don't want to see one American deposit in this country used as a tool to go out on a proprietary basis for a firm's capital to go out and trade in derivatives. I don't like that. But when you come back to this too big to fail, just to pick up on what you said, the FDIC has done a phenomenal job throughout this financial crisis. No depositor has lost a dime. They've been able to wind down financial institutions in a very, very smart and effective way. The question here on resolution authority is what--\n\nTAPPER: The ability of the government -- I told you I'll do this -- the ability of the government to step in and wind down a financial institution that's failing. Go.\n\nGLICK: Good job! The bill -- the question here is all those other institutions who have a financial arm, as we talked about earlier. It's the GM situations where they have a finance arm, it's the GE Capitals of the world. Where do these guys fit into this equation when they may be in the manufacturing business or in other business?\n\nWILL: That's precisely what worries Republicans. They think this is a thin end of an enormous wedge that is going to get the government deeper into treating capital and credit in this country as a public utility, to be priced and allocated here in Washington, which is, they think, inevitably a recipe for something like crony capitalism. Because you have somewhat not slippery, but open-textured definitions. Non-bank financial institution. Well, GMAC gets General Motors brought under TARP, and in this case, GE Capital would get all of General Electric, or would it? We don't know. Would it be a segment of General Electric brought under this bill?\n\nKRUGMAN: And yet there's no alternative. Meaning if we only protect banks in the traditional sense, which are big marble buildings with rows of tellers, you're missing 60 percent of the modern banking system. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of things out there, money market funds, repo. (inaudible), but things that functionally play the same role as bank deposits, that can destabilize the economy the same way as bank deposits, and so we have to bring those under the umbrella. Now, we can quibble with details, but something like this has to be done.\n\nTAPPER: Let me just interject for one second. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, our roundtable will take up Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants and what will the impact be on immigration reform. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJAY LENO: He just played golf for the 32nd time in his presidency. He sent more troops to Iraq, wants more oil drilling, gave billions to Wall Street. Rush Limbaugh said he wanted a Republican president, he got one.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER: Coming up next, more of the \"Roundtable\" and of course the \"Sunday Funnies.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBREWER: I have decided to sign Senate bill 1070 into law. Order related violence and crimes due to illegal immigration are critically important issue for the people of our state.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are angry. People feel held down.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Federal government isn't doing anything for us. The state has to do something.\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Our border is not secure, our citizens are not safe.\n\nOBAMA: The failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Some sound from the heated debate over Arizona's new immigration law. Fodder for us here on our \"Roundtable.\" We're joined as always by George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\" Paul Krugman of the \"New York Times,\" and former vice president of FOX Business News, Alexis Glick.\n\nThat's a mouth full but I got it every time. Let me start before we discuss this bill and what it actually does by going into one of the most controversial provisions in this new law, Arizona Senate bill 1070. \"For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official, where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, s reasonable attempt shall be made when practicable to determine the immigration status of the person.\"\n\n\"Reasonable suspicion\" that the person is an alien. What does that mean, George?\n\nWILL: Well, the Fourth Amendment says there should be no unreasonable searches and seizures, and we've generated volumes of case law trying to sort out what that means over the last century or so. So it's not clear what that means. Let's say this about Arizona. They have 460,000, an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants there. So before Washington lectures Arizonans on irresponsibility, perhaps Washington ought to attend to the central attribute of national sovereignty which is to control the borders. We are the only developed nation in the world with a 2,000 mile border with an undeveloped country and we have a magnet of a welfare state to the north.\n\nSo this is not Arizona's fault. Beyond that, this should be said however. Reasonable suspicion is going to put upon the police of Arizona a terribly difficult job. This is what the governor said. \"We must enforce the law evenly and without regard to skin color, accent or social status.\" I don't know how do you that.\n\nTAPPER: Well Cynthia, how do you do that? The governor put out an executive order saying that there should be no racial order that there should be no racial profiling with this law. But if you're a police man and you've been told -- and by the way, you can be sued now under this law if you're not doing enough, if the citizens are convinced you're not doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration. If you're a policeman, what's enough? What's reasonable to think somebody might be an illegal immigrant?\n\nTUCKER: Well Jake, several law enforcement agencies have actually opposed the bill. Not only for that reason because they have no idea what it means to say reasonable suspicion. A California Republican has said you can tell an illegal immigrant by the shoes they wear. Of course this is an invitation to racial profiling. Everyone with a Spanish surname, everyone with a certain look, you may or may not be Latino. There are people in my family who look as if they could be Latino. It harkens back to apartheid where all black people in South Africa were required to carry documents in order to move from one part of town to another.\n\nAnd let me just say this about Arizona's problems with the border, it is absolutely true that Arizona has problems with the border. A rancher was killed apparently by drug smugglers. But this has absolutely no bearing on that problem. All it does is open the doors for harassment of citizens.\n\nTAPPER: Let's you talk about that rancher for a second. His name was Robert Krentz and he was killed in March. Here's a friend of him, Steve Brophy, talking about his friend's death.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEVE BROPHY, KRENTZ'S FRIEND: You cannot allow a border in our country that is akin in lawlessness to that of west Waziristan in Pakistan. It's simply intolerable, not just for Rob Krentz and not just for the Krentz family but for her entire country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Doesn't he have a point, Paul? I mean this is federal failure at the border.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, we have never put in enough money is basically what it comes down to enforce the border control. It's not a deep issue of principle, it's just a question of resources. People have been willing to be very -- talk tough about it but actually not willing to do reasonable stuff in terms of enforcement. And it's going to be a problem. But what I want to go back to here is not just apartheid issues, but think about a different way.\n\nWe have these massive protests in this country about alleged authoritarian tendencies that we are going to have some kind of -- inside the Obama\/Hitler stuff -- the idea that the government is encroaching too much in our lives.\n\nAnd now all of the sudden, we have by pretty much the same people, demanding that we set up a system that will turn us into one of those apocryphal foreign authoritarian regimes where the police are saying hand over your papers, right? A world where you constantly have to prove who you are. And yes, it will be racial profiling but who knows what else? I mean, some people take me I look like President Lula of Brazil, so I might end up being pulled over when I'm on my morning walk, right?\n\nTAPPER: I think you're much better looking than the president of Brazil.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: But you know, it's interesting that you say that, because you are not the only one to evoke that, let me see your papers thing.\n\nKRUGMAN: Right.\n\nTAPPER: Cardinal Roger Mahoney on his blog wrote, quote, \"American people are fair-minded and respectful. I can't imagine Arizonans now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation.\"\n\nAnd now, Alexis, we have Senator Harry Reid and President Obama talking about immigration reform again. We thought it was dead, we thought it wasn't going to be brought up, but it looks like this is going to be a big issue in Washington.\n\nGLICK: You know, I think at first glance, most people say, hey, wait a second. We're been trying to tackle too much too quickly. But the bottom line here is if -- this is a bill that will be the catalyst, if what has happened in Arizona is the thing that gets people moving in Washington, D.C. to address things like the border, then so be it.\n\nI saw Senator Lindsey Graham came out the other day and said, oh, wait a second, I've been working, I'm not going to show up at the conference on cap-and-trade because we said cap-and-trade is first before we're going to address -- or climate change is first before we're going to address immigration. The bottom line, we have to address immigration. 11 million immigrants in this country. We have got an unemployment rate in this country at 26-, 27-year high. We have to address citizens and what they are going to take of the piece of the pie, what they should get in addition to what taxes they should get, what services they're going to be offered.\n\nThis is an issue that has been plaguing us. We have got to address it.\n\nWILL: Again, in defense of Arizona, large majority of Arizonans support this bill and a large majority of Arizonans are not, by definition, the fringe of the state. They are temperate, decent people with a huge problem.\n\nWhat the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime. Now, the Arizona police -- and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are not bad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind of difficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds of judgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despair altogether their ability to do this in a professional way.\n\nTAPPER: And we should point out, some police organizations in Arizona do support it, although Cynthia, it's interesting, President Obama had this to say on the North Lawn of the White House, or, I'm sorry, in the Rose Garden of the White House the other day, even before the law was passed.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I've instructed members of my administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation. But if we continue to fail to act at a federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Obviously that's a call for immigration reform, but in addition, is he asking the Justice Department to look into whether or not they should block this law?\n\nTUCKER: No, I think they are looking -- first of all, I think the Justice Department lawyers and the Civil Rights Division probably spent the weekend trying to figure out what they can do, looking at the bill itself, the law now, and trying to figure out where there might be civil rights violations. Unreasonable search and seizure is one place for them to look.\n\nBut the Justice Department doesn't have to do anything. There will be other organizations that have already said that they are planning lawsuits against this. So it will be in court shortly.\n\nLet me say this about immigration reform, though. If we thought health care reform was divisive, this is going to be an all-out battle, and will even create fissures in the Democratic Party. That's why Speaker Pelosi has said we will act, but only if the Senate acts first.\n\nTAPPER: She's no fool. The Senate -- President Obama has been saying -- pointing out that there were 11 Republican senators who supported immigration reform in 2007 when it failed, and suggesting that they need to support it now. I don't think they're going to support it, though.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, politically, though, this is one of those issues that cuts right through the middle of both parties. The Democrats, it's on the one hand, Democrats tend to be pro-labor, which means they are worried about immigration; on the other hand, they tend to be -- it is the party that now gets most of the Hispanic votes, it's the party that generally is for inclusiveness. So the Democrats are divided. Many of them divided within their own hearts. It's an interesting thing, it's not so much different wings of the party as each individual Democrat tends to be kind of torn about this.\n\nRepublicans are divided between the sort of cultural conservative wing, the preserve America as the way it is, and the business wing, which likes having inexpensive immigrant labor. So this is one heck of an issue. It's going to -- it's deeply divisive among both parties, which is one reason not to rush it, to push it at the top of the agenda right now.\n\nI'm kind of upset at the notion that this might push climate change off this year, because we don't do climate change legislation. I'm ready for that one, George. If we don't do that this year, we won't do it for quite a few years to come.\n\nGLICK: I thought one of the most interesting things is Senator McCain's stance on this, someone who talked a lot on the campaign trail and has been very vocal about needing comprehensive immigration reform. I understand he's fighting a tight race and a tight battle there, but I thought that was very telling, when you go back to what -- how will this impact the mid-term elections. Is this about what will happen to that Hispanic vote? Is this about what you need to do in these short-term elections to get the necessary votes? I thought that was a very telling sign that in the last hours, he decided to back it.\n\nWILL: But the problem, as in my judgment with health care, is that word comprehensive. Instead of making little, bite-sized, incremental improvements, we have to do everything at once. That's partly because this is all being held hostage by the immigrant advocacy groups in the country. But if we would close the border, guarantee that we were not going to have serial amnesties far into the future--\n\nGLICK: So put the 3,000 troops on the border as McCain suggests.\n\nWILL: Build a fence, do what McCain suggests, and you'll find that the American people are not xenophobic, they are not irrational on the subject, but they do want this essential attribute of national sovereignty asserted.\n\nTUCKER: And where does the money come from for that, George?\n\nWILL: It's a rounding error on the GM bailout.\n\nTUCKER: Sealing the border would be much more difficult than advocates for that idea suggest. It's a very long border, 2,000 miles, George.\n\nTAPPER: We're only talking about the southern border, right? We're not trying to keep the Canadians out?\n\nTUCKER: The southern border---\n\nWILL: You're profiling.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: -- different from you and me, eh?\n\nTUCKER: And technology doesn't work that we thought we can depend on, doesn't work nearly as well as its advocates suggested either. So we're talking about people, standing up border guards, National Guard, Army troops on the border if we really want to seal it off.\n\nKRUGMAN: The truth is, in the modern world, sealing borders is a lot harder than you want to imagine. Nobody is able to keep out at least a fair amount of illegal immigration. The Europeans can't. The Japanese can't. Japan is an island, and it's very easy to tell who's not Japanese, and even so they have a lot of illegal immigrants.\n\nGLICK: But you can see to George's point of view, as I was saying to you guys before, when I sent out a message on Twitter about this and I said to people, what do you think about immigration reform? A lot of the messages I got back were from people in Arizona who say they support this bill because they see what's going on, on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNow, I don't agree with it. I think there is a very dangerous precedent being set, but what it does show you is that more and more states, particularly on the border there, are going to have to address this on their own if we don't take it up as a bigger issue.\n\nTAPPER: I want to get to one other state very, very quickly, because we only have a couple of minutes, and that is in the next week, we're going to have a decision from the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, who is running for Senate, about whether or not he's going to drop out of the race. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the former speaker of the Florida House, Marco Rubio, would wallop Crist in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 33 percent. But if Crist runs as an independent, George, Crist 32 percent; Rubio 30 percent; Democratic Congressman Kendrick Meek, 24 percent. Very quickly, isn't this his only option?\n\nWILL: No. He can lose honorably, as has happened before with other people, wait two years, and run against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Nelson. Or having experienced a 50-point swing against him in about six months, he can go off. He has already lost his campaign manager, former Senator Connie Mack. He's infuriated by vetoing an education reform bill to curry favor with the teachers unions Jeb Bush, the most popular politician in the state. This is hara-kiri on the part of this man.\n\nTAPPER: Paul, very quickly.\n\nKRUGMAN: This is the narrowing of the Republican Party. Republican Party has swung hard right. There is no room for a moderately conservative but still middle-of-the-road politician in it, and Charlie Crist has just found that out, rather late in the game I might say.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia?\n\nTUCKER: You know, he has -- his politics haven't changed. He has always worked across the aisle with Democrats. He's always been moderately conservative. But this shows how much the Republican Party in Florida has changed. It's that hug, when President Obama came to Florida to talk about the stimulus package, there was that moment in video where they did a man hug, and that is killing Charlie Crist and the Republican Party.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, very quickly, how much of this is about the stimulus, about the fact that Crist embraced the stimulus?\n\nGLICK: Absolutely bingo to me. This is the perfect example for Republicans across the country who will say, hey, look, I didn't support the stimulus package. Look at what's happening to a guy who did support it. I think that's going to be a big issue of debate here. And I also think the second issue is Tea Party. Rubio supported by the Tea Party. If the Republicans want to figure out how to embrace Tea Party candidates, here's an example.\n\nTAPPER: All right, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room on abcnews.com, where you can also check out our fact checks.",

    "text":"Scranton High School\n\nScranton, Pennsylvania\n\n2:37 P.M. EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Scranton! Thank you. (Applause.) It is good to be back in Scranton. Go, Knights! (Applause.) It is good to be here. Thank you, Principal Schaeffer, for letting us hold this little assembly here at the high school. (Laughter.) The principal was bragging about both the basketball team and the football team. I understand they\u2019re -- (applause) -- right up there? All right.\n\nThank you, Donna, for the wonderful invitation. We had a chance to visit in the Festas\u2019 living room, and just a wonderful family, and their kids are doing great. So I\u2019m really, really proud to be with all of you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you come to my house? (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What did she say? You want -- next time, your house. (Laughter.) All right? (Applause.)\n\nNow, I will say, Donna put out some really good cookies. So -- (laughter) -- I\u2019m just saying. (Laughter.) All right.\n\nNow, I also want to bring greetings from somebody you guys know pretty well -\u2013 a guy named Joe Biden. (Applause.) Joe is in Iraq as we speak, and he\u2019s visiting with our brave men and women in uniform, thanking them for their service. (Applause.) And part of the reason he\u2019s going now is because, pretty soon, we\u2019ll all get a chance to say thank you. This holiday season is going to be a season of homecomings, because by the end of December, all of our troops are going to be out of Iraq. They\u2019re going to be back home. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I mention Joe, first of all, because he loves Scranton. (Applause.) He was born here in Scranton. He spent his early years here in Scranton. This town helped make him who he is. This is a town where he and so many of you grew up with a faith in an America where hard work matters. Where responsibility matters. Where if you stay true to those things, you can get ahead. Where no matter who you are, no matter what you look like -\u2013 whether you own a factory or you work on the factory floor \u2013- America is a place where you can make it if you try. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s why Joe and I ran for this office. You are why we spent so much time in this state a few years ago. Because even then, those ideas -\u2013 the idea that\u2019s at the very heart of the American Dream \u2013- felt like it was slipping away for a lot of people. It was wonderful visiting with Patrick and Donna, and we were talking about the fact that Patrick has been -- Patrick Festa has been teaching in the school system for 25 years now; Donna has been a graphic artist. But they\u2019re still worried about if the washer\/dryer goes out, or if they have to do a car repair. Things are tight. And they\u2019re pretty lucky that they\u2019ve got a good job, steady jobs. For a lot of folks, it\u2019s a lot tougher.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve gone through a difficult decade for middle-class Americans. More good jobs in manufacturing left our shores over the last decade. More of our prosperity was built on risky financial deals and homes that a lot of folks couldn\u2019t afford. And a lot of you watched your incomes fall or your wages flatline. Meanwhile, the costs of everything from college to health care were all going up. And then, after all that, the financial crisis hit because of the irresponsibility of some on Wall Street. (Applause.) And that made things a whole lot tougher.\n\nToday, we all know folks who\u2019ve spent months looking for work. We all know families making deep sacrifices just to get by. We all know young people who have gone to college, they\u2019ve taken on a bunch of debt. Now they\u2019re finding that the opportunity that they worked so hard to find is getting harder and harder to come by. So there\u2019s a sense of deep frustration among people who\u2019ve done the right thing, but don\u2019t see that hard work and that responsibility pay off. And that\u2019s not the way things are supposed to be, not here in America.\n\nBut here today with all of you, I\u2019m thinking about something that is probably Joe\u2019s favorite expression. And some of you know Joe\u2019s story. He went through some tough times when he was a kid. And his father used to tell him, Champ, when you get knocked down, you get up. You get up.\n\nAnd Scranton, we\u2019ve taken some punches these last few years. But there\u2019s one thing I know about people here in Scranton, people in Pennsylvania, and people all across America: We are tougher than the times. We are America. We get back up. We fight back. We move forward. (Applause.) We don\u2019t give up. We get back up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd even though our economic problems weren\u2019t caused overnight and so they\u2019re not going to be solved overnight -- even though it\u2019s going to take a few more years to meet all the challenges that were decades in the making -- we\u2019re fighting to make things right again. We\u2019re fighting to make sure that if you are working hard and you are carrying out your responsibilities and you\u2019re looking out for your family, that you can live a good, solid, middle-class life. That is what America is all about. And we are going to be fighting for that every day, every week, every month and every year that we\u2019re in office. (Applause.)\n\nWe want an America where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded. We\u2019re fighting to rebuild an economy that restores security for the middle class and renews opportunity for folks that are trying to get into the middle class. We\u2019re fighting to build an economy that\u2019s not based on outsourcing and tax loopholes and risky financial schemes, but one that\u2019s built to last -- one where we invest in things like education and small businesses -- (applause) -- an economy that\u2019s built on manufacturing and building things again and selling them all around the world. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to keep fighting to make our economy stronger and put our friends and neighbors back to work, to give our young people opportunities greater than the opportunities that we had. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for the last three years.\n\nBut two months ago, I sent a particular piece of legislation to Congress called the American Jobs Act. (Applause.) This is a jobs bill that will put more Americans to work, put more money back in the pockets of working families. It\u2019s contains ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share. (Applause.) And independent economists said that it would create up to 2 million jobs, and grow the economy by as much as 2 percent. And that\u2019s what we need right now.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the problem -- there is a problem. Folks in Washington don\u2019t seem to be getting the message. When this jobs bill came to a vote, Republicans in the Senate got together and they blocked it. They refused to even debate it. Even though polls showed that two-thirds of Americans of all political stripes supported the ideas in this bill, not one single Republican stepped up to say, this is the right thing to do.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Not one. But here\u2019s the good news, Scranton. Just like you don\u2019t quit, I don\u2019t quit. (Applause.) I don\u2019t quit. So I said, look, I\u2019m going to do everything that I can do without Congress to get things done. (Applause.)\n\nSo let\u2019s just take a look over the past several weeks. We said, we can\u2019t wait. We just went ahead and started taking some steps on our own to give working Americans a leg up in a tough economy. For homeowners, I announced a new policy that will help families refinance their mortgages and save thousands of dollars. (Applause.) For all the young people out here -- (applause) -- we reformed our student loan process to make it easier for more students to pay off their debts earlier. (Applause.) For our veterans out here -- and I see some veterans in the crowd -- (applause) -- we ordered several new initiatives to help our returning heroes find new jobs and get trained for those jobs. (Applause.) Because you shouldn\u2019t have to fight for a job when you come home after fighting for America -- you shouldn\u2019t have to do that. (Applause.)\n\nAnd in fact, last week I was able to sign into law two new tax breaks for businesses that hire veterans, because nobody out here who is a veteran should -- we have to make sure that they are getting the help that they need.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. President!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And by the way, I think we\u2019re starting to get, maybe, to the Republicans a little bit, because they actually voted for this veterans bill. I was glad to see that. (Applause.) I was glad that Democrats and Republicans got together with this bipartisan legislation.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a lot more to do, though, if we\u2019re going to get every American back to work who wants to work, and to rebuild an economy that works for every American, which is why we\u2019re going to give Congress another chance to do the right thing with the American Job Act. We\u2019re going to give them another chance to help working families like yours. (Applause.)\n\nLast year, both parties came together to cut payroll taxes for the typical household by $1,000. Now, that\u2019s been showing up in your paychecks each week. You may not be aware of it, because times are tight. But you actually got a tax cut of $1,000 this year. Now, I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that I\u2019m this big tax-and-spend liberal. Next time you hear that, you just remind the people who are saying it that since I\u2019ve taken office, I\u2019ve cut your taxes. (Applause.)\n\nYour taxes today -- the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office, just remember that. (Applause.) We have cut taxes for small businesses not once, not twice, but 17 times. The average family\u2019s tax burden is among the lowest it\u2019s been in the last 60 years.\n\nSo the problem is not that we\u2019ve been raising taxes. We\u2019ve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times. But here\u2019s the thing: That payroll tax cut that we passed in December of last year, it\u2019s set to expire at the end of this year, one month from now. If that happens -- if Congress doesn\u2019t act to extend this tax cut -- then most of you, the typical middle-class family, is going to see your taxes go up by $1,000 at the worst possible time. A young lady just said she can\u2019t afford that. It would be tough for you. It would also be a massive blow for the economy, because we\u2019re not fully out of the recession yet. Don\u2019t take my word for it; this is what every independent economist says. We can\u2019t let this tax cut lapse right now.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why my jobs bill -- part of the American Jobs Act was to extend this tax cut for another year. In fact, it does one better. It says, let\u2019s expand that tax cut. Instead of a $1,000 tax cut next year, the typical working family under my plan would get a tax cut of $1,500. (Applause.) Instead of it coming out of your paycheck, it would be going into your pocket. Now, that\u2019s money that you can spend on a small business right here in Scranton. If you\u2019re a small business owner, my jobs bill will cut your payroll taxes in half. So if you\u2019ve got 50 employees making $50,000 each, you\u2019d get a tax cut of nearly $80,000. That\u2019s money that you can then use to hire some more workers and get this economy moving again. That\u2019s a good thing. (Applause.)\n\nNow, this really should not be controversial. A lot of Republicans have agreed with this tax cut in the past. The Republican leader in the Senate said it would -- I\u2019m quoting here -- it would \u201cput a lot of money back in the hands of business and in the hands of individuals.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. Another Republican leader said it would help small business owners create jobs and help their employees spend more money, creating even more jobs. One Republican even called it a \u201cconservative approach to help put our economy back on track.\u201d So what\u2019s the problem?\n\nThe bad news is some of those same Republicans voted \u201cno\u201d on my jobs bill and those tax cuts. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s just because I proposed it. I don\u2019t know. They said \u201cno\u201d to cutting taxes for small business owners and working families. One of them said just two years ago that this kind of tax cut would boost job creation, and now that I\u2019m proposing it, he said we should let it expire. I mean, what happened?\n\nRepublicans say they\u2019re the party of tax cuts. That\u2019s what they say. A lot of them have sworn an oath to never raise taxes on anybody as long as they live. That doesn\u2019t square with their vote against these tax cuts. I mean, how is it that they can break their oath when it comes to raising your taxes, but not break their oath when it comes to raising taxes for wealthy people? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. (Applause.) I mean, I hope that they don\u2019t want to just score political points. I hope that they want to help the economy.\n\nThis cannot be about who wins and loses in Washington. This is about delivering a win for the American people. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) You know, $1,500 -- that\u2019s not a Band-Aid for middle-class families, that\u2019s a big deal. How many people here could use an extra $1,500? (Applause.) Yes, I thought so.\n\nSo I\u2019ll tell you what, Scranton. They may have voted \u201cno\u201d on these tax cuts once. But I\u2019m already filled with the Christmas spirit. There\u2019s kind of some chill in the air. I saw some Christmas decorations at the Festas. So I\u2019m in a Christmas spirit. I want to give them another chance. I want to give them a chance to redeem themselves. We\u2019re going to give them another chance.\n\nSo as early as Friday, this Friday, in a couple of days, we\u2019re going to give them a chance to take a simple vote on these tax cuts. If they vote \u201cno,\u201d then the typical family\u2019s taxes will go up by $1,000 next year. If they vote \u201cyes,\u201d then the typical family will have an extra $1,500 in their pocket. (Applause.) So let\u2019s just be clear: If they vote \u201cno,\u201d your taxes go up; vote \u201cyes,\u201d you get a tax cut. Which way do you think Congress should vote? They should vote \u201cyes,\u201d it\u2019s pretty simple.\n\n\n\nNow, if you want to see what this vote will mean for your bottom line, we have this spiffy new tax calculator on our Internet site, WhiteHouse.gov. So you can go on there and you can punch in your numbers and figure out what it would mean to your family. But this is real money that would go into the economy at a time it needs it.\n\nNow, I really do think your voices are already getting\n\nthrough, because some of the folks in Congress are starting to say, well, maybe we\u2019re open to this thing. Maybe we\u2019ll be open to these tax cuts. And that\u2019s good news. But I want to make sure that we do this responsibly. So what I\u2019ve said is, to pay for this tax cut, we need to ask wealthy Americans to pay their fair share. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re asking -- what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s ask the folks who\u2019ve seen their incomes rise fastest, who\u2019ve gotten bigger tax breaks under Bush, let\u2019s ask them to help out a little bit, because they made it better through the recession than most of us. Let\u2019s ask them to contribute a little bit more to get the economy going again.\n\nAnd I just want to point out I\u2019ve done pretty well over these last few years. So I\u2019ve said, let me pay a little bit more. I promise you, I can afford it. (Laughter.) I really can. We\u2019re asking people like me to sacrifice just a little bit so that you guys have a little bit of a leg up.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, let me say this: When you talk to most folks who are making a million dollars a year, they are willing to do more if they\u2019re asked. Warren Buffett is a good example. They\u2019re willing to do more if they\u2019re asked. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I mean, I don\u2019t want to exaggerate. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re volunteering. (Laughter.) But if they\u2019re asked, if they feel like it\u2019s going to help middle-class families, help grow the economy, help to reduce the deficit, they\u2019re willing to help. I can\u2019t tell you how many well-to-do folks I meet who say, look, America gave me a chance to succeed. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a good education. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a college scholarship. Somewhere along the line, somebody built the information and transportation networks that have helped my business grow. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a shot. And so now it\u2019s my turn to do the next generation that same good thing. I\u2019ve got to give something back to them as well. (Applause.)\n\nBecause, Scranton, this is something everybody in this audience understands. When you think about the history of Scranton and the immigrants who came here and worked hard, each successive generation doing a little bit better -- you guys know that what America is about is that we\u2019re all in this together; that each of us has to do our own individual part, but we also have to be looking out for one another.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the very simple choice that\u2019s facing Congress right now: Are you going to cut taxes for the middle class and those who are trying to get into the middle class? Or are you going to protect massive tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, many of whom don\u2019t even want those tax breaks? Are you going to ask a few hundred thousand people who have done very, very well to do their fair share? Or are you going to raise taxes for hundreds of millions of people across the country -- 160 million Americans? Are you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are most fortunate? What\u2019s it going to be?\n\nThat\u2019s the choice in front of Congress. And I hope members of Congress think hard about this, because their actions lately don\u2019t reflect who we are as a people. What does it say about our priorities when we\u2019d rather protect a few really well-to-do people than fight for the jobs of teachers and firefighters? (Applause.) What does it say when we -- about our values when we\u2019d rather fight for corporate tax breaks than put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools? (Applause.) What does it say about us if we\u2019re willing to cut taxes for the people who don\u2019t need them, and raise them on folks who do need a tax break?\n\nWe are better than that. America is better than that. We celebrate individual achievement, we expect everybody to work hard, but we don\u2019t believe in every person for themselves; we believe that out of many, we come together as one. (Applause.) We\u2019re a people who reach for our own success, but we also reach back for the people -- to bring somebody up. Reach back to help others earn their own success as well. (Applause.) And we believe that if the folks at the bottom and the folks in the middle succeed, then American succeeds, and the folks at the top succeed as well. (Applause.)\n\nThe decisions we make today are going to determine whether or not our kids grow up in a country where those values still thrive. And Scranton, I don\u2019t know about you, but I want our kids to grow up -- I want Malia and Sasha and all your kids, I want them to come into a country that is built on those big, generous values -- (applause) -- an America that reflects the values that we inherited from our parents and our grandparents.\n\nSo if you agree with me, I need you to tell Congress where your priorities lie. Members of Congress, they work for you. Scranton, you\u2019ve got a great senator in Senator Casey. I love Senator Casey. (Applause.)\n\nSo I want you to know, Casey is already on the program. (Applause.) But to everybody who is here, everybody who is watching, send your Senate a message -- send your senators a message. Tell them, \u201cDon\u2019t be a Grinch.\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cDon\u2019t be a Grinch.\u201d Don\u2019t vote to raise taxes on working Americans during the holidays. Make sure to renew unemployment insurance during the holidays. (Applause.) Stop saying \u201cno\u201d to steps that would make our economy stronger. Put our country before party. Put money back into the pockets of working Americans. Do your job. Pass this bill. (Applause.)\n\nScranton, the American people are with us on this. It is time for folks to stop running around spending all their time talking about what\u2019s wrong with America. Spend some time, roll up your sleeves, and help us rebuild America. That\u2019s what we need to do. (Applause.)\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this country that we can\u2019t fix. We\u2019re Americans, and our story has never been about things coming easy to us. That\u2019s not what Scranton has been about. That\u2019s not what Pennsylvania, that\u2019s not what America is about. It\u2019s been about rising to the moment, and meeting the moment when things are hard. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right.\n\nSo let\u2019s do what\u2019s right. Let\u2019s prove that the best days of America are still ahead of us.\n\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n3:03 P.M. EST",

    "text":"August 1, 2010 \u2014 -- AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me.\n\nPELOSI: My pleasure.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan.\n\nLast year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.\n\nPELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.\n\nOur president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.\n\nI persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.\n\nAMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.\n\nPELOSI: No.\n\nAMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.\n\nPELOSI: Right.\n\nAMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?\n\nPELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.\n\nAMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?\n\nPELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it?\n\nPELOSI: Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is it worth it?\n\nPELOSI: That's the question.\n\nAMANPOUR: But that's my question to you.\n\nPELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year.\n\nAMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you?\n\nPELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops\/\/\/and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely.\n\nSecondly, governance and ending corruption.....\n\nAMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, \"Time\" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban.\n\nYou know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again?\n\nPELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest.\n\nWhen I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women.\n\nAnd we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption.\n\nSo what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governance\n\nAMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forces\n\nBIDEN SOT---\"it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition\"\n\nDoes that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops?\n\nPELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel.\n\nHow does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.?\n\nPELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House?\n\nPELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will and\n\nAMANPOUR: No matter what happens?\n\nPELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority.\n\nYou had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen?\n\nPELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. And --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nfrom outsiders perspective....\n\nAMANPOUR: -- because many people are asking that --\n\nPELOSI: Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: ... how did you get to this place where, perhaps, you might lose your majority?\n\nPELOSI: We don't see it that way. We are very proud of the agenda that we have put forth to the American people. our recovery package, as the economists have said, we've had twice as many people unemployed as there are now if we had not moved forward. These actions are all controversial because we were digging our way out of a deep ditch.\n\nso we've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you nervous about November?\n\nPELOSI: No, I'm not nervous at all --\n\nAMANPOUR: Not at all?\n\nPELOSI: No. I'm -- I'm --\n\nAMANPOUR: Because people say I know you're putting on a great face --has you have to\n\nPELOSI: -- that's not.\n\nAMANPOUR: -- going into an election. But people say there's been considerable worry about what will happen in November.\n\nPELOSI: Well, let me say this. I never take anything for granted. And our agenda now is we're not going forward -- we're not going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration. We're going forward.\n\nAMANPOUR: So what does it make you feel, then, when the president's own spokesman said that you might lose the majority?\n\nPELOSI: Well, I -- you know, I --\n\nAMANPOUR: well how do you feel about it\n\nPELOSI: -- with all due respect -- I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another.\n\nAMANPOUR: But it directly impacts --\n\nPELOSI: Well, the -- they must realize that.\n\nBut you know what, I'm speaker of the House. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilize -- mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two to one advantage money-wise\n\nSo we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the tax cuts.\n\nAre you going to take that issue to -- to a fight before the elections, letting the tax cuts for the -- for the two -- 250,000 expire and then keep them on for the middle class?\n\nPELOSI: Well, the -- the tax cuts for the wealthiest -- of the $250,000 and above -- were the -- the Bush initiative. I dont see any reason why we should renew a tax cut that only gives a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America, increases the deficit and doesn't create jobs.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\nAMANPOUR: But I know that's your position, but\n\nPELOSI: Yes\n\nAMANPOUR: -- to the middle class --\n\nPELOSI: But to keep the middle class tax cuts--\n\nAMANPOUR: Would you take this to a vote before the election\n\nPELOSI: It would be my hope. But let me just say, on The Recovery Act, nearly $300 billion of The Recovery Act were tax cuts for the middle class. most people dont realize that\n\nThe Republicans want to have the tax cut and they want it unpaid for -- $700 billion added to the deficit for an initiative that does not create jobs.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I show you something?\n\nPELOSI: Sure.\n\nAMANPOUR: there's so much polarization, so much partisanship, so much -- not just amongst the politicians, but in the press, amongst the people. You talked a little bit about what, you know, us and them, in your view. I want to show you this, which is a Republican commercial.\n\nTV AD\/\/RIGHTCHANGE.COM (TAKE VIDEO CLIP FULL) AD NATS\n\nAMANPOUR: Oh, you haven't seen it?\n\nPELOSI: I have not seen that, but I have seen that in campaigns there is\n\nAMANPOUR: So what do you think --\n\nAMANPOUR: -- you being the -- the bogeyman?\n\nPELOSI: Well,-- what I know about that is that they tried this. This is their campaign in Pennsylvania 12, the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Their whole campaign was an attack on the president and on -- on Pelosi.\n\nAMANPOUR but it was you\n\nPELOSI: ...... and I said to to the president i think they may have gotten more focus here than you for this one time. And they fully expected to win the race and we won by 8.5 points. Because this is funny, it attracts attention, but they have nothing to say about what they want to go for, what they want to do is privatize Social Security. And as they have said, their agenda, if they win, is to go to the exact agenda of the previous administration and people will look with fondness on the Bush administration....we welcome that campaign\n\nAMANPOUR: -- for me, looking in from outside, it just seems -- that's seems to be a never-ending partisanship. What is it you can do for the people in this highly polarized situation.\n\nPELOSI well first of all, what you define as, you describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion. The Republicans are here for the special interests, we're here for the people's interests. The president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by America's working families. That is our priority. That is not their priority.\n\nThis isn't about inter-party bickering. This is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side you're on. You don't like to think that. We come here to find our common ground. That's our responsibility. But if we can't find it, we still have to move. I've never voted for a perfect bill in my life. I don't think anyone hasI wish it were not so stark. I wish the elections weren't so necessary for us to win. I really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground. Are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like? Well, we were digging out of a very deep hole. But we will continue to fight.\n\nAMANPOUR: Speaker Pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nPELOSI: Well, I look forward to welcoming you back soon again. And congratulations to you and much success.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to \"This Week\".\n\nGATES: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's start with WikiLeaks.\n\nHow can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to Lady Gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing?\n\nGATES: It's -- it's an -- it's an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the U.S., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it. But one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission.\n\nSo -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible. And so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in Afghanistan or Iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the U.S.\n\nAMANPOUR: So do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases?\n\nGATES: I think we have to look at it, although I must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that. I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have.\n\nAnd so we're going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information.\n\nAMANPOUR: How angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it?\n\nGATES: Well, I'm not sure anger is the right word. I just -- I think mortified, appalled. And -- and if -- if I'm angry, it is -- it is because I believe that this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk. It puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents. And so I think that's what puts our soldiers at risk.\n\nAnd -- and then, as I say, our sources. And, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct. And -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it.\n\nAMANPOUR: You know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a Taliban spokesman has told a British news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people.\n\nAre you worried?\n\nI mean Admiral Mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands?\n\nGATES: Well, I mean given the Taliban's statement, I think it -- it basically proves the point. And my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability. One is legal culpability. And that's up to the Justice Department and others. That's not my arena. But there's also a moral culpability. And that's where I think the verdict is guilty on WikiLeaks. They have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences.\n\nAMANPOUR: So let me ask you about a couple of things that came out. One is the possibility that the Taliban may have Stinger missiles.\n\nDo they, do you think?\n\nGATES: I don't think so.\n\nAMANPOUR: At all?\n\nGATES: I don't think so.\n\nAMANPOUR: The other is about Pakistan. Again raising the notion that Pakistan, no matter how much you say they're, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the Taliban and against al Qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in Pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the Taliban and what they're doing in Afghanistan.\n\nHow much of a problem is that for you?\n\nGATES: Well, it -- it is a concern, there's no question about it. But -- but I would say that, again, we walked out on Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag. And -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again. And I believe that's the reason there's a certain hedge.\n\nBut what I see is a change in the strategic calculus in Pakistan. As they see these groups attacking Pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in Northwestern Pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. But they're basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them. They haven't gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, Northern Waziristan. And General Jones, the national security adviser, has told \"The Washington Post\" that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate.\n\nSo unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in Afghanistan?\n\nGATES: Well, I think we can but --\n\nAMANPOUR: Even if the safe havens --\n\nGATES: -- but we clearly --\n\nAMANPOUR: -- exist?\n\nGATES: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens. But they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in South Waziristan and Swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed the Pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily.\n\nAnd so the Pakistanis going after any of these groups, I believe, overall, helps us in what we're trying to accomplish, both with respect to Afghanistan and with respect to al Qaeda.\n\nAMANPOUR: But given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the Taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the Pakistanis to -- to move on into Northern Waziristan?\n\nGATES: I think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the Pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border. We are increasing our forces in Eastern Afghanistan that will help us do this. So I think that -- I think we're moving in the right direction here.\n\nAMANPOUR: But you don't have an open-ended period of time. The president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition. And many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know.\n\nThe Taliban is clearly running out the clock -- it's trying to run out the clock.\n\nLet me put something up that David Kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to General Petraeus, said about the timetable.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDAVID KILCULLEN: They believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. And they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the Americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then. What are you doing on the 19th month? Who are you backing? Because we'll still be there and they won't be.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So that question is out there. So many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011.\n\nBut my question to you is this, what can General Petraeus do to defeat the Taliban at their own game?\n\nWhat can he do now in Afghanistan to avoid this deadline that they're setting for themselves?\n\nGATES: Well, first of all, I think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. We are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground. The president has been very clear about that. And if the Taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, I welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops. So I think that --\n\nAMANPOUR: But what is a lot of troops?\n\nGATES: Well, first of all, I think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers. And as we are successful, we'll probably accelerate. But, again, it's -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is there any way now -- between now and December, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that you're serious and to change the dynamic?GATES: Well, first of all, I think we're already seeing that. We're already seeing it in Central Helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning. We are seeing it in places like Nad Ali. We're actually seeing it in places like Marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but it's getting better every day. And we're seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around Kandahar.It's going to take some time. It's going to be tough. We're going to take casualties. We have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us. But I think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working.But the key thing to remember is the full surge isn't even all I Afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of August. So this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect. AMANPOUR: What I think a lot of people maybe don't get is that the Afghan people still want the American forces there. In the latest ABC poll, it shows that 68 percent of the Afghan people actually want the American forces still there.\n\nDo you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the American people more about -- about Afghanistan, about the strategy, about why it's important?\n\nGATES: Well, first of all, I'm here. And I think the president has been out and has spoken about this. He talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated General Petraeus, about where we were headed.\n\nProbably we can do more. But Secretary Clinton and I and the president and the vice president and General Jones have all been out and -- and talking about this. And -- and I think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that I find frustrating is that I think that the president's strategy is really quite clear. I hear -- I hear all the stories that say what's the strategy, what's the goal here?\n\nI think it's quite clear. It's to -- it's to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time we're building up the Afghan security forces, so that the Afghan security forces can deny the Taliban and al Qaeda a base from which to attack the United States and the West.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right.\n\nGATES: It's pretty straightforward.\n\nAMANPOUR: OK. Then let me -- since you brought that up, I want to bring up what Vice President Biden told NBC earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, I think the American people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now?\n\nLet me put that up.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in Afghanistan for one express purpose -- al Qaeda. The threat to the United States -- al Qaeda that exists in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not there to nation-build.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that it?\n\nGATES: That's good.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that the war?\n\nGATES: I agree with that. We are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in Afghanistan. What we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective.\n\nWe are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in Afghanistan.\n\nBut doing things to improve governance, to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the Afghan government in the security arena, that's what we're going to do.\n\nAMANPOUR: A final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the Taliban?\n\nGATES: I think that the -- I think that the way out is to improve the security situation in Afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government -- detaching themselves from al Qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the Afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons. I think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here. But it must take place on the terms of the Afghan government.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you think that can happen in -- in a year?\n\nGATES: Well, we're not limited to a year. I think that it can happen in the time frame that we're looking at ahead. Again, July 2011 is not the end. It is the beginning of a transition.\n\nAMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nGATES: Thanks a lot.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): Wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, has published 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak in history.\n\nGIBBS: There are names. There are operations. There's logistics. It poses a very real and potential threat.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I'm a combative person, so I wanted (inaudible)\n\nMULLEN: The truth is, they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Highlights from the Wikileaks story that's really shaken up Washington and capitals around the world. We'll talk about that and more on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, and in Madrid this morning, Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani journalist who is the world authority on the Taliban.\n\nThank you all for joining us this morning. Let me go to you first, George. What about this leak? How bad is it for the war effort? And how bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it does with state secrets?\n\nWILL: Well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in the sense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sources themselves. Not helping, in the sense that they're not a bit like the Pentagon Papers, which showed in the Vietnam War that the government internally had a very different understanding of what was going on in Vietnam than it was saying publicly.\n\nThat's not the case here. These are redundant anecdotes about what we all knew from good journalism and honest government about this.\n\nWhat we're left with now is still the question of the mission. In your interview with Secretary Gates, he said the following: \"We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan.\" Notice the preposition. We weren't attacked by Afghanistan, in the sense that we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor. We were attacked from there.\n\nAnd National Security Adviser James Jones has said that we have to be there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plot and train.\n\nAMANPOUR: Exactly.\n\nWILL: We were attacked from Hamburg, in a sense. You can plot in this kind of war anywhere.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, yes, but the real ground war is in Afghanistan.\n\nAnd let me go to Ahmed Rashid, who is the authority on the Taliban. Ahmed, what is your assessment of how Wikileaks and all the material and information that came out of that could affect the war?\n\nRASHID: Well, again, I don't think that there has been any really major new information given in these Wikileaks. The impact has been quite extraordinary in America, in Europe, and other places simply because this war has not really been properly followed by the public.\n\nThe media has not followed it. And as a result, I think people are being quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that have come out. But I don't think anything drastically new has come out. Now there is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the Taliban are going to follow up on.\n\nAMANPOUR: Precisely. And I wanted to ask you about that. You know already they have said that they're going to be searching and scouring this treasure trove. Do you -- do you foresee that there are going to be bodies turning up in Afghanistan amongst people who've really been helping the United States?\n\nRASHID: Well, I hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaks are quite old, and people have moved on. A lot of the names may be false names. I hope we're not going to see bodies, but certainly this is something -- the Taliban are extremely good at following debates in the West, the Western media, debates in parliaments in Europe, in the Congress. They will have seen this new vote just now, where so many of the Democrats seem to be voting against the war.\n\nThey are expert now at following up. And if there are people to be followed up upon, they will do so.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me put that to Donna Brazile and to Paul Krugman. The idea that they are really smart, they read the Western press, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to think that or not, media operation.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, it put the Afghanistan war back on the front page, the longest war in United States' history. Voters are weary of this war right now. Congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy.\n\nI think this will give the administration an opportunity to once again talk about the mission, before December, when the president has announced that he intends to reassess what they're doing.\n\nI also think it raises a serious question about Pakistan's involvement with the Taliban and also whether or not Mr. Karzai is still up to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing the police and the army. It raises a serious question about going forward and the timetable.\n\nKRUGMAN: You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, we can't abandon Afghanistan, all that. I'm surprised that people aren't pointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead.\n\nAnd now you're asking us to -- you're asking Obama to recover from a situation where we've spent eight years losing credibility.\n\nAMANPOUR: But the thing is, he is trying to recover. He's had this big strategy. He's made a surge in Afghanistan. And right now, for instance, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard has written a memo to President Obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011 deadline. What do you think has to happen to make this war winnable for the United States?\n\nWILL: Well, first of all, in his remarks to you, Secretary Gates semi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in July '11 -- 2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal. That's making it a fairly elastic deadline.\n\nBut look what -- and our friend in Madrid can comment on this. Secretary Gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government. Now, that, A, sounds like surrender, and, B, the normal Afghan would say, \"Give me a third choice, because I don't like the Afghan government, either.\"\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. Ahmed Rashid, how did you read that, that the Taliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on the terms of the Karzai government?\n\nRASHID: Well, I think this is going to be the very big debate that takes place within the Obama administration come December, when the policy review takes place, because the other position to this is that, in fact, the U.S. should start talks with the Taliban as soon as possible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try and bring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks.\n\nThe Taliban, with all their interlocutors that they've been talking to so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the Americans directly. Now, any such talks can't be based on conditions set by America, as Gates has just done. They would have to be free and open talks, and they would have to continue for some time.\n\nSo I think once you have a dialogue going with the Taliban, then you, I think, can go to the Pakistanis and the ISI and tell them, \"Now, look, we're talking to the Taliban. This is the end game now. The surges will continue. Talks will continue. But you now have to give a deadline for the end of these safe havens for the Taliban leaders.\"\n\nIn other words, the Taliban leaders should know that their safe havens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will also have a limited timeframe.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, lots and lots to talk about on this particular issue, but let's move on a little bit. I actually asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote in the House, and whether she thought that the president needed to come out and speak more to the country about Afghanistan. This is what she said to me. Listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPELOSI: They're worried about their economic security, and that's what they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase -- create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So there you have it. Economic security, obviously, is the number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there is these huge problems of unemployment. There is a huge debate right now, all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effect stimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy. Is it deficit reduction austerity? Is it more stimulus? Where do we go and what does it mean to people?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, what it means to people, I think, is a lot of confusion, which is -- which is a problem, right? They're not hearing any clear message.\n\nYou know, the way I look at it is that there are two sides in this debate -- I call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were -- one side, the inflationistas, have said, \"Oh, god, we have this -- we have budget deficits. The Fed is printing money. We're going to have inflation. Interest rates are going to go sky-high.\"\n\nThe deflationistas have said, you know, that we've had a major financial crisis. In the fact of that, the Obama stimulus plan is too small, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants to spend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation.\n\nSo far, the deflationistas have been totally right. What's interesting is that the political debate is being dominated by the people who've been wrong about everything up to this point, who said, well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower. They just hit a -- more than a year low just now.\n\nBut they keep on saying, oh, but it's any day now. We've got to be afraid of those people who aren't visible in the markets and so on.\n\nBut this is a -- there is this problem that people have got this austerity notion in their mind, not based on anything that's actually happening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because it appeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to make people suffer even more.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me put up this graphic, talking about the gross domestic product of the second quarter. Growth is happening, but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.\n\nYou're shaking your head.\n\nWILL: Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it. It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the stimulus is running out. Paul's right about this. Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone.\n\nSecond, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent.\n\nSo what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift.\n\nKRUGMAN: Exactly.\n\nWILL: It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I'm not the resident economist on the panel, clearly, but what's happening, Christiane, is that we're not creating jobs. The economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs. Unemployment remains high. The Democrats will have to campaign on the promise that the policies that they've put forward thus far has averted the Great Depression 2.0.\n\nAnd going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past, going back to Bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economic growth, which brings us back to the Bush tax cuts and -- and whether or not the -- the Congress will -- will just let them expire in January or let some of them stay on the table.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you heard what I asked Speaker Pelosi, and she said she hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before the midterms. Is that likely?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, look, Congress on the House side, they're away for six weeks. They're going out. They're going to campaign on what they've accomplished.\n\nBut I think when they return, they're going to have to turn back toward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince the voters out there that they've done something to provide economic growth for the future.\n\nKRUGMAN: Just wanted to say, George, it's exactly what I would have done in describing it. The forces for growth are fading out. We're not looking good going forward. This is very difficult. It's very hard for an administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, \"It could have been worse,\" and that is essentially -- and it's true. It actually could have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesn't sell very well.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I...\n\nWILL: Lest it be thought that Paul and I agree on something, let me...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you might. Maybe this is a rarity today.\n\nWILL: No, this is not the case, because Paul thinks the government is dangerously frugal at this point, and I do not think so. I side with people like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard who say there is time for austerity, and this is it.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, you know, we can...\n\nAMANPOUR: That's happening in Europe, as you know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: That's -- yes, I think Ken Rogoff is doing some damage here with some pretty bad statistics. But...\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I -- can I move over to Madrid again and ask Ahmed about this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts what's happening in -- in America's foreign policy, as well. What do people in Pakistan, who've been promised so much aid by the United States -- does this even figure in their debates when they look at the U.S., the fact that the money is shorter?\n\nRASHID: Oh, it does very much. I mean, I think really people are fully aware that the continuation of the American presence in Afghanistan and the aid to Pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if you like, to whether the American economy picks up or not, especially in the autumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will be completed, a very critical moment will appear when Obama has to decide what his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policy review.\n\nAnd all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effective or uneffective the American economy is doing. I mean, we've seen the vote in Congress now. I mean, what happens in three months' time if the vote in Congress is even more lopsided and more Democrats turn against the war?\n\nAMANPOUR: That is indeed a big question. Let us move on, though, right now -- and I want to move on to something else that the Democrats made a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have an ethical Congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many people said. This is what President Obama said just in the last couple of days over the travails of Representative Charlie Rangel.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 years old. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity, and my hope is, is that happens.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRAZILE: It would be politically expedient for Mr. Rangel to just step down and resign, but he's not the kind of lawmaker that would do that. These are serious allegations, and Mr. Rangel would like to have his day up on the Hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answer to some of these charges.\n\nAgain, it's easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of Drano, but it's clogged up, and I think Mr. Rangel and others would like to have their day to clear their names.\n\nAMANPOUR: What about the president making that pretty...\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, well, they...\n\nAMANPOUR: ... dismissive statement?\n\nKRUGMAN: No, I think it's fair enough. But, you know, let me ask -- there's something I don't understand about this whole thing. There are actually two major investigations of members of Congress underway right now. There's Charlie Rangel, who's accused of some fairly petty, although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and there's Senator John Ensign, who's facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- it's even a story that involves sex. And you get no publicity whatsoever on the Ensign investigation.\n\nWhy is Rangel getting all this attention?\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that fair, George?\n\nWILL: Well, Rangel is much more important, because he's chairman of an important committee. And in fact, Rangel's misfortune is a national misfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficit commission reports in December, we might have had -- serious tax reform in this country. That requires a cooperative member leading that committee in the House.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: Nothing's -- nothing's going to happen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKRUGMAN: If there's actually anything to come out of the deficit commission, it would matter, but it's not.\n\nWILL: ... as Rostenkowski was with Ronald Reagan's tax reform. Now, Rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strong position. His strong position is the president and everyone wants this thing over with so the Democrats won't be tarred with this, and therefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, a reprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here.\n\nKRUGMAN: In a way, he's sort of the Hamid Karzai of the U.S. Congress.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, I was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, but I was going to ask Ahmed Rashid what they make of all of this, given so much corruption charges over there. Ahmed, we're out of time, but thank you all so much for joining us.\n\nAnd the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks.

    "text":"Video: Hillary Clinton Outlines Economic Policy Plans\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, laying out her economic vision, said Monday that government must do more to rein in excessive risk taking on Wall Street, push financial firms to focus on long-term growth over short-term gains and assure stock markets \u201cwork for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders.\u201d She also touched on the so-called sharing economy and its promise and pitfalls. Here is a transcript of her remarks, provided by Federal News Service (www.fednews.com).\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, President Van Zant, and thanks to everyone at the New School for welcoming us today. I\u2019m delighted to be back.\n\nYou know, over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to listen to Americans\u2019 concerns about an economy that still isn\u2019t delivering for them. It\u2019s not delivering the way that it should. It still seems, to most Americans that I have spoken with, that it is stacked for those at the top.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also heard about the hopes that people have for their future \u2014 going to college without drowning in debt; starting that small business they\u2019ve always dreamed about; getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement.\n\nPrevious generations of Americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead. But over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again.\n\nFor 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. Yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans.\n\nTwice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI think the results speak for themselves. Under President Clinton \u2014 I like the sound of that \u2014 America saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future, and most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top. Eight years later, President Obama and the American people\u2019s hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression. President Obama saved the auto industry, imposed new rules on Wall Street and provided health care to 16 million Americans.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow today \u2014 today, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer- term challenges come into focus, I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. You can\u2019t have one without the other. We can\u2019t create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth, and we can\u2019t build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness. We need both.\n\nBecause while America standing again, we are not yet running the way we should. Corporate profits are at near record highs and Americans are working as hard as ever. But paychecks had nearly budged in real terms. Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets. Out of pocket costs of health care, child care, hearing for aging parents, are rising a lot faster than wages.\n\nI hear this everywhere I go. A single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids. She doesn\u2019t expect anything to come easy. But if she got a raise, everything would not be quite so hard.\n\nThe grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people\u2019s kids. She\u2019s proud of her work, but the pay is fairly enough to live on, especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs.\n\nThe young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt. If he can grow his business, he can pay off his debt and pay his employees, including himself, more, too.\n\nMillions of hardworking Americans tell similar stories. Wages need to rise to keep up with cost, paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead. The defining economic challenge of our time clear. We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans, so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive steady income growth that lifts up families, and lifts up our country. And that\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will get up every day thinking about the families of America, like the family I came from, with a hard-working dad who started a small business and scrimped, and saved, and gave us a good middle- class life. I will be thinking about all the people that I represented in New York and the stories that they told me, and that I worked with them to improve. I will, as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the Recession and will not end with the recovery.\n\nYou know, advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often they are polarizing our economy, benefiting high skilled workers, but displacing and downgrading blue-collar jobs and other mid-level jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of Americans.\n\nToday\u2019s marketplace focuses too much on the short-term, like second to second financial trading, and quarterly earnings reports, and too little on long-term investments. Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation.\n\nBut it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.\n\nSo, all of these trends are real and none, none is going away. But they do not determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter. And the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what American life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century.\n\nAs president, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us, to strengthen, not hollow out, the American middle class. Because I think at our best, that\u2019s what Americans do. We are problem solvers, not deniers. We don\u2019t hide from change; we harness it.\n\nThe measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, not just for successful CEOs and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful. We\u2019re not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we can\u2019t go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes.\n\nToday is not 1993. It\u2019s not 2009. So we need solutions for the big challenges we face now.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking Americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth.\n\nLet me begin with strong growth. More growth means more jobs and more new businesses. More jobs give people choices about where to work.\n\nAnd employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones. That\u2019s why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes.\n\nSmall businesses create more than 60 percent of new American jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. I\u2019ve said I want to be the small-business president, and I mean it. And throughout this campaign, I\u2019m going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification.\n\nI\u2019ll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in America, closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I know it\u2019s not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want you to hear this. Bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThen there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs, create the next generation of high-paying jobs.\n\nYou know, when we get Americans moving, we get our country moving. So let\u2019s establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2026 channel those funds to finance world-class airports, railways, roads, bridges and ports.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd let\u2019s built those faster broadband networks and make sure there\u2019s a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur economy obviously runs on energy, and the time has come to make America the clean-energy superpower. I advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs, save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change.\n\nAnd let\u2019s fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries, just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and President Obama\u2019s initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years.\n\nI will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.\n\nBut today, let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: breaking down barriers so more Americans participate more fully in the workforce, especially women.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe are in a global competition, as I\u2019m sure you have noticed. And we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. But that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing today. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.\n\nThe movement of women into the American workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But that progress has stalled.\n\nThe United States used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women\u2019s labor force participation. By 2013, we had dropped to 19th. That represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for American families.\n\nStudies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they\u2019re expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not.\n\nWe should be making it easier for Americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. Women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they\u2019re going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick.\n\nYou know, last year \u2013\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2013 last year while I was at the hospital here in Manhattan, waiting for little Charlotte to make her grand entrance, one of the nurses said, thank you for fighting for paid leave. And we began to talk about it. She sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of.\n\nIt\u2019s time to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury. It\u2019s a growth strategy. And it\u2019s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou know, all this lost money adds up. And for some women, it\u2019s thousands of dollars every year. Now I am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women\u2019s issues. Well, those days are over.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days, childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth. And we can do this in a way that doesn\u2019t impose unfair burdens on businesses, especially small businesses. As president, I\u2019ll fight to put families first, just like I have my entire career.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow beyond strong growth, we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes. The evidence is in. Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. So this is the problem we need to tackle. Now, you may have heard Governor Bush say Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met very many American workers.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLet him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay. They do not need a lecture. They need a raise.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work, like financial trading, for example much more than other work, like actually building and selling things, the work that has always been the backbone of our economy. To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be a fairly. So, we do have to raise the minimum wage, and implement President Obama\u2019s new rules on overtime, and then we have to go further.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis- classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages. To make paychecks stretch, we need to take on the major strains on family budgets. I will protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd to make prescription drugs more affordable. We will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing Social Security and making it easier to save for the future. Now, many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle scarred. We need new ideas, as well, and one I believe in and will fight for is profit-sharing. Hard-working Americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce.\n\nSo, I will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That is good for workers and good businesses. Studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company\u2019s success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees\u2019 pockets. It\u2019s a win-win. Later this week in New Hampshire, I will have more to say about how we do this.\n\nAnother priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Senator Rubio\u2019s would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.\n\nWell, that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy, and that\u2019s the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side. I have a different take\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2026 guided license principles. First, hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification. Second, those at the top have to pay their fair share. That\u2019s why I support the Buffet Rule, which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries. I have called for closing the carried interest loophole, that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate.\n\nAnd let\u2019s agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that America has to offer, should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share, especially while companies who can\u2019t afford high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Alongside tax reform, it\u2019s time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers\u2019 rights, and practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as president. I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. Evidence \u2013\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2013 evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men, so if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd let me just say a word here about trade. The Greek crisis as well as the Chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy. Trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades, but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities.\n\nSo we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don\u2019t. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.\n\nI love the saying by Abraham Lincoln who, in many ways, was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities. He talked about giving Americans a fair chance in the race of life. I believe that with all my heart, but I also believe it has to start really early, at birth.\n\nHigh quality early learning, especially in the first five years, can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent. And \u2013\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2013 and I\u2019m committed to seeing every 4-year-old in America have access to high quality pre-school in the next 10 years. But I want to do more. I want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community, our business community, our academic institutions, from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens, to really help parents, particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles, to really help prepare their own children in that 0 to 4 age group.\n\nEighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of 3. That\u2019s why families like mine read, talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter. I\u2019ve said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut we do it not only because we love doing it, even though, I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s embarrassing, you know, reading a book to a two-week-old or a six-week-old or a 10-week-old, but we do it because we understand it\u2019s building her capacity for learning. And the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten, she will have heard 30 million more words than a child from a less advantaged background.\n\nThink of what we are losing because we\u2019re not doing everything we can to reach out to those families, and we know, again, from so much research here in the United States and around the world that that early help, that mentoring, that intervention to help those often stressed-out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start.\n\nWe also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level, and in the coming weeks and months, I will lay out specific steps to improve our schools, make college truly affordable and help Americans refinance their student debt.\n\nAnd let\u2019s embrace \u2013\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2013 let\u2019s embrace the idea of lifelong learning. In an age of technological change, we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs.\n\nThere are exciting efforts underway and I want to support and scale the ones that show results.\n\nAs we pursue all these policies, we cant forget our fellow Americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to Indian country.\n\nTalent is universal; you find it everywhere. But opportunity is not. There are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in America today who are not in school or at work. The numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering.\n\nA quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all Latino youth cannot find a job. We\u2019ve got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class.\n\nI firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that\u2019s hard to say if there aren\u2019t enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas. When \u2013\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2013 when all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard and share in our country\u2019s prosperity, that\u2019s fair growth. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always believed in and it\u2019s what I will fight for as president.\n\nNow the third key driver of income, alongside strong growth and fair growth, must be long-term growth. Too many pressures in our economy push us toward short-termism. Many business leaders see this. They\u2019ve talked to me about it.\n\nOne has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism. They say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital and talent.\n\nNet business investment, which includes things like factories, machines and research labs, have declined as a share of the economy.\n\nIn recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. That doesn\u2019t leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company\u2019s future success.\n\nThese trends need to change. And I believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities, not just to today\u2019s share price but also to workers, communities and ultimately to our country and, indeed, our planet.\n\nNow I\u2019m not talking about charity; I\u2019m talking about clear-eyed capitalism. Many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity, better service and larger profits.\n\nNow it\u2019s easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but I would argue that\u2019s bad for business in the long run and it\u2019s really bad for our country.\n\nWorkers are assets. Investing in them pays off; higher wages pay off. Training pays off. To help more companies do that, I proposed a $1,500 tax credit for every worker they train and hire. And I will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs, more than just quick trades.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will also propose reforms to help CEOs and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMaking sure stock buybacks aren\u2019t being used only for an immediate boost in share prices; empowering outside investors who want to build companies, but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders. And nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on Wall Street.\n\nAs a former senator from New York, I know firsthand the role that Wall Street can and should play in our economy, helping main street grow and prosper, and boosting new companies that make America more competitive globally.\n\nBut as we all know in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either could not or would not keep up. I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.\n\nUnder President Obama\u2019s leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on Wall Street. Those rules have been under assault by Republicans in Congress and those running for president. I will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made. We can do that, and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust.\n\nWe also have to go beyond Dodd-Frank. Too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky. And the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines. Serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system, including hedge funds, high-frequency traders, non- bank finance companies. So many new kinds of entities, which receive little oversight at all.\n\nStories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking. HSBC allowing drug cartels to launder money, five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates. There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains. This is wrong, and on my watch it will change. Over the course\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\u2026 over the course of this campaign, I will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections. I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem. We will ensure\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee. And we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public, it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public. It could, for example, help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers.\n\nNow, reform is never easy, but we\u2019ve done it before in our country, and we have to get it right this time. And yes, we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us.\n\nTwo years ago, the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Terry Duffy, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that really caught my attention.\n\nHe wrote, and I quote, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it. Some Wall Streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the Main Street,\u201d unquote.\n\nI think we should listen to Terry Duffy. Of course, long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well.\n\nSo it\u2019s time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. It\u2019s time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we\u2019re going to tackle the big stuff together.\n\nHow do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys? Can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing? What are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors, like Silicon Valley?\n\nQuestions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government, from our leaders in the private sector, our economists, our academics, others who can come together to the table and on behalf of America perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo government has to be smarter, simpler, more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics and be a better partner to cities, states and the private sector. Washington has to be a better steward of America\u2019s tax dollars and Americans\u2019 trust. And please, let\u2019s get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as president. I will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together, and I will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable, including by continuing to restrain health care costs, which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits.\n\nI will make sure Washington learns from how well local governments, businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across America.\n\nYou know, passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress. As president, I will use the power to convene, connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done, because above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI confess, maybe it\u2019s the grandmother in me, but I believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you\u2019ll never sit, and the vision I\u2019ve laid out here today for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth all working together will get incomes rising again, will help working families get ahead and stay ahead. That is the test of our time.\n\nAnd I\u2019m inviting everyone to please join me to do your part. That\u2019s what great countries do. That\u2019s what our country always has done. We rise to challenges. It\u2019s not about left, right or center; it\u2019s about the future versus the past.\n\nI\u2019m running for president to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday, an America built on growth and fairness, an America where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, where we don\u2019t leave anyone behind.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you all. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one more thought. I want every child, not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state, but every child to be able to reach for her God-given potential. Please join me in that mission \u2014 let\u2019s do it together.\n\nThank you all so much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

    "text":"Speaking in Cleveland, Ohio, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for unity in the wake of the tragic shooting in Orlando. Here are key moments from that speech. (Video: Reuters\/Associated Press)\n\nGift Article Share\n\nHillary Clinton delivered an address pledging that as president she would take on \"lone wolves\" who might carry out terrorist attacks in the United States and calling for unity in light of the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday. The compete transcript of her remarks in Cleveland are posted below.\n\nSPEAKER: FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. Thank you all.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. Thank you. I am -- I'm absolutely -- I'm absolutely delighted to be back in Cleveland and to be here at the Industrial Innovation Center. I've had a chance to learn about the great work you do here. I especially want to applaud Team Wendy for everything you do to protect our troops, first responders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd others from traumatic brain injury. It is so important that we continue to support those who protect us.\n\nAUDIENCE: We want Hillary!\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE: We want Hillary!\n\nCLINTON: Thank you all.\n\nAUDIENCE: We want Hillary!\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: It is good to be back in Cleveland, I can tell you that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want to thank -- I wan to thank your extraordinary senator, Sherrod Brown, for his leadership, for that very kind and generous introduction. You are very fortunate to -- to have him representing you. I want to thank your congresswoman, Marcia Fudge...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWho is both indomitable and indefatigable. She is such a tenacious advocate for the people she represents. I want to acknowledge the mayor, Mayor Jackson, who was here, County Executive Budish (ph). And I particularly want to recognize the passing of George Voinovich, and he devoted his life to serving the people of Ohio as mayor of Cleveland, as governor and senator. And we send our prayers and sympathy to his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also want to thank Dan Moore, the owner and founder of this company and Team Wendy for his belief in Cleveland, for his commitment to create jobs. I can't wait to work with him to do more of what he has accomplished here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou know, originally, I had intended to come to Cleveland under very different circumstances. We are heading into a general election that could be the most consequential of our lifetimes. But today is not a day for politics.\n\nOn Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare that's become mind numbingly familiar. Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected. A madman filled with hate, with guns in his hands, and just a horrible sense of vengeance and vindictiveness in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americans, and by extension, the openness and diversity that defines our American way of life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will learn more about the killer in the days to come. We know that he pledged allegiance to ISIS, that they are now taking credit and that part of their strategy is to radicalize individuals and encourage attacks against the United States, even if they are not coordinated with ISIS leadership. But there's a lot we still don't know, including what other mix of motives drove him to kill.\n\nThe more we learn about what happened, the better we'll be able to protect our people going forward. In the days ahead, we will also learn more about the many lives he viciously cut short, many of them young people, just starting out in their lives. They were travel agents and pharmacy techs, college students and amusement park workers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and they had one thing in common. They all had a lot more to give.\n\nCLINTON: We should take a moment today amid our busy lives to think about them, to pray for everyone who was killed, for the wounded, those who are fighting to regain their lives and futures, for our first responders who walked into danger one more time. As a mother, I can't imagine what those families are going through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let's also remember the other scenes we saw on Sunday. We saw the faces of some of those first responders who rushed into danger and tried to save as many people as they could. We saw survivors like Chris Hansen who risked their lives to help others.\n\nPeople gathering outside hospitals to comfort anxious family members, waiting for news of their loved ones and waiting, too, to learn more about what they could do to make sure this never happened again.\n\nReligion leaders condemning hate and appealing for peace. People lining up to donate blood. Americans refusing to be intimidated or divided.\n\nYesterday I called Mayor Dyer of Orlando and offered my support and my appreciation for the leadership that he and the other officials have shown. This is a moment when all Americans need to stand together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many times we endure attacks like this, the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security and makes us furious.\n\nNow we have to steal our resolve to respond. And that's what I want to talk to you about. How we respond.\n\nThe Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI have no doubt -- I have no doubt we can meet this challenge if we meet it together. Whatever we learn about this killer, his motives in the days ahead, we know already the barbarity that we face from radical jihadists is profound.\n\nIn the Middle East, ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. They are slaughtering Muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways. They are beheading civilians, including executing LGBT people. They are murdering Americans and Europeans, enslaving, torturing and raping women and girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn speeches like this one, after Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, I have laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and the other radical jihadist groups in the region and beyond.\n\nThe attack in Orlando makes it even more clear, we cannot contain this threat. We must defeat it. And the good news is that the coalition effort in Syria and Iraq has made recent gains in the last months.\n\nSo we should keep the pressure on ramping up the air campaign, accelerating support for our friends fighting to take and hold ground and pushing our partners in the region to do even more.\n\nWe also need continued American leadership to help resolve the political conflicts that fuel ISIS recruitment efforts.\n\nBut as ISIS loses actual ground in Iraq and Syria, it will seek to stage more attacks and gain stronger footholds wherever it can, from Afghanistan, to Libya, to Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe threat is metastasizing. We saw this in Paris. And we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.\n\nCLINTON: So, yes, efforts to defeat ISIS on the battlefield must succeed. But it will take more than that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have to be just as adaptable and versatile as our enemies. As president, I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will put a team together from across our government, the entire government, as well as the private sector and communities to get on top of this urgent challenge. And I will make sure our law enforcement and intelligence professionals have all the resources they need to get the job done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we do this, there are three areas that demand attention. First, we and our allies must work hand-in-hand to dismantle the networks that move money, and propaganda, and arms and fighters around the world.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have to flow -- we have to stem the flow of jihadists from Europe and Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and then back again. The only way to do this is by working closely with our partners, strengthening our alliances, not weakening them or walking away from them.\n\nSecond, here at home, we must harden our own defenses. We have to do more to support our first responders, law enforcement and intelligence officers who do incredible work every day at great personal risk to keep our country safe.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI have seen firsthand how hard their job is, and how well they do it.\n\nIn Orlando, at least one police officer was shot in the head. Thankfully, his life was saved by a Kevlar helmet, something folks here at Team Wendy know a lot about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt has often been said that our law enforcement, our intelligence agencies, our first responders have to be right 100 percent of the time, but terrorists only have to be right once.\n\nWhat a heavy responsibility. These men and women deserve both our respect and gratitude. And they deserve the right tools, and resources and training. Too often, state and local officials can't get access to intelligence from the federal government that would help them do their jobs.\n\nWe need to change that. We also need to work...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe also need to work with local law enforcement and business owners on ways to protect vulnerable, so-called soft targets, like nightclubs and shopping malls and hotels and movie theaters and schools and houses of worship.\n\nNow, I know a lot of Americans are asking how it was possible that someone already on the FBI's radar could have still been able to commit an attack like the one in Orlando, and what more we can do to stop this kind of thing from happening again.\n\nWell, we have to see what the investigation uncovers. If there are things that can and should be done to improve our ability to prevent, we must do them. We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out.\n\nThat's why I have proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board with appropriate safeguards here at home.\n\nEven as we make sure our security officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attack.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: And that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI believe weapons of war have no place on our streets and we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things.\n\nIf the FBI is watching you for a suspected terrorist link, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.\n\nAnd you shouldn't be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show.\n\nAnd yes, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.\n\nNow, I know some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism. Well, in Orlando and San Bernardino terrorists used assault weapons, the AR-15. And they used it to kill Americans. That was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook.\n\nWe have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war. And that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack, but it will stop some and it will save lives and it will protect our first responders.\n\nAnd I want you to know, I'm not going to stop fighting for these kinds of provisions.\n\nNow, the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by ISIS and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the United States and Europe.\n\nFor starters, it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism.\n\nWe also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online. This is something that I spend a lot of time on at the State Department.\n\nAs president, I will work with our great tech companies from Silicon Valley to Boston to step up our game. We have to a better job intercepting ISIS' communications, tracking and analyzing social media posts and mapping jihadist networks, as well as promoting credible voices who can provide alternatives to radicalization.\n\nAnd there is more to do offline as well.\n\nCLINTON: Since 9\/11, law enforcement agencies have worked hard to build relationships with Muslim American communities. Millions of peace-loving Muslims live, work and raise their families across America. And they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, and the best positioned to help us block it. So we should be intensifying contacts in those communities, not scapegoating or isolating them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLast year, I visited a pilot program in Minneapolis that helps parents, teachers, imams, mental health professionals and others recognize signs of radicalization in young people and work with law enforcement to intervene before it's too late.\n\nI've also met with local leaders pursuing innovative approaches in Los Angeles and other places. And we need more efforts like that in more cities across America. And as the director of the FBI has pointed out, we should avoid eroding trust in that community, which will only make law enforcement's job more difficult.\n\nInflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow Americans because of their religion. It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. That's wrong. And it's also dangerous. It plays right into the terrorists' hands.\n\nStill, as I have said before, none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use their distorted version of Islam to justify slaughtering $ innocent people. They'd take us all back to the Stone Age if they could, just as they have in parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. And an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country. You have millions of allies who will always have your back.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I am one of them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFrom Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.\n\nOur open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability. It makes us stronger and more resistant to radicalization. And this raises a larger point about the future of our country.\n\nAmerica is strongest when we all believe that we have a stake in our country and our future.\n\nCLINTON: This vision has sustained us from the beginning. The belief that, yes, we are all created equal and the journey we have made to turn that into reality over the course of our history, that we are not a land of winners and losers, that we should all have the opportunity to live up to our God-given potential. And we have a responsibility to help others do so as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs I look at American history, I see that this has always been a country of \"we\" not \"me.\" We stand together because we are stronger together. E pluribus unum. One -- out of many, one -- has seen us through the darkest chapters of our history. Ever since 13 squabbling colonies put aside their disagreements and united because they realized they were going to rise together or fall separately, generation after generation has fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of dignity and opportunity. Ending slavery. Securing and expanding the right to vote. Throwing open the doors of education. Building the greatest middle class the world has ever seen.\n\nAnd we are stronger when more people can participate in our democracy.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we are stronger when everyone can share in the rewards of our economy and contribute to our communities, when we bridge our divides and lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. Now we have overcome a lot together and we will overcome the threats of terror and radicalization and all of our other challenges. Here in Ohio and across America, I've listened to people talk about the problems that keep you up at night.\n\nThe bonds that hold us together as communities, as one national community, are strained by an economy with too much inequality and too little upward mobility. By social and political divisions that have diminished our trust in each other and our confidence in our shared future. I have heard that, and I want you to know as your president I will work every day to break down all the barriers holding you back and keeping us apart. We're gonna get an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, we're gonna forge a new sense of connection and shared responsibility to each other and our nation.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n(APPLAUSE) finally let me remind us all, I remember, I remember how it felt, on the day after 9\/11, and I bet many of you do as well. Americans from all walks of life rallied together with a sense of common purpose on September the 12th and in the days and weeks and months that followed. We had each others' backs. I was a senator from New York. There was a Republican president, a Republican governor, and a Republican mayor. We did not attack each other. We worked with each other to protect our country and to rebuild our city (ph).\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPresident Bush went to a Muslim community center just six days after the attacks to send a message of unity and solidarity. To anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our Muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, \"That should not, and that will not, stand in America.\" It is time to get back to the spirit of those days, spirit of 9\/12. Let's make sure we keep looking to the best of our country, to the best within each of us. Democratic and Republican presidents have risen to the occasion in the face of tragedy. That is what we are called to do my friends and I am so confident and optimistic that is exactly what we will do.\n\nThank you all so much.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "text":"U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop.\n\n\n\nThe Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and \"fight to rein in the EPA.\" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements.\n\n\n\nIn a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter \"Crying over spilt milk.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do spilt milk and oil have in common?\" he wrote. \"Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA\u2019s reasoning is that milk contains \u2018a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.\u2019 It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.\"\n\n\n\nWith visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim.\n\n\n\nBeth Breeding, Griffith\u2019s press secretary, said her boss\u2019s information came from the EPA\u2019s website. So we went there.\n\n\n\nRight away, we found problems with Griffith\u2019s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a \"new ruling,\" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years.\n\n\n\nThe EPA site says \"since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of \u2018oil\u2019 from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.\"\n\n\n\nThe website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk.\n\n\n\nSo what\u2019s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month.\n\n\n\nThe simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here\u2019s what the regulation says:\n\n\n\n\"EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,\" or similar state laws.\n\n\n\nTranslated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA\u2019s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell \"raw,\" or unpasteurized, milk, so the state\u2019s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards.\n\n\n\nRaw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk.\n\n\n\nBaffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s review our findings.\n\n\n\nGriffith claimed a \"new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply\" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies.\n\n\n\nIn fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The \"new ruling\" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims.\n\n\n\nSure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right.\n\n\n\nGriffith is dishing udder cow chips. We rate his statement False.",

    "text":"Gift Article Share\n\n\u201cFACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.\u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says \u201cevery voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump\u201d is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump\u2019s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because Trump himself hasn\u2019t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn\u2019t respond to our request for more information, and doesn\u2019t seem to have answered other media outlets\u2019 requests, either.\n\nPerhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he\u2019s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.\n\nThe Facts\n\nCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)\n\nAfter the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.\n\nThat year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.\n\nThe one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: \u201cI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There\u2019s no more gun-free zones.\u201d His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.\n\nOur colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal \u201craises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?\u201d\n\nTrump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s answer was still devoid of specifics:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I\u2019m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it\u2019s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, \u2018This is incredible. This is perfect. There\u2019s no guns in there. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s going to have guns.\u2019 You can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I\u2019m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I\u2019m allowed to do that. . . . But we can\u2019t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, \u2018We are a gun-free zone.\u2019 And then you have these crazy people out there saying, \u2018Boy, this is the most incredible thing,\u2019 and that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren\u2019t clear yet.\n\nTrump said he would \u201cwork with the states\u201d but that he would \u201coverride the states if I have to.\u201d Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.\n\nThe Geppetto Checkmark\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

(Applause.) Well, hello, Michigan! (Applause.) Happy New Year to everybody.\n\nAUDIENCE: Happy New Year!\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I -- what was that? I love you back. (Laughter.)\n\nI want to thank all the outstanding leaders that we\u2019ve got here today. I want to introduce some of them. We\u2019ve got Secretary of Labor Tom Perez here. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan here. (Applause.) Senator Gary Peters is in the house. (Applause.) Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here. (Applause.) Your outstanding CEO, Mark Fields, is here. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I have to say I love the Secret Service, I love the Beasts that they put me in and -- that\u2019s what we call the cars I drive in, \u201cthe Beasts.\u201d So I like my ride these days. And it was made in Michigan, too. (Applause.) But I just had a chance to look at these new Mustangs, and I\u2019ve got to say that the Mustangs have a little more style, a little more flavor. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nBill Ford is in the house. (Applause.) Surprisingly enough, we talked a little bit about Sunday. (Laughter.) Now, listen, I\u2019m a Bears fan. You beat us twice. But even a Bears fan has to admit --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We got hosed!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- that that was a little suspect. (Applause.) I have never seen anything like that before. I would have been pretty irritated. Were you irritated? Oh, yes. (Laughter.) But all I can say -- because I\u2019m used to saying this, I\u2019m a Bears fan -- there\u2019s always next year. (Laughter.) And look, you\u2019ve got a lot to be hopeful for. First of all, you\u2019ve got one of the best defenses in the league. (Applause.) A fine young quarterback, Megatron. And if there\u2019s one thing that you can take to the bank when talking about Detroit is that Detroit always comes back. (Applause.) Detroit always comes back. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today. One of my New Year\u2019s resolutions is to make sure that more Americans in Wayne, more Americans in Michigan, more Americans all across this great country -- that everybody feels like they\u2019re coming back. And there is no doubt, thanks to the steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation, we are entering into the New Year with new confidence that America is coming back. (Applause.)\n\nNow, you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. The facts are the facts. And let\u2019s face it, a lot of times the media doesn\u2019t like reporting on good news, but every once in a while, it\u2019s important for us to hear some good news, not to make us complacent, but to give us confidence that if we work harder, we can make even more good news.\n\nSo here\u2019s how we begin this year. Last year, 2014, was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. (Applause.) Since the 1990s. (Applause.) We\u2019ve now had a 57-month streak of private sector job creation. We\u2019ve created nearly 11 million new jobs. That\u2019s the longest stretch in our history of private sector, uninterrupted job creation. (Applause.)\n\nHere\u2019s another way of thinking about it. Since 2010, we, America, have put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. (Applause.) Combined. (Applause.) And let me tell you what\u2019s leading the way: American manufacturing. After a decade of decline, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s. Here in Michigan, manufacturers have created more than 100,000 jobs, helping to cut your unemployment rate in half.\n\nSo we\u2019re making more stuff. We\u2019re selling it around the world. America is the number-one producer of oil, the number-one producer of gas. It\u2019s helping to save drivers about a buck-ten a gallon at the pump over this time last year. (Applause.) And the cars that you make help everybody go a little further on that gallon of gas. (Applause.)\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- (applause) -- about 10 million Americans gained health insurance just over this last year. We\u2019ve cut our deficits by about two-thirds. I\u2019d like people to think about that, because when they do surveys of, like, ordinary folks on the street and they ask them, are the deficits going up or are they coming down, everybody automatically assumes, well, government spending and deficits must be going up. Deficits have come down by two-thirds since I took office -- by two-thirds. They\u2019re going down. (Applause.) And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, which means more of our brave troops have come home and spent time with their families during the holidays. (Applause.)\n\nSo the point is we\u2019re moving. These six years have been tough, demanded hard work, demanded sacrifice on everybody\u2019s part. You guys know that more than most. Which means that as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we\u2019ve got to show for all that hard work.\n\nAmerica\u2019s resurgence is real. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you otherwise. We\u2019ve got the best cards and we are doing better than just about anybody else on Earth. And now that we\u2019ve got some calmer waters, now that the worst of the crisis is behind us, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, then we can make sure that this rising tide is actually lifting all the boats, not just some. We can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers American prosperity for decades to come.\n\nAnd that\u2019s going to be the focus of my State of the Union address in a couple of weeks -- building on the progress that we\u2019ve already made. But I\u2019ve got to admit I\u2019ve only got two years left in office -- I didn\u2019t want to wait for the State of the Union to talk about all the things that make this country great and how we can make it better. So I thought I\u2019d get started this week. (Applause.) I figured, why wait? It\u2019s like opening your Christmas presents a little early.\n\nSo today I\u2019m here in Detroit, going to talk about the incredible things that have happened in the auto industry and what more we can do with manufacturing. Tomorrow, I\u2019m going to visit Arizona, a state that was hit about as hard as anybody by the housing crisis, because we want to talk about how we're making homeownership a reality for more middle-class families.\n\nOn Friday, I\u2019m going to go to Tennessee, a state that's making big strides in education, to show how we can help every American get the education they need to get ahead in this new economy.\n\nBut today, I wanted to come here to Michigan because this state proves no matter how tough times get Americans are tougher. (Applause.) Plus I wanted to see the new Mustang. (Laughter.)\n\nNow, let\u2019s just take a minute and think about what you've had to fight through. A few years ago, nearly one in five autoworkers got a punch in the gut with a pink slip. The year before I took office, 400,000 jobs vanished in this industry -- 400,000. Sales plunged 40 percent. And then as the financial crisis built, we faced what once seemed unimaginable when just two of the Big Three -- GM and Chrysler -- were on the brink of failure.\n\nNow, this is the heartbeat of American manufacturing right here. And it was flat-lining. And we had a choice to make. We could have kept giving billions of taxpayer dollars to the auto industry without asking for accountability or change in return. But that would have just kicked the problem down the road. We could have done nothing, which some people said we should do, and let those companies fail. But think about what that would have meant for this country. The suppliers, the distributors, the communities that depend on the workers who patronize the restaurants and shop at the stores, all those companies would have gone under also.\n\nAnd, look, the fact is nobody was in a stronger position than Ford. Bill and the team had done a great job steering Ford through tough times, but Bill and others are the first to admit that you could have had a cascading effect if the whole supply chain in the U.S. auto industry starts declining. Then Ford could have gone under, too. Plants would have shuttered. We would have lost this iconic industry, sold for scraps. And folks like you -- the men and women who built these companies with your hands -- would have been hung out to dry. And the communities you depended on -- the schoolteachers, the small business owners, the servers in the diner and, let\u2019s face it, the barkeep -- (laughter and applause.) I\u2019m just saying. (Laughter.) Are you a barkeep, or you\u2019re just waving at me? (Laughter.) But everybody would have been affected. Their jobs were at stake, too.\n\nAnd it\u2019s more than that. The jobs in the auto industry have always been about more than a paycheck. They're a source of pride for generations. It was representative of what it meant to get into the middle class. You work hard in this job, you could afford to raise a family, buy a house, go on vacation, retire with some dignity. You knew you were making something that people could count on. It meant something. Every car you sent off the line brought you that step closer to doing the right thing by your family and giving something to your kids, and having a sense of security in your life. So plants like this one built more than just cars -- they built the middle class in this country. And that was worth fighting for. (Applause.)\n\nSo in exchange for the help, we demanded responsibility. We said to the auto industry, you\u2019ve got to change with the times. Plants retooled. Plants restructured. Labor and management worked together, settled their differences. Everybody put some skin in the game. Everybody made some sacrifices. It wasn\u2019t just some, it wasn\u2019t just the workers who gave something up -- everybody.\n\nAnd that's how things work best, by the way, when everybody is in it -- when workers and businesses work together; when whoever is in the board room and folks on the floor, they both understand they\u2019re in it together. And we believe America is best when everybody is in it together. And we rejected the false choice that either unions or businesses could succeed but not both. We said, you know what, what\u2019s going to work for the company is also going to work for that worker, and vice versa, which means when the company is doing better, then the workers have got to get their share as well. (Applause.)\n\nAnd Ford rejected the false choice that they could either take care of their shareholder or take care of their worker -- they did both. And the company benefited and America benefited. We believed in shared sacrifice and that shared sacrifice leads to shared prosperity.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I was talking to the Detroit News -- they were asking, what was it like when you were making this decision? I just want everybody to be clear. It was not popular. Even in Michigan, it wasn\u2019t popular. I remember they did a poll and, like, in Michigan, it was like only 10 percent were in favor. (Laughter.) And you don\u2019t have to be a genius political analyst to say, 10 percent is not very high. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd, look -- and it wasn\u2019t on my to-do list when I ran for President. I wasn\u2019t expecting to have to do this. But I ran not to be just doing the popular things, I ran not just to do the easy things, I ran to do the right thing. And saving the American auto industry was the right thing to do. (Applause.) Betting on you was the right thing to do. (Applause.) It was the right thing to do. And that bet has paid off for America, because the American auto industry is back. (Applause.)\n\nNow, part of the reason that we wanted to start this trip here is not just because I wanted to see the new Mustang, not just because the American auto industry is back, but because last month we actually marked a milestone. Last month, the rescue of the auto industry officially came to an end. The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in you. (Applause.) You paid the taxpayers back with your hard work, with your dedication. (Applause.)\n\nAnd over the past five years, this industry created about 500,000 new jobs. Last year, American autoworkers churned out cars faster than any year since 2005. Ford has brought jobs back from Mexico, created nearly 24,000 new jobs across this country, including 1,800 new jobs right here in this plant. (Applause.) And after more than a century since Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, you\u2019re reinventing it -- one production line for gas, electric, hybrid, plug-in vehicles. That\u2019s the first in the world, right here in Wayne, Michigan. (Applause.) First in the world. (Applause.) That\u2019s always cool when you do something first.\n\nAnd you\u2019re helping rebuild the middle class for the 21st century. Just down the road in Lincoln Park, UAW-Ford Joint Apprenticeship Program is providing workers with hands-on training in the skills that employers need for the jobs of tomorrow. And nationally, by the way, 87 percent of all apprentices are employed after they complete their apprenticeship program, with an average starting wage of $50,000. So the more folks we get into apprenticeships, the more folks are getting middle-class jobs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I called on last year for businesses across the country to create more and expand more apprenticeship programs. And since then, we\u2019ve seen the largest increase in apprenticeships in nearly a decade. And now my administration is investing $100 million in an American Apprenticeship Grant competition. We\u2019re going to build on this momentum. We\u2019re going to expand successful programs. We want young people to see that they have opportunities. They don\u2019t all have to go to a four-year college. They can get an apprenticeship, save some money, start working -- (applause) -- build a family, buy a home, get some Lions tickets. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nBecause everybody came together here and worked together, folks are better off. And some of the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, high-powered, heart-pounding, good-looking, well-designed, fuel-efficient cars in the world are once again designed, engineered, forged and built not in Europe, not in Asia, right here in the United States of America. (Applause.) Right here in America. (Applause.)\n\nSo because of you -- because of you, manufacturing has a future in this country. Management has actually grown faster than other parts of the economy. And companies are now saying, you know what, we got to get back to America. We got to relocate. We were offshore, and now they're saying, oh, oh, America is back. We better get back in there. And that means because of you, the middle class has a future in this country.\n\nAnd the auto industry has proved that any comeback is possible -- and by the way, so has Motor City. (Applause.) So has a Motor City. (Applause.) A year and a half ago, Detroit became the largest city ever to file for bankruptcy. Today, under the leadership of Mayor Duggan, Detroit is charting a new course. Businesses and private investors are making big investments, including Ford, which is helping to launch a tech startup incubator downtown. New restaurants and stores are popping up. Residents are fighting blight, securing abandoned homes, cleaning up neglected neighborhoods.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing stories of young people who left town for other opportunities, didn't think they could make it here, and suddenly they're saying, you know what, maybe I want to get back to Detroit -- hoping to be part of the rebirth of this city.\n\nNow, this city still faces big challenges, but you\u2019re coming back. Just like the auto industry is going to have to continue to come up with new ideas and new designs and address competition. It never stops. We got to stay hungry. We can't be complacent. Just like America has got to still keep on working. Just like the Lions got to still come up with a little more work. (Applause.) But we're coming back.\n\nAnd one thing is for sure -- we may not all root for the Lions, but America is rooting for Detroit. (Applause.) America is rooting for Detroit. (Applause.) We want the Motor City strong. And behind the stories of plants and cities and economic data, it\u2019s people. It\u2019s all of you.\n\nSo I\u2019ll just close with a story of a guy named Ramone -- because we\u2019re rooting for guys like Ramone. Ramone spent eight years in the military, served in Afghanistan, served in Iraq. Ramone here? Raise your hand, Ramone. (Applause.)\n\nSo Ramone is somebody who fought for our freedom, fought for our security. But sometimes we give lip service to supporting our troops, and then when they come home they get lost. So when Ramone came home, he had a hard time finding a job because it was a tough economy. He didn\u2019t want to be a burden on his family, so he moved into a homeless shelter, took whatever work he could get. And then, one day in 2012, a VA counselor that he\u2019d been working with handed him an application from Ford. Ford was hiring for new shifts.\n\nImagine what Ramone felt the day he knocked on his grandpa\u2019s door -- his grandfather who had spent 25 years building Mustangs in Dearborn -- and Ramone was able to tell his grandfather he got a job at Ford. (Applause.) And now Ramone has got his own place. And now Ramone has got a good job right on the line here in Wayne. And every day, he\u2019s doing just what his grandfather did. And he\u2019s proud. He\u2019s punching in and building some of the best cars in the world. (Applause.)\n\nIf you want to know what America is about, about grit and determination and hard work and sacrifice and looking out for one another and not giving up, think about Ramone. Think about Detroit. Think about the auto industry. Think about the Midwest. Think about Michigan. Think about America.\n\nWhen our assembly lines grind to a halt, we work together, we get them going again. We don\u2019t give up. We get up, we fight back. We come back stronger than before. Thanks to the hard work of people like you, America is coming back. And I\u2019m going to be on your side every step of the way. (Applause.)\n\nThank you, Michigan. God bless you. God bless America.

    "text":"CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have estimated the direct spending and revenue effects of H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, as passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2012. H.R. 6079 would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the exception of one subsection that has no budgetary effect. This estimate reflects the spending and revenue projections in CBO\u2019s March 2012 baseline as adjusted to take into account the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the ACA.\n\nFor various reasons discussed in the report, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting H.R. 6079 are close to, but not equivalent to, an estimate of the budgetary effects of the ACA with the signs reversed.\n\nWhat Is the Impact of Repealing the ACA on the Federal Budget?\n\nAssuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013\u20132022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.\n\nWhat Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits?\n\nDeficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions:\n\nThe ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of those coverage expansions\u2014which include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges, increased outlays for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employers\u2014will be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and net savings from other coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of the ACA, over the 2013\u20132022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross savings of an estimated $1,677 billion and net savings (after accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion.\n\nThe ACA also includes a number of other provisions related to health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion.\n\nThe ACA includes a number of provisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to net investment income for high- income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain manufacturers and insurers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 2013\u20132022 period.\n\nWhat Would be the Effect of Repealing the ACA on Discretionary Spending?\n\nIn addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBO\u2019s estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number of authorizations for appropriations, which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations.\n\nWhy Are These Estimates Uncertain?\n\nProjections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nation\u2019s health care and health insurance systems requires estimates of a broad array of technical, behavioral, and economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent Supreme Court decision that essentially made the expansion of the Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates. However, CBO and JCT, in consultation with outside experts, have devoted a great deal of care and effort to the analysis of health care legislation in the past few years, and the agencies have strived to develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes.",

    "text":"It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call \u2018fake news\u2019 today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? \u2018Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o\u2019er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth\u2019s fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President.

We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.\n\nRADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\n\nAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.\n\nI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\n\nIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\n\nI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\n\nTRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\n\nWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.\n\nYou say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.\n\nBut I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\n\nYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\n\nAnd they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.\n\nYes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\n\nCOOPER: So, Mr. Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\n\nCOOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\n\nTRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\n\nCOOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.\n\nCOOPER: Have you ever done those things?\n\nTRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.\n\nWe\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\n\nDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\n\nSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\n\nSo this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\n\nCLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.\n\nRADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\n\nI\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.\n\nShe\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\n\nTRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?\n\nRADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.\n\nTRUMP: Sounds fair.\n\nRADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.\n\nTRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.\n\nIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\n\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\n\nAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.\n\nWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\n\nCLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\n\nHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d\n\nHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\n\nNumber two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\n\nSo, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\n\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.\n\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: In the first debate\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.\n\nSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nI take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.\n\nTRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nShe said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.\n\nAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\n\nOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move on.\n\nTRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\n\nRADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.\n\nTRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.\n\nCLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond, please.\n\nCLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.\n\nCLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.\n\nCLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.\n\nTRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.\n\nCLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\n\nTRUMP: Get off this question.\n\nCLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.\n\nCOOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We brought up the e-mails.\n\nTRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.\n\nCOOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\n\nCOOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\n\nCLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.\n\nTRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\n\nBut everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\n\nNumber three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before.\n\nSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.\n\nRight now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.\n\nIt\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.\n\nObamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\n\nWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.\n\nYou will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.\n\nBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, your time\u2026\n\nTRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\n\nCLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.\n\nAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\n\nThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare\u2026\n\nTRUMP: By the way\u2026\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans\u2026\n\nCOOPER: What does that mean?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\n\nTRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.\n\nAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\n\nAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\n\nAnd, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nAnd she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\n\nI want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\n\nCLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.\n\nIt\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\n\nWe are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.\n\nThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..\n\nRADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026 TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.\n\nRADDATZ: I do.\n\nTRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?\n\nRADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\n\nWe have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\n\nBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?\n\nSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: So, please\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That has not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\n\nTRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.\n\nRADDATZ: She did not.\n\nTRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?\n\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, please.\n\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.\n\nAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.\n\nICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, two, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\n\nBut, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.

And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nCLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 with the Russians and other foreign powers.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.\n\nBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.\n\nBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.\n\nI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\n\nNow, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.\n\nI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nCOOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.\n\nShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\n\nBut \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.\n\nWe\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\n\nBut we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\n\nAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\n\nCLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\n\nAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\n\nI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.\n\nWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.\n\nPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nCLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\n\nTRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.\n\nCOOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?\n\nTRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.\n\nSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.\n\nBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.\n\nCOOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\n\nTRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.\n\nHey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.\n\nCOOPER: In the past\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.\n\nTRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nTRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.\n\nCLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.\n\nEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9\/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\n\nI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nCLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.\n\nTRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.\n\nBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\n\nSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\n\nRussia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\n\nI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which\u2026\n\nCLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point\u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were\u2026\n\nCLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\n\nTRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\n\nObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\n\nNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\n\nNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.\n\nLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\n\nBut look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: And one thing I have to say.\n\nRADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\n\nTRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\n\nRADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?\n\nTRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\n\nI believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\n\nWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country?\n\nRADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.\n\nTRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.\n\nRADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.\n\nTRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\n\nNow, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\n\nCLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.\n\nI do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Everything.\n\nCLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\n\nI would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.\n\nI would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.\n\nRADDATZ: You had many answers.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.\n\nCOOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?\n\nQUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\n\nCOOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\n\nBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.\n\nTRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.\n\nSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.\n\nLet me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\n\nMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\n\nAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\n\nYou know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\n\nSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\n\nCOOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up.\n\nCLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?\n\nCLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\n\nAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you.\n\nCLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.\n\nCOOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.\n\nTRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.\n\nWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\n\nCOOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.\n\nTRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\n\nCOOPER: You mentioned sex tape.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens\u2026\n\nCOOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.\n\nNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9\/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.\n\nAnd I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move along.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to\u2026\n\nCLINTON: Five million homes were lost.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.\n\nCLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another\u2026 TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.\n\nTRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?\n\nRADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.\n\nBecause I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.\n\nI would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\n\nNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\n\nI want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\n\nSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.\n\nI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.\n\nBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.\n\nNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.\n\nSo I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.\n\nI ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?\n\nIt\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.\n\nCLINTON: Well\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.\n\nCLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\n\nCOOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?\n\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\n\nWe are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.\n\nAnd you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.\n\nI will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.\n\nYou take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.\n\nThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\n\nYou know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\n\nSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\n\nCOOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We have\u2026\n\nCOOPER: One more audience question.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\n\nSo I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.\n\nI will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.\n\nCOOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.\n\nRADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.",

Our headliners this morning, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.\n\nHOYER: We need to get it stopped.\n\nTAPPER: And Minority Leader John Boehner.\n\nBOEHNER: Figure out what the hell went wrong.\n\nTAPPER: Hoyer and Boehner, a \"This Week\" debate.\n\nThen, he revolutionized computing, and now he wants to do the same for energy. In a \"This Week\" exclusive, Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates outlines his vision for a clean energy future...\n\nGATES: The government playing a strong role is critical and urgent.\n\nTAPPER: ... and what it will cost.\n\nPlus, the roundtable looks at a big night for women in politics. That and all the week's politics with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, former Republican Congressman Tom Davis, and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\n\nAnd as always, the Sunday funnies.\n\nCOLBERT: Eighty-two billion dollars lost. God. It would be such a tragedy if any pelicans owned BP stock.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: From the heart of the nation's capital, \"This Week\" with ABC's senior White House correspondent, Jake Tapper, live from the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nTAPPER: And joining me now is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Minority Leader John Boehner. Gentlemen, thanks so much for joining me.\n\nHOYER: Thank you.\n\nBOEHNER: Hey, good morning.\n\nTAPPER: So you got a letter last night -- I actually think I got it before you guys did...\n\nHOYER: I think you did.\n\nTAPPER: ... but from President Obama requesting $50 billion in emergency spending for state and local governments. Leader Hoyer, you have said that there is spending fatigue on Capitol Hill. Can you get this passed?\n\nHOYER: Well, I think it's accurate that there's spending fatigue, not only on Capitol Hill, but around the country. People are concerned about the debt level, and we are, as well. But clearly, you cannot not continue to stimulate an economy that is still struggling to get out of the deep ditch that we found it in about 18 months ago.\n\nWhat the president is saying is, we need to expend additional dollars to make sure that we don't have significant layoffs in the next few months, which will again depress the economy, so that -- I understand what he's saying. I have asked the White House to look at the package that we -- the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we passed, approximately $800-plus billion. There are clearly funds in there that have not been expended to see whether or not there are some available for this more immediate priority than some that may not be quite as immediate.\n\nTAPPER: Leader Boehner, the president said in his letter that if this does not pass, the economy -- there's a risk that the economy will slide back into recession. Do you agree?\n\nBOEHNER: Listen, I'm concerned about the plight of teachers, firemen, policemen who face the real possibility that they may be laid off, but to send this letter up here on a Saturday night with no opportunity to cut spending elsewhere in the budget strikes me as a little different. Steny and I and other leaders were at the White House on Thursday, and this subject never came up.\n\nThere was no indication this was going to happen. And I'm asking myself, why is this happening on Saturday night?\n\nFact is that the spending spree in Washington is continuing to run unabated. The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs, \"Stop!\" And -- and to move this without finding other offsets in spending, I think, is irresponsible. It's just putting more debt on the backs of our kids and our grandkids, and it really begs the question is, why don't we have a budget this year?\n\nYou know, we've not cut -- the House has failed -- not failed in the modern era to move a budget. And this appears to be the first time in the modern era that the House is not even going to consider a budget.\n\nTAPPER: Well, Leader Hoyer, if I could...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: ... if I could say, one of the -- the theory is that you don't want to make vulnerable Democrats vote for another spending bill, and that's why for the first time since 1974 there isn't going to be a House budget. Is that not true?\n\nHOYER: Whatever -- whatever the theory may be, Jake, the fact of the matter is, my friend, Mr. Boehner, voted for $2 trillion during the Bush administration of unfunded spending. So when he says this cascade of spending, he...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: But you agree that this should be offset with spending cuts?\n\nHOYER: I would hope that we could do that, yes. However, what I said was, money that has already been appropriated in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that has not yet been spent could be spent now on these priority items. Nobody wants to see $300,000 teachers or fire and police laid off. That's not good for the economy; it's not good for our kids; it's not good for the safety of our communities.\n\nSo the president's absolutely right in terms of this being critically important spending, and we're going to work on getting that. I personally believe that if we have dollars that are not yet expended in the Recovery Act that we can apply to this immediate need and then look to later expenditures in the long term for investments, I think we ought to do that. But we can't -- we can't stimulate and depress at the same time.\n\nTAPPER: I'd like to -- I'd...\n\nBOEHNER: Jake, every family knows that in a tough time it's more important to have a budget, not less. And if you think that they're going to move a budget on Capitol Hill, you must obviously believe that Elvis is still alive.\n\nTAPPER: Well, I'd -- I'd like to move on to another topic...\n\nHOYER: I know you do...\n\nTAPPER: ... other than Elvis.\n\nHOYER: ... but as you know, the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06.\n\nBOEHNER: The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.\n\nHOYER: And the American public had no idea about that, budgets that pass...\n\nBOEHNER: Well, this is a great opportunity...\n\nHOYER: ... and spending bills that follow (ph).\n\nBOEHNER: ... to cut spending and to get the economy going again.\n\nHOYER: And we're doing that.\n\nBOEHNER: That's why I gave the president...\n\nHOYER: Let me close with this.\n\nBOEHNER: ... a letter this week with -- 100 economists signed a letter saying that cutting spending now will, in fact, help get the economy moving again, get jobs back...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: I would like -- in terms of getting things moving again, I would like to move to another topic...\n\nHOYER: Look, can I conclude on the deficit? Because the president -- we've adopted statutory PAYGO, which they jettisoned.\n\nBOEHNER: And you've ignored it every time you've had a chance to use it.\n\nTAPPER: All right, guys...\n\nHOYER: The president sent down a freeze in spending. And he established a commission to look at long-term spending control. All of that is positive movement.\n\nTAPPER: Let's move on to the oil spill.\n\nBOEHNER: The American people want spending cut now.\n\nTAPPER: Got it. Let's move on to the oil spill, because I want to get your reaction. On Tuesday, the BP chief operating officer, Doug Suttles, told the Associated Press that the flow \"should decrease to a relative trickle by Monday or Tuesday.\" That's by tomorrow or the day after that, Doug Suttles said that.\n\nI don't know what a relative anything means when it comes to this oil spill, but there's no indication that there's going to be -- it's only going to be trickling by tomorrow or the next day. And I just want to know, as the leaders of your respective parties on Capitol Hill, are you finding it tough to believe anything these guys from BP have to say anymore?\n\nHOYER: Certainly BP has not been accurate in its representations. It has been misleading in its representations. What has happened is outrageous, and the American public are correctly very, very angry. And the administration has been marshalling every asset that we have available to work on this program.\n\nI hope he's right. The American public hopes he's right. A trickle. I don't know what a trickle is. But certainly a very, very substantial reduction. BP said they could handle a 250,000-barrel spill. They have -- weren't able to handle what they said was initially a 5,000, which was -- what then went to 20,000 or 25,000 and now we think is a much greater spill than that.\n\nBOEHNER: Well, Steny, guess what? I agree wholeheartedly with you. The American people want this oil leak stopped now. They want to know what happened. They want the gulf cleaned up. And they want it all done now.\n\nAnd I just think that BP ought to be held responsible for all of the costs that are involved in this. I've said that right from -- from the beginning. And I continue to believe that.\n\nI'm sure that the federal government, though, was -- isn't also responsible. The laws that were in place, the -- the materials that should have been in place for a spill this size were not, and the reaction, I think, on the part of the administration has been slow. But having said that, it's time to get this thing stopped now.\n\nTAPPER: All right, just to...\n\nHOYER: The only thing I would say to that, Jake...\n\nTAPPER: ... just to clear up what you said earlier this week, on Thursday, you said that -- that BP and the federal government should take full responsibility. To clarify that, you think BP needs to pay?\n\nBOEHNER: I've said from the beginning, BP needs to pay for the entire cost of this. But the federal government -- this is a failure of government. Government is there to protect our shores, to protect our environment. And there's been a real failure here.\n\nWe've been asking for 55 days, where's the inspection reports from this rig? The administration won't give them to us.\n\nTAPPER: The Democrats are pushing a bill to lift the liability. Right now, it's at $75 million. Democrats are pushing a bill to lift the liability cap. Do you support that?\n\nBOEHNER: I believe that lifting the liability cap on BP and for this spill is appropriate. I have concerns...\n\nTAPPER: So lift it entirely for BP?\n\nBOEHNER: Absolutely. They should be held responsible for every dime of this cost.\n\nHOYER: Let me -- let me -- let me say a few words here. First of all, the Republicans have been holding up lifting the cap in the Senate from the $75 million, minuscule sum, as we see, to $10 billion.\n\nSecondly, I think John Boehner is right in this respect: The psychology of neglect in terms of regulatory oversight that was pursued in the Bush administration, which led to the banking failure, insurance prices going way up, and oil companies thinking they could do whatever they wanted because the \"drill, baby, drill\" crowd, all they wanted them to do was to drill.\n\nSo I think John's right. I think the regularly psychology of the last administration was not appropriate, and there was mistakes made in this administration, as well.\n\nBOEHNER: How long are you going to blame the Bush administration? Come on. What's going on over at MSS...\n\nHOYER: As long as they're responsible, whether it's the economy...\n\nBOEHNER: No, that's -- listen...\n\nHOYER: ... or their lack of oversight, John, I'm going to do that.\n\nBOEHNER: Where -- where -- when is someone...\n\nHOYER: As appropriate (ph).\n\nBOEHNER: ... in Washington going to -- Washington going to take responsibility for what they are in charge of?\n\nTAPPER: I want to move on...\n\nHOYER: And the administration has done that.\n\nTAPPER: I want to move on to some foreign policy questions, but before I do, I just -- there -- there was a poll recently this week indicating that the American people rate the federal response to this oil spill as worse than the federal response to Katrina, 69 percent negative for the gulf oil spill, 62 percent negative for the government's response to Katrina. Do you rate the government's response to this oil spill as negative or positive?\n\nHOYER: Absolutely not. I think that that's -- the American public are angry, rightfully so. BP was on site. The folks who own the rig, Halliburton, who constructed the piping, the concrete down there, they are responsible with the federal government was (ph).\n\nImmediately upon this incident happening -- immediately...\n\nTAPPER: So you think the government's responsible?\n\nHOYER: ... the Coast Guard -- the Coast Guard was on site. Unfortunately, tragically, we lost 11 lives, but saved over 100 lives on site. Thad Allen, the admiral, immediately put in charge, 17,500 National Guard troops on duty right now.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nHOYER: So there's been a vast response here. A natural disaster came along in Katrina, and, frankly, there were months before there was adequate response.\n\nTAPPER: Leader Boehner, turning to Israel, a member of your leadership team, Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana, said this on Thursday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPENCE: Remarkably, yesterday, the president said it was time for Israel to sharply limit its effective blockade in Gaza, saying, quote, \"The situation in Gaza is unsustainable.\" The truth is, Mr. President, your policy in Israel is unsustainable. The American people are on the side of Israel and Israel's right to defend herself. Mr. President, whose side are you on?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Leader Boehner, is expressing concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza the same thing as being anti-Israel?\n\nBOEHNER: Well, I think the Israelis have a clear right to -- to defend themselves. When you look at this flotilla that came over, the first five ships that were inspected, there was no -- there was no problem at all. It's pretty clear to many of us who've looked into this that this last ship was intended to be a problem, intended to cause a conflict.\n\nAnd this is part of a much bigger problem that we see with the administration, where we've -- we've coddled our enemies and -- and pushed our friends aside in the process...\n\nTAPPER: Leader Hoyer?\n\nBOEHNER: ... raising a lot of doubts around the world, including the people of Israel, who are having serious doubts about our commitment to them, our closest ally in the Middle East.\n\nHOYER: And I think one of the problems is, when you see Mr. Pence and you hear Mr. Boehner, this is not a partisan difference. Mr. Cantor and I had a colloquy on Thursday, which as John knows, I strongly support Israel's actions.\n\nThey told these folks, come here, you're not going to break the blockade. Why are you not going to break the blockade? Because Hamas, a terrorist organization, continues to attack civilians, men, women and children, in Israel.\n\nAnd it is appropriate to have a blockade to make sure they don't get the weapons or other materials to effect those kinds of attacks, which are criminal, which are terrorist acts. So I think they did exactly the right thing in stopping that.\n\nAnd in fact, in my view, the sixth ship, as John has pointed out, we agree on this, five ships were stopped without incident. This sixth ship was stopped. There's some reason to believe that that's exactly what they intended to do. Al Jazeera television showed attacks on the boarding party, and they responded in self-defense.\n\nTurkey knew that if these ships came, it was going to be a problem. And the Israelis offered to allow the -- those ships to be offloaded at an Israeli port and all the humanitarian gear go into Gaza. That was the appropriate thing to do.\n\nTAPPER: We only have one minute left, and I want to get your predictions for the midterm elections, literally one minute left. So...\n\nHOYER: History says we're going to lose a few seats, but we're going to retain the House.\n\nTAPPER: You're going to keep the House?\n\nHOYER: We're going to keep the House.\n\nTAPPER: Sir?\n\nBOEHNER: Our goal is to take the majority in the House...\n\nTAPPER: Not your goal. What's going to happen? Prediction. Prediction. You've said 100 seats. Can you do it?\n\nBOEHNER: We've got -- we've got 100 seats in play. We have a real shot at winning a majority so that we can put a check on this administration and all the spending that's out of control here in Washington, D.C.\n\nHOYER: Jake, they said that about Mark Critz in the 12th District of Pennsylvania. He won by 8 points.\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\nHOYER: We're going to keep the House.\n\nTAPPER: Leader Hoyer, Leader Boehner, thanks so much for joining us. I appreciate it.\n\nTAPPER: Joining me now, Microsoft co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates.\n\nMr. Gates, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nBILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER & CHAIRMAN: Great to be here.\n\nTAPPER: Obviously, the oil spill in the Gulf makes your proposal for $11 billion in energy innovation all the more resonant, all the more relevant. But I'm wondering, some are criticizing the president's handling of the federal response to the spill by saying he doesn't have executive experience and that's why he hasn't been able to -- to really get the federal bureaucracy moving the way it needs to.\n\nAs a former CEO, do you think there's anything to that at all?\n\nGATES: Well, I think in any crisis like this, the key thing is to avoid them happening in the future. And I'm not an expert on oil recovery. BP is certainly incented to try and minimize the damage here in a very complex situation.\n\nBut how did we get an ener -- energy infrastructure that is this fragile?\n\nYou know, we've got a supply chain where we send a billion dollars a year overseas and you can imagine that there will be disruptions. When there have been in the past, we've always said, no, let's put a solution in place. But, in fact, the only real solution is to take American ingenuity and fund R &D to get energy in different forms that we're not sending this much money away and -- and that it's stable and reliable.\n\nTAPPER: Well, let -- let's talk about that. Obviously, your proposal for $11 billion in additional spending for energy innovation, there's not a huge appetite right now among the American people for more spending with the record deficits we have.\n\nForgetting the merits of your proposal for a second, how politically feasible is it?\n\nGATES: Well, I would distinguish between spending and investment. What we're talking about is about 1 percent of what the United States spends on energy, being devoted to R &D. And so if you find a way out of the energy sector to raise that 1 percent, which is not some huge increase in the costs there, then you can tap into the unique ability in this country, through its universities, the national labs and entrepreneurs, to give us a form of energy that is both cheaper, not dependent on foreign supply and is environmentally designed so that we're not emitting carbon and getting into the climate change problem.\n\nThe only way you get those things is through the breakthroughs. And I'm optimistic they're there, but we're not making the investment. Today we spend only about $4 billion on energy R &D compared to $30 billion on health, $80 billion on -- on defense.\n\nTAPPER: So that's your pitch.\n\nHow receptive have you found lawmakers?\n\nGATES: Well, there is obviously a -- a tight budget. And it would be tough to say that this money should come from existing categories.\n\nThe question is can the energy sector finance its own revolution and create these great R &D jobs here in America?\n\nTAPPER: What's the risk if -- if President Obama and Congress and the American people don't do this?\n\nGATES: The problem we'll run into is that we'll have more crises like the oil spill and we'll have the supply disruption. We'll start to see more and more effects of the -- the climate problem. The costs will go up because you're looking for oil in harder and harder places.\n\nSo you'll just be paying more and more. And so it's an implicit tax. If you don't innovate, it's this gigantic cost that we'll be paying.\n\nTAPPER: You know, some experts believe that the only way to spur the kind of innovation and investment in these alternative forms of energy is to dissuade the American people and American enterprise from using oil and gasoline. Do you think that a gas tax is necessary?\n\nGATES: The -- that's not specifically necessary. You need some source of funding for this R &D. And, you know, so you would take some parts of the energy sector and -- and raise the money there.If you -- if you want people to switch, there's two ways to do it. One is to invent something that's lower cost. The other is to raise the cost of the thing that's forcing us to fund the military or creating climate problems and -- and help the new technology. The bulk of what's missing right now that will force us, at some point, to go for a very expensive alternative because we haven't done invention, is the -- this -- this R &D piece isn't getting done.\n\nTAPPER: Why do you think that the innovation and technology that's part of the oil industry hasn't advanced enough in the last 30 years, I mean to -- to plug this hole in the Gulf, they're using basically the same technology as they used 20 or 30 years ago?\n\nWhy have -- hasn't that advanced?\n\nGATES: Well, certainly, in retrospect, they needed to invest more in these deep sea operations. Deep sea operation is fairly complicated in terms of pressures and temperatures how materials behave down there. And obviously, you know, now they're seeing the cost of not doing that. That will be reinforced in a lot of ways.\n\nSo that particular innovation will happen. But you're going to get oil in very hard places. With other energy sources, over time, you wouldn't have to try that hard you wouldn't have to be bringing most of it out of the Middle East, where, you know, the chance of something disrupting that in the years ahead is -- is very measurable and -- and we're not -- we're not setting ourselves up to get rid of that over time.\n\nTAPPER: So tell us what areas you're looking at.\n\nGATES: Well, the idea of the Council's report is that you -- you fund R &D very broadly with an open mind. You don't just pick and say it will be synthetic fuels or hydrogen or fuel cells, but you get behind all of those things and you create metrics. In the solar area alone, there's so many different approaches -- solar thermal, solar chemical, solar electric -- and many different scientists. And that's the beauty of America, is you -- you can have hundreds of teams pursuing those things. And as they meet milestones, they can get more funding.\n\nTAPPER: The economic recovery has been slow and relatively jobless.\n\nWhat do you think President Obama needs to do?\n\nGATES: Well, the president can't just pull the levers and -- and make the economy take off. You know, the right emergency steps were taken and...\n\nTAPPER: So you support the stimulus and the TARP program?\n\nGATES: Well, you don't -- I don't think I need to get into the particulars. And it's easy looking back to say, OK, you could have tuned this or that. The incredible measures needed to be taken to make sure there wasn't a collapse, both in terms of stabilizing the financial system and then priming the pump of the economy, because it had been slowed down so much.\n\nNow, we're seeing the benefits that those things have been done. Now this is an international problem.\n\nAnd so everybody's dad is coming in, you know, are -- are those governments over spending?\n\nYou know, our own government is looking at when do you cut back?\n\nAnd it's a tricky thing, because almost everybody agrees we need to keep spending up, you know, not take all country deficits to zero right away. But over time, you have to move in that direction. And so getting the timing right on this is -- is a very tough challenge.\n\nTAPPER: So do you think that there needs to be another stimulus to keep spending up?\n\nGATES: In terms of the U.S. in particular, lots of people, you know, have views that plus and minus on that in terms of if you did a -- a smaller stimulus, where exactly would you target?\n\nYou know, our $16 billion for energy R &D, that's a type of stimulus. That is creating jobs and it's a -- a nice investment in the future. So where you get a twofer like that, that feels particularly attractive that -- that you can do that.\n\nTAPPER: Do you think the health care legislation is going to do enough to contain costs and control the deficit?\n\nGATES: Well, the -- the health care bill broadened coverage. And there's a lot of...\n\nTAPPER: Yeah, but beyond that, do you think it's going to contain...\n\nGATES: Well, in terms of cost containment, that step alone, in my view, is at most the start of how we look at not letting medical costs continue to go up. The projection is they'll continue to go up.\n\nAnd it creates a dilemma that if the government is funding those costs and if you're -- you know, you feel your taxation levels are going to hit some -- some limit, then what are you taking money away from?\n\nYou're not going to take it away from your Social Security. You're not going to take it away from paying the debt.\n\nIt's a tough problem.\n\nSo if we could innovate to reduce those increases in costs that would be great. And I think there's a lot of work to be done there, you know, people \u2013 In some respects may be tired of hearing about health care, but in terms of really reducing the costs, no. The -- the years ahead, that's going to -- a lot of experts and politicians are going to have to -- to think about how that's achieved.\n\nTAPPER: Last month, Apple passed Microsoft in market capitalization, making -- it marked a historic moment where -- where Microsoft lost its status as the largest tech company in the world.\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nAnd -- do you still have confidence in CEO, Steve Ballmer?\n\nGATES: Oh, Microsoft is doing a lot of great stuff. I mean the software industry, you know, the opportunities are -- are pretty phenomenal. You know, the way that people think about TV, the way they think about reading, about learning, software is going to revolutionize that. Our company and our stock has gone up, it's gone down. And, you know, we've been the most valuable, not the most valuable. It -- you know, that's -- that changed and it will change again and again and again.\n\nThere's room for more than one company to succeed in the industry. I -- I happen to like the things that Steve's -- Steve's doing. It's not my full-time work, but as a -- a board member, you know, I -- I see a lot of great things going on.\n\nTAPPER: Bill Gates, thanks so much for joining us.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLENO: Eighty-nine-year-old White House reporter Helen Thomas is retiring. I'm going to be the first to say, \"Mazel tov.\"\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): The Democratic Senate nominee in South Carolina, Alvin Greene...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Oh, Alvin.\n\n(UNKNOWN): ... is a mystery man.\n\nGREENE: So we should be pro-South Carolina, rather than anti-Greene, and speaking of me.\n\nSMITH: Where'd you get the $10,000 grand to file?\n\nGREENE: From my own personal money.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Where did he come from, and how did he win?\n\nOLBERMANN: How do you think the people voted for you on Tuesday knew who you were or even that you were running?\n\nGREENE: You know, I think that they -- they saw -- I think that they -- you know, I just think that they recognize -- I think they -- they heard of my name.\n\n(UNKNOWN): This is for real?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yes, I am for real.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: The quizzical stylings of Al Greene, the Democratic Senate candidate in South Carolina, one of many topics we'll get to with our roundtable, starting with George Will, former Republican Congressman Tom Davis, from the University of California at Berkeley, Robert Reich, the former Clinton labor secretary, and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile.\n\nThanks, one and all, for being here. Let's start with the oil spill this week. The fallout from the oil spill became transatlantic, George. Check the headlines that we see here. \"Obama killing all our pensions.\" \"Cameron fails to back BP in fight with Obama.\" \"Back off, Obama.\" This is how the British press is treating this disaster. BP, obviously, the biggest company in the U.K.\n\nDo they have a point?\n\nWILL: Well, sure, they do. This is a reminder to Americans at all time that when they attack Wall Street and big business, they're attacking the people who are supporting their pension funds. I don't know how many Americans depend also on BP, but a lot of them do. It's an internationally traded stock.\n\nSo when you turn on the company, the liability of which is unclear at this point, but Congress, according to the interview you just conducted, is thinking of passing something that looks awfully like a bill of attainder, which is to single out for punishment with specific legislation a particular corporation. This is going to -- to ripple through people's 401(k)s and elsewhere.\n\nTAPPER: Tom, when you were in Congress, you were for a time the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee in charge of electing Republicans to Congress, so you were focused on the mood of the public. What does this oil spill do to the mood of the public?\n\nDAVIS: Well, it adds to the narrative where the big institutions have failed us, government, Wall Street, BP. The anger out there, I think, is greater than we've seen in at least a generation, and this adds to the narrative of government sitting there powerless, just making speeches. It's let them down.\n\nTAPPER: Professor Reich, on -- on Wednesday, when President Obama and other White House officials meet with BP executives -- do you like that, that I called you \"professor\"?\n\nREICH: I do, actually, yes.\n\nTAPPER: You're smiling. When he meets with BP executives, one of the things he'll be pushing for is a -- is an escrow account, a third-party escrow account for BP to put money in, and then a third party will give out this money to people whose lives have been impacted by the spill. Where do you see this headed?\n\nREICH: Well, look, Jake, BP does not have unlimited resources. It has a lot. But inevitably, there is going to be a clash, because the costs of this clean-up, the costs of containing the oil spill damage, the costs of plugging that hole are going to be in the tens of billions of dollars. And the question is, how much of this is going to be borne by the American taxpayer and how much by BP?\n\nBut the present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed up this clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be in charge. The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP's expertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge of all of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, the administration has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem. That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BP to come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to mislead people.\n\nI don't have any sympathy -- and I -- and I probably have some stock or something in BP, because I have mutual funds, so let me just put that aside and say, all the people of Great Britain, this is not personal. This is not about your national identity.\n\nThis is about a big region of our country that now has to deal with an oil spill that will go on for years and years and years, threatening the livelihood of human beings, marine life, sea life, and a way of life for people who make that their homes, 14 million Americans.\n\nSo when it comes to sympathy, angry, love (ph), go down to the Gulf Coast, because we have all of it. And we're angry. Tomorrow, the BP directors will meet. I hope that they hold that money in escrow. I hope...\n\nTAPPER: The dividend -- the dividend money?\n\nBRAZILE: Absolutely. They made $6.8 billion in profit as of March 31st. Hold it in escrow until the investigation is completed. And while they're at it, process these claims.\n\nPeople are waiting, waiting in line now in St. Bernard Parish for food because they cannot go out and fish. They can't hunt, so they can't feed their families. They can't pay their mortgage. I have a lot of anger. I don't want my president to be angry. I have it for him.\n\nREICH: Go beyond escrow. Go into temporary receivership.\n\nTAPPER: You think that the Obama administration should take control of BP or BP America?\n\nREICH: BP America, absolutely, Jake. Otherwise, not only is this a political disaster-in-waiting, because this is going to get larger and larger, and the president looks like he's waiting on the sidelines, but, secondly, we have no way of knowing as American people that BP is actually telling the truth, that all of its resources are being put to the appropriate use, and that it is appropriately balancing the health and safety of Americans against the cost of doing this clean-up.\n\nThis is a for-profit organization, BP, that is answerable to its shareholders, not to the American people.\n\nTAPPER: President Obama is going down to the gulf, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, tomorrow. And when he gets back, he's going to give an address to the nation from the White House Tuesday at 8 o'clock. Last time he went down, his own White House video cameras caught him talking to residents down there, and this is what he had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I can't just dive down there and plug the hole. I can't suck it up with a straw. All I can do is make sure that I put honest, hard-working, smart people in place, like Thad, to implement this thing.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Congressman, this is the president being confronted with the limits of his own abilities, even though he's been a big proponent of government and the ability of government, but here he is saying, \"I can't do this. I can't suck up the oil with a straw.\" This is a dilemma for him.\n\nDAVIS: It is. You know, I did the Katrina report, too, the same kind -- it was an unforgiving storm. And even if you did everything right, there was going to be a lot of anger, a lot of disappointed people. You have the same circumstance here.\n\nBut you have to ask yourself, where was MMS? We've known this has been a dysfunctional organization for years.\n\nTAPPER: The Minerals Management Service.\n\nDAVIS: Absolutely. I held hearings on this when I was in Congress, calling for reorganization and moving it back and forth. There's probably more culpability here than we see. We haven't gotten to the bottom line. It's easy to just blame BP, put it all on them, but I think a thorough investigation is going to show that there was a breakdown all through.\n\nTAPPER: George?\n\nWILL: Well, if there is a breakdown all through, I don't know why he thought it was a propitious moment to start a criminal investigation of a company that is in charge of this and that Bob wants the government to take over on the principle that the government will run another corporation well. I don't understand any of what's going on.\n\nThe president -- and I don't know why he's coming back to talk to us again. He's been talking about this nonstop for five weeks.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, some people believe that he hasn't said enough, George, and that this is his fourth visit.\n\nTAPPER: What could he possibly say, though?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I -- I do believe that he needs to answer some of the questions that have been raised about the containment of the current spill, whether or not there are enough federal resources to contain what has already been in the gulf, to make sure that the states have the proper boomers, the skimmers, and all of the other resources they need -- they need in order to contain the spill.\n\nI think he needs to update us on everything he understands. Look, he may be able to split the sea, but I don't think he can cap the well. And I think it's even foolish to think that the president can -- can split the sea, but politics is in this, and it's draining his political capital, so I think he needs to address this and talk about our addiction to oil, because there are some longer-term issues here, including a moratorium, that needs to be addressed.\n\nTAPPER: Bob, I want to turn briefly, if I could, just to the other crisis that the country is facing. That's the economic crisis. Retail sales figures came out, and I know you wanted to say something about this. They're actually down 1.2 percent during this time that the economy is supposedly recovering. What do you think the significance is?\n\nREICH: Well, this is very unusual, Jake. Hopefully, this is just an aberration, but we have this on top of 41,000 private jobs being created in May...\n\nTAPPER: Not a lot. Not a lot of jobs.\n\nREICH: No. At this stage of recovery, particularly from this deep a recession, you need a lot of job growth, and you also need a lot of retail sales growth.\n\nThe fact is, American consumers just can't afford it. They're coming out from under huge debt loads, and many of them are still facing the prospect of joblessness.\n\nThis is why it is so important -- given the private sector's and consumers' inability to spend more -- for the public sector to spend more, at least in the short term. I mean, the public is not being told -- and here's where presidential education is very important, Donna -- the president is not being -- the president is not educating the public and the public is not being told that there is a huge difference between short-term spending to stimulate the economy and get the economy going again and dealing with the long-term structural deficit, which is mostly about health and Medicare. And these are two different animals entirely.\n\nTAPPER: All right, I want to move to politics now. You guys can talk more about the economy in the green room in the green room segment we have later, but we had some really amazing primaries that happened on Tuesday. In California, especially, where you hail from, Bob, there is the Fiorina versus Boxer race is setting up for the Senate. Carly Fiorina, former HP chairperson, just won the Republican nomination for Senate.\n\nAnd here, right out of the box, is Carly Fiorina's greatest hits while she was wired for sound before a TV interview.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nFIORINA: Laura (ph) saw Barbara Boxer briefly on television this morning and said what everyone says. God, what is that hair?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo yesterday. You didn't...\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: So, Bob, forget the hair. Forget Barbara Boxer's hair for a second. There is a possibility that Barbara Boxer will be so yesterday. She is vulnerable.\n\nREICH: She is vulnerable. I think that what we are seeing in California, again, if you look at the history of this country, everything that is good and everything that's bad starts in California. And what we see in California is a huge, huge amount of spending, Republicans going through the gauntlet of that right-wing Republican primary, forcing Fiorina and also Whitman to the right.\n\nNow, we're not going to have primaries to kick around anymore or parties in California after this year, because Californians, in a -- in a flight of just desperation, said we can't stand it anymore and we're getting rid of parties, especially.\n\nTAPPER: Tom, you wrote a memo to the -- your successor at the National Republican Congressional Committee, Pete Sessions, outlining the lay of the land, what you -- what you think voters are doing right now, what they're thinking right now. What -- what did you tell him?\n\nDAVIS: Well, it's very clear anger today is worse than it was in 1994, 2006, when Congress flipped hands. I mean, that's clear. And the Republicans have had a better recruiting year, I think, than any party has in the last generation, in terms of recruiting challengers. That's on the plus side for the Republicans.\n\nOn the down side is, they still have a party branding issue. The voters threw the Republicans out in 2006 and threw them out in 2008. And when you ask which party is more acceptable, I mean, neither one is, but Democrats actually rank slightly higher than Republicans.\n\nThe Democrats are prepared for this. They have -- all of their candidates have over $1 million in the bank. They've seen this wave coming. They've constructed a high seawall.\n\nYou don't have the open seats the Republicans had in -- in 1994 to shoot out or the Democrats had in 2006. And instead of a wind at your back, it's kind of a crosswind. And if you can be Scott Brown and get your sail up and hoist it right, you can ride it into shore, but just relying on, \"They're the other guys, we're not,\" is not going to work.\n\nThe Republicans have got to take this anger and translate it in districts across the country if they're going to win. They have a possibility of taking the House back. This is not an automatic. This is one of those strange years that voter anger is deep, and all these things we're talking about just add to that narrative.\n\nTAPPER: George, what do you see from Tuesday's results that you find interesting? What conclusions did you draw, if any?\n\nWILL: How hard it is to draw national conclusions about this. In California, Barbara Boxer, 69 years old, running with Jerry Brown, 72 years old, is not a youth movement out there. But Barbara Boxer got more votes, I believe, than Carly Fiorina and her principle challenger, Tom Campbell, combined, even though there was a hotly contested gubernatorial and Senate primaries on the Republican side to bring out the vote.\n\nIn Arkansas, a right-to-work state, out of 1.1 million workers in Arkansas, only 41,000 are unionized workers. Unions went in, spent $10 million, accusing Blanche Lincoln of being insufficiently subservient. And, surprise, surprise, she won. Having won, she starts out 20 points behind her Republican opponent.\n\nAnd in Nevada, Harry Reid might, on a good day, get to 43 percent in Nevada. So he has to figure out in his canny way how to win with 43 percent. Here's how you do it: You spend a lot of money to take down your most -- what you think is your strongest opponent. You pick your opponent.\n\nThere are six other lines on that ballot, independent candidates. That'll disperse the vote. And there's a none-of-the-above in Nevada. You can vote, \"I don't like any of these people.\" So in that sense, he may have brought down to 43 percent the winning total and his -- his threshold of victory.\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk about that Arkansas primary, because Senator Blanche Lincoln did finally defeat Bill Halter, who had been supported by labor unions. And that night that she beat him in the run-off, a White House official -- an anonymous White House official -- called our friend, Ben Smith, at Politico and said, quote, \"Organized labor just flushed $10 million of their members' money down the toilet on a pointless exercise. If even half that total had been well targeted and applied in key House races across the country, that could have made a real difference in November.\"\n\nAsked about the quote, here's what White House press secretary Robert Gibbs had to say. He said, \"First of all, I should say that the president wouldn't agree with that characterization, but\"...\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGIBBS: I think that whether or not that money might have been better spent in the fall on closer elections between somebody -- between people who cared about an agenda that benefited working families and those that didn't, that money might come in more -- more handy then.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Donna, is the White House risking alienating labor with that kind of talk?\n\nBRAZILE: I think, for the most part, labor decided to ignore those comments, although some of them were a little bit -- they were not too satisfied with that comment.\n\nLook, organized labor does not exist to elect Democrats. They exist to help workers, to improve their jobs, their benefits, their pay. So I think the White House needs to be careful in alienating labor, because without organized labor, we don't have the sea legs to go knocking door to door to get the few Democrats that they support elect to office. And I know that from being out there for more than 30 years electing Democrats.\n\nThat said, look, she ran a great campaign. Blanche Lincoln ran a great campaign. She ran against Washington. Labor, the money did make her the outsider. She was able to reconnect with her base, and she pulled her base out. She still has trouble in the general election, but she ran a very smart, strategic campaign.\n\nAnd Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety percent of the people in the state still love him. And he was able to pull out the stops to get her elected.\n\nThis was ladies' night across the country on Tuesday night, ladies' night. It was double or nothing in many states. We have now more female candidates running for governor and senator as a result of the -- the voter anger out there, and so that's a good -- that's a good sign for women candidates.\n\nThat said, not all women are equal in this battle. I thought Carly Fiorina's comments about Barbara Boxer was catty. It was old-school. And we've long since stopped talking about women's hair, headlines (ph), coat jackets, et cetera. We don't talk about male grooming or their ties, so she should get better on her message.\n\nTAPPER: I get comments about my ties all the time.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, that's because you're married to a smart woman.\n\nBut, you know, the Republicans spent a lot of money to -- to win in California, $100 million. That's a lot of...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: You know, let me -- let me...\n\nREICH: And it was their -- and it was their own money. Let me just say that in that gubernatorial race, in that primary, we had two candidates who spent $100 million of their own money.\n\nTAPPER: And let's talk about that for one second, because -- because the other CEO running for governor, as opposed to Senate with Fiorina, is Meg Whitman from eBay. And here's Jerry Brown. He is the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and he told a local reporter, \"You know, by the time Whitman's done with me two months from now, I'll be a child-molesting\" -- he let the line trail off. \"She'll have people believing whatever she wants about me. It's like Goebbels. Goebbels invented this kind of propaganda. He took control of the whole world. She wants to be president. That's her ambition, the first woman president. That's what this is all about.\"\n\nBob, regardless of the tastelessness of comparing Meg Whitman to a Nazi propagandist, Jerry Brown has a point in the sense -- not the Goebbels part of it -- but in the sense that she has a lot of money. She spent $70 million of her own money just in the primary.\n\nREICH: Well, again, California is the future. It means that, essentially, the ground war, the organizing on the ground, is really less and less important. And if you can spend a huge amount of money -- or you, like Jerry Brown, have a brand-name recognition -- you can get through and possibly be elected. But if you don't have a lot of money of your own and don't have brand-name recognition, you can basically forget it.\n\nWILL: But California also has a history of very rich candidates losing. There is such a thing as declining marginal utility of the last dollar spent, and the Republicans may be reaching that.\n\nDAVIS: And we're seeing campaign finance reform, really, that parties are -- they -- they no longer have the value. What's happened is the money has moved away with the political parties with the new (ph) -- out to the Tea Party, the Club for Growth, MoveOn.org, to labor. So the party establishments don't have the kind of power they once did.\n\nREICH: But connect the dots. I think this is a very important point, Tom. I mean, we've got so much anger in the electorate. Why? Because, A, we've got an economy that is not functioning for many people. B, we have a lot of physical representation of things out of control, such as the blow in the -- in -- in the gulf.\n\nAnd, thirdly, we have political parties that people now feel are not representing them at all. So there's this kind of anti-establishment earthquake going on in the country, and politicians ought to be aware. It's not just incumbents.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, I just -- we only have 30 seconds. You just talked to the South Carolina Democratic Party chair, Carol Fowler, about this bizarre nomination of Alvin Greene. Very quickly, what did she tell you?\n\nBRAZILE: It's a mystery. No one understands it. They can't -- no one can explain it. And there are all kind of conspiracy theories out there. Some of them I might ascribe myself to at some point. This guy came from nowhere, walked in with a cashier's check with his name scrawled on it, went back home to his dad's house, never campaigned, never cut a radio spot, a robo-call, and won.\n\nTAPPER: OK, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room on abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up with PolitiFact to fact check the show.",

    "text":"Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases.\n\nPresident Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address.\n\nBut conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate.\n\n\"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,\" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. \"Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nPolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.\n\nGo to the polls\n\nUnder current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.\n\nNational polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:\n\nQuinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: \"Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?\" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure\/No answer: 1 percent.\n\nCBS\/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: \"Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?\" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure\/No answer: 1 percent.\n\nGallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: \"Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?\" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.\n\nQuinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: \"Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?\" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure\/No answer: 1 percent.\n\nPew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose \"making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks\"? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure\/Refused: 2 percent.\n\nPew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.\n\nSo are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham\u2019s producers and didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.\n\nFor example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post\/Pew Research Center poll.\n\nSome gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.\n\nThis highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.\n\nThe same October CBS\/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.\n\n\"People don't seem to like the idea of \u2018gun control,\u2019 but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,\" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIngraham said, \"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.\"\n\nNumerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.\n\nWhile there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings \u2014 such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation \u2014 there hasn\u2019t been a definitive debunking of the statistic.\n\nWe rate Ingraham\u2019s claim False.",

    "text":"Knox College\n\nGalesburg, Illinois\n\n12:13 P.M. CDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Galesburg! (Applause.) Well, it\u2019s good to be home in Illinois! (Applause.) It is good to be back. It\u2019s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.\n\n\n\nI want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who\u2019s here. (Applause.) We've got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nI see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he\u2019s got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so they\u2019ve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesn\u2019t have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.\n\n\n\nDick Durbin couldn\u2019t make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) He\u2019s doing a great job. And we\u2019ve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we\u2019re going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd all of you are here, and it\u2019s great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nSo, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. Didn\u2019t even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didn\u2019t work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.\n\n\n\nAnd on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented what\u2019s best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nSee, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries weren\u2019t keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.\n\n\n\nIn the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.\n\n\n\nBut over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.\n\n\n\nAnd so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people\u2019s wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged.\n\n\n\nAnd towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.\n\n\n\nNow, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we\u2019re off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.\n\n\n\nAnd because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of Honda\u2019s cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, they\u2019re building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- they\u2019re bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We\u2019re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- we\u2019ve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.\n\n\n\nAs a country, we\u2019ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.\n\n\n\nBut -- and here's the big \u201cbut\u201d -- I\u2019m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who\u2019ve been out of work for some time.\n\n\n\nToday, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven\u2019t seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they\u2019re going to be able to retire.\n\n\n\nSo in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.\n\n\n\nThis growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it\u2019s bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why reversing these trends has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) It\u2019s certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasn\u2019t just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what we\u2019ve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn\u2019t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.\n\n\n\nThen, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we don\u2019t need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks who\u2019ve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAlmost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.\n\n\n\nThen, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.\n\n\n\nBut you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who won\u2019t even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America\u2019s farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they\u2019ll shift the topic to \u201cout-of-control government spending\u201d \u2013- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nOr they\u2019ll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they\u2019ve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people who\u2019ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they\u2019ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) That\u2019s what this is about. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we've been fighting for.\n\n\n\nBut with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.\n\n\n\nThis moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That\u2019s what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That\u2019s why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need to be talking about. That\u2019s what Washington needs to be focused on.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. That\u2019s what we need. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need right now. That\u2019s what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, some of these ideas I\u2019ve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, of course, we\u2019ll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. We\u2019ve got to standing up for civil rights. We\u2019ve got to stand up for women\u2019s rights. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo all those issues are important, and we\u2019ll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don\u2019t have a growing, thriving middle class then we won\u2019t have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won\u2019t have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.\n\n\n\nNow, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what\u2019s at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I\u2019ll use it. (Applause.) Where I can\u2019t act on my own and Congress isn\u2019t cooperating, I\u2019ll pick up the phone -- I\u2019ll call CEOs; I\u2019ll call philanthropists; I\u2019ll call college presidents; I\u2019ll call labor leaders. I\u2019ll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children\u2019s future, our grandchildren\u2019s future, for all Americans.\n\nSo let me give you a quick preview of what I\u2019ll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.\n\n\n\nNow, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So I\u2019m going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe want to make sure that -- we\u2019re going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- I\u2019m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let\u2019s tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know there\u2019s an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let\u2019s put some folks to work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But we\u2019ve got work to do all across the country. We\u2019ve got ports that aren\u2019t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two years\u2019 time. If we don\u2019t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We\u2019ve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nBusinesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can\u2019t be outsourced. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, this isn\u2019t a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that\u2019s inefficient at a time when it\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s been since the 1950s to build things. It\u2019s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.\n\n\n\nThe longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They\u2019ll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we\u2019ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIn an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they\u2019ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they\u2019ll reward those folks with good pay.\n\n\n\nThe days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn\u2019t need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they\u2019re not going away. Those old days aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\n\nSo we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. That\u2019s what we have to do. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they\u2019re going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t make this investment, we\u2019re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don\u2019t require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of America\u2019s students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. We\u2019re making that happen right now. (Applause.) We\u2019ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didn\u2019t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to challenge CEOs from some of America\u2019s best companies to hire more Americans who\u2019ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 an honest look.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That, too.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that\u2019s straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and that\u2019s the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn\u2019t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That\u2019s in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, we\u2019re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo this is all a good start -- but it isn\u2019t enough. Families and taxpayers can\u2019t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We\u2019ll never have enough loan money, we\u2019ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. We\u2019ve got to get more out of what we pay for.\n\n\n\nNow, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, they\u2019re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.\n\n\n\nSo this afternoon, I\u2019ll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who\u2019s willing to work for it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, so you\u2019ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, that\u2019s your biggest asset. For most families, that\u2019s where your life\u2019s work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, we\u2019ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn\u2019t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.\n\n\n\nSo already, I\u2019ve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney\u2019s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We\u2019ll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system that\u2019s rock-solid for future generations.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It\u2019s getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.\n\n\n\nNow, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they don\u2019t have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nGood job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.\n\n\n\nFifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you\u2019ve worked a lifetime to build.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if you\u2019re one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don\u2019t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- that\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you\u2019d buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.\n\n\n\nAnd if you're one of the up to half of all Americans who\u2019ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act does. That\u2019s what it does. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I don\u2019t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don\u2019t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that\u2019s a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.\n\n\n\nSo just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're paying today -- 50 percent lower. (Applause.) So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who\u2019ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents' plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, you'll have the security of knowing that everything you\u2019ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nFinally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- I\u2019m going to make the case for why we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who haven't quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we\u2019ve never guaranteed success -- that's not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. (Applause.) We've tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. That's all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you're willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too. That's the American idea. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years. And that\u2019s a betrayal of the American idea. And that\u2019s why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class.\n\n\n\nThe best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community. So we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. (Applause.) We need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe're not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life\u2019s biggest winners or losers. And after years in which we\u2019ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break. A plant leaves. Somebody gets sick. Somebody loses a home. We've seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors. We've seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.\n\n\n\nSo good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- that's where I will focus my energies. (Applause.) That's where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.\n\n\n\nThese are the plans that I'll lay out across this country. But I won\u2019t be able to do it alone, so I'm going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We\u2019ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I\u2019ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I\u2019m going to highlight the ones that do just that.\n\n\n\nThere are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. (Applause.) Companies like -- there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it\u2019s not just good for the employees, it\u2019s good for their businesses to treat workers well. It\u2019s good for America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats we\u2019ve got to question some of our old assumptions. We\u2019ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to be willing to -- we\u2019ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We can't just -- Democrats can't just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing. If we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and I believe that -- we\u2019ve an obligation to prove it. And that means that we\u2019ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of you\u2019ve said before; some of them sound great, but you can't get those through Congress. Republicans won\u2019t agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I\u2019ll be proposing. I know because they\u2019ve said so. But they worry they\u2019ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.\n\n\n\nNow, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they\u2019re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.\n\n\n\nIn either case, I say to these members of Congress: I\u2019m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it\u2019s time for you to lay out your ideas. (Applause.) You can't just be against something. You got to be for something. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEven if you think I\u2019ve done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it\u2019s not enough for you just to oppose me. You got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you\u2019re willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country\u2019s infrastructure, let\u2019s go. If you\u2019ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let\u2019s hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nRepealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you\u2019re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I\u2019m ready to work. (Applause.) But you should know that I will not accept deals that don\u2019t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since I first took office. (Applause.) As a country, we\u2019re older and wiser. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wiser, but I\u2019m certainly older. (Laughter.) And as long as Congress doesn\u2019t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don\u2019t shut down the government just because I\u2019m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don\u2019t risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we\u2019ve already racked up, something that we\u2019ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don\u2019t do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, that\u2019s our choice. If we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money\u2019s power will distort our politics even more.\n\n\n\nSocial tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn\u2019t improving. And the fundamental optimism that\u2019s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the vision I have for this country. It\u2019s not the vision you have for this country. That\u2019s not the America we know. That\u2019s not the vision we should be settling for. That\u2019s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.\n\n\n\nI have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that\u2019s how to use every minute -- (applause) -- the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term -- (laughter) -- to make this country work for working Americans again. (Applause.) That\u2019s all I care about. I don\u2019t have another election. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019ll tell you, Galesburg, that\u2019s where I believe America needs to go. I believe that\u2019s where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we\u2019re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we\u2019ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger five years from now. It will be stronger 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd in the end, isn't that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. (Applause.) We haven\u2019t just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWhen we think about our own communities -- we're not a mean people; we're not a selfish people; we're not a people that just looks out for \u201cnumber one.\u201d Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That\u2019s why we don\u2019t call it John\u2019s dream or Susie\u2019s dream or Barack\u2019s dream or Pat's dream -- we call it the American Dream. And that\u2019s what makes this country special -- the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we're fighting for.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, Congress is tough right now, but that\u2019s not going to stop me. We're going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. We're going to go on the road and talk to you, and you'll have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we're going to focus on this thing that matters.\n\n\n\nOne of America\u2019s greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago -- (applause) -- he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie, and then the prairie sent out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful -- how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote, \u201cI speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, America, we\u2019ve made it through the worst of yesterday\u2019s winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. We've got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love.\n\n\n\nSo thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEND\n\n1:17 P.M. CDT",

We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.\n\nThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.",

Good to see you.\n\nSo, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIf they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\nThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBen Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.\n\nWe think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.\n\nNow, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.\n\nTAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?\n\nGEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.\n\nTAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --\n\nGEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.\n\nTAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?\n\nGEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.\n\nTAPPER: So, before the election?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.\n\nTAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.\n\nAre you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus?\n\nGEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.\n\nTAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that.\n\nGEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.\n\nNow, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.\n\nTAPPER: By the private sector.\n\nGEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession.\n\nTAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.\n\nGEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical.\n\nAnd you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress.\n\nTAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.\n\nGiven the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.\n\nTAPPER: Many of the details on the Wall Street Reform Bill that President Obama just signed will be determined by regulators. In fact, the bill also gives more power to some regulators, some of the same ones who failed us the last time around.\n\nWhy should we be confident that they're going to get it right either with the rule making or next time there's a crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: Excellent question. But actually, the theory, the basic strategy in this reform bill does not rest on the wisdom of regulators. It does two very important things, though. It'll help consumers make better choices with better disclosure, much more clarity about the terms of the credit card contract or mortgage loan so they get better protection against the risk of being taken advantage of.\n\nBut it also gives authority we did not have to put in place strong constraints on risk taking on all the nation's largest institutions. That authority did not exist before and it was central to what caused the near collapse of the financial system.\n\nTAPPER: Will these powers have allowed you, if had been Secretary of Treasury at the time or your predecessor Hank Paulsen to have staved off the financial crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think there's any reform bill, no law in any country that can prevent all financial crises. But if we had had this authority as a country, it -- we would have been able to limit risk taking and deal with the trauma that came from the stakes these firms made much more easily. It would have caused much less damage. It would have been much less severe, caused much less damage to the basic fortunes Americans and businesses across the country and to our -- and our long term fiscal position.\n\nTAPPER: You eluded to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was created. Many liberals and labor unions and consumer groups say there's one person they want for that job. Elizabeth Warren. The woman who thought it up.\n\nDo you support that idea?\n\nGEITHNER: She is a enormously effective advocate for reform. Probably the most effective advocate for reform for consumers for consumer protection in the country. She has huge credibility and she played a decisive role in helping make the public case for reform and she was early on this, way ahead of everybody else.\n\nTAPPER: 2007 she wrote that -- that -- she came up with that idea.\n\nGEITHNER: And even before that she was pointing out to people the risks of what's happening in the housing market and credit market. So she has enormous credibility and she'd be an excellent leader of that institution. But that's a decision the President's going to make.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the White House say that -- that you've had concerns about her appointment because she she's been a sharp critic of you, she's been a sharp critic of Treasury Department policies. Do you have concerns?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't have concerns and I should say in that context that she has been playing a very important role in providing oversight over the programs we put in place to break the back of this financial crisis. You know, put out this financial fire.\n\nTAPPER: Ken Feinberg issued a report including that U.S. banks paid out $1.6 billion in unwanted -- unwarranted bonuses to top earners during the height of the meltdown. Seventeen banks made these payouts after getting TARP funds, after getting bailout funds.\n\nGEITHNER: It's a -- you know, it really is an incredible thing. And that's what he reminded of which is in early '09, on the basis of performance in '08, in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, firms that had taken support from the government because they could not manage without it still paid out substantial sums of money to people who made the decisions that caused the crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Is there nothing that can be done about this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, you know, he spoke to that earlier this week. What he did do, though, and this was enormously effective was he went and used the authority he had to change behavior going forward. So you didn't have taxpayers' money after he had that authority go to enrich the people that had brought the system to the edge of collapse.\n\nNow, what he's also done and what our responsibility is to make sure these firms can never again go back to paying their executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the country as a whole, the economy as a whole. So, he's done a great job. Very tough judgments. Limited authority in some cases, but he uses authority very well.\n\nTAPPER: Why is it that U.S. automakers when they received bailout funds had to take serious steps to take -- what are called \"haircuts\"? Salary reductions, layoffs. And banks didn't. Banks -- I mean, you had Ken Feinberg supervising their salaries as long as they were receiving TARP money, but then they paid the money back and did whatever they wanted. How come banks didn't have to do that?\n\nGEITHNER: Great question. And that's why we have financial reform. Because we had for the country as a whole, a process of bankruptcy for dealing with failure. We did not have a similar process that could deal with the failure of large financial institutions.\n\nThat was a tragic failure for the country because what it meant is when firms like AIG or Lehman or Bear Stearns manage themselves to the point where they could not survive without the government, we had no tools like bankruptcy to force them to restructure and protect the taxpayer from losses. But what this financial reform will do is to give us that authority. A type of bankruptcy regime that we can use for these large institutions because, again, this is a basic commitment in the bill. Banks should be paying for the cost of bank failures. We don't want the taxpayers paying for the cost of bank failures. And we should have the ability to dismember them, put them out of existence, put them out of their misery without it causing catastrophic damage to the economy as a whole.\n\nTAPPER: The Treasury Department issued a currency report and concluded that China was not manipulating its currency. Very few legislators on Capitol Hill seem to agree with that report, and I'm wondering if you agree with it.\n\nGEITHNER: Well, what China did, and this is the important thing, after a long period of pegging their currency to the dollar, holding their currency constant against the dollar, they have now started to allow it to move upward again to appreciate, to strengthen their response to market forces.\n\nNow, of course, they just started that process. It's just the beginning, and what matters to us and to all of China's trading partners is that they let that currency appreciate, as they did the last time they allowed us to move. What matters to us is how fast and how far they let it go.\n\nTAPPER: But you stand by the idea, stand by the assertion, that China is not manipulating its currency?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. But again, they begin the process of letting it start to reflect market forces. That's very good for China. It's very good for the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, this has been an odd week for the Obama administration -- not necessarily for the Treasury Department, but for the Obama administration, given the whole kerfuffle with Shirley Sherrod and the Agriculture Department. President Obama has said this is a teaching moment for him and his administration. Secretary Vilsack said something similar.\n\nDid you learn anything from watching your colleagues go through this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, as the president said, I think you saw a general rush to judgment everywhere -- in the press and outside the press. And I think I agree with it -- it's something that we should all take some caution from and look at these things carefully. But he spoke to that, I thought, well earlier this week.\n\nTAPPER: Secretary Geithner, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nGEITHNER: Thanks, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: And joining me now is someone who also knows from budget challenges, New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie. Governor, thank you so much. Welcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: I'm happy to be here.\n\nTAPPER: So, Governor, your victory last November in the very blue state of New Jersey was heralded by Republicans nationally, seen as a blueprint for their victories. Now, a lot of Republicans who wanted you to win and admired your campaign said that you won mainly by criticizing incumbent Democratic Governor Corzine, not necessarily by a specific, detailed agenda.\n\nAnd I'm wondering if, first of all, you agree with that. And, second of all, how do you see your victory in the context of what Republicans can do this November?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first off, Jake, I think what we did in New Jersey last year was say very specifically what direction we wanted to take the state in. We said we wanted to have less spending, smaller government, lower taxes, and commonsense regulation that was going to help to grow private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I didn't go line item by line item through the budget during a campaign, and I didn't think it was the right thing to do.\n\nNow, in terms of what it tells us going forward, I think Republicans across the country need to get back to our brand, and I think that is the Republican brand. It's why I became a Republican: less government, lower taxes, less spending, and commonsense regulation that grows private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I think if my win tells anything, it means if we get back to basics as Republicans, then we speak to some of the concerns people have in New Jersey and across the country.\n\nTAPPER: You know, the biggest item on your agenda so far has been dealing with the budget and the huge deficit in New Jersey. Here you are on CNBC.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: We passed a budget that cuts $11 billion from our state's budget, balances it without any new tax increases on the people of the state of New Jersey.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Patrick Murray, director of polling at Monmouth University, says, quote, \"That's a nice talking point, but it's absolutely untrue. There are a lot of legal obligations that the state has that the governor just simply ignored.\" And the Star-Ledger reported, \"Budget analysts say the $11 billion deficit was closed largely by avoiding massive costs. The budget skipped a $3.1 billion payment to the pension fund, continuing a decade-long pattern Christie had criticized, and did not pay $1.7 billion to schools under the state's formula for education aid.\"\n\nSo these billions that you're not funding, are you doing this just by executive fiat? How does this work? Because they're legal obligations, right?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, listen, the legislature passed this budget. The budget I presented on March 16th has $11 billion in less spending than was projected to be done through the Corzine administration.\n\nAnd so Patrick Murray is a pollster, and he's OK as a pollster, but he's not going to be all that great as a governor, because what we did here was we took $1.7 billion less in education funding. Well, a billion of that was federal stimulus money that had been spent in one year by the Corzine administration, and we were left with $1 billion hole. Really what we did was we reduced it by about $820 million in educational spending.\n\nAcross the board, Jake, we had to reduce spending. Every department of state government was cut. And so there are going to be some cuts you make you like and some that you like less, but when you have an $11 billion hole to fill, you have to fill it.\n\nFinally, on pensions, I wasn't going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system. We need pension reform. I passed some already for new hires in March, and now this fall we're going to go after current employees and pension reform and health benefit reform because we're going broke.\n\nTAPPER: Now, one -- in that clip, you said that there were no new tax increases on people of the state of New Jersey, but also your budget did not fund $1 billion in direct property tax rebates, the homestead rebate. That means that people's property taxes are going to go up.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, no, what we did, Jake, was we did a couple of things. First, we changed it from a property tax rebate program to a direct credit. We spent about $20 million a year in processing these checks and borrowing the money to send out to people. We've eliminated that.\n\nAnd what we did was we skipped three-quarters of that payment in the current fiscal year as part of the shared sacrifice that everybody was going to have to make. I wasn't going to cut just programs for the vulnerable; I wasn't going to cut just programs for the rich, but programs for the middle class. Everything had to be cut.\n\nBut that program will be back as a direct tax credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11.\n\nTAPPER: Now, that shared sacrifice -- I mean, is that not a tax increase, even if it's a -- I mean, if you're -- if you're taking away a tax rebate, even temporarily, that's a tax increase, isn't it?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, I don't -- I don't see it that way. And in addition, what we did was we're giving the tools now to municipalities with a 2 percent property tax cap that we passed this July by me calling the legislature back into special session and with the tools that we're going to be passing this fall for them to cut spending even more at the municipal level so that people are not going to see a huge increase over the course of the next four years in their property taxes at all.\n\nTAPPER: OK, there's been a lot of tension between you and teachers, as you've been wielding your budget ax. Here's one example from a recent town hall meeting.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): You're not compensating me for my education and you're not compensating me for my experience. That's...\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, you know what? Then you don't have to do it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Teachers do it because they love it. That's the only reason I do it.\n\nCHRISTIE: That's good. Well, then -- well, and you -- and, listen, and teachers go into knowing what the pay scale is.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: I know you said your issue is with teachers' unions and not with individual teachers, but what do you say to residents of your state who say that they like your stance on taking on the teachers' unions, but a clip like that makes it seems like you don't really respect the teaching profession.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, I do respect the teaching profession. I'm a product of the public schools in the state of New Jersey, and I care deeply about our public education.\n\nBut here's what we can't have any longer: We can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession at the cost to the people who have been hurt by the recession the most.\n\nFor instance, the building trade unions in our state, they have unemployment at 35 percent to 50 percent. They're getting no raises. They're getting no benefits any longer, yet their property taxes continue to go up to pay for 4 percent and 5 percent salary increases demanded by the teachers' unions in a 0 percent inflation world and that most of the teachers in New Jersey, because of their unions, pay nothing towards their health benefits from the day they're hired until the day they die.\n\nNow, I have to tell you, Jake, we can't have one set of rules for one small sector -- the public sector unions -- and a different set of rules for everyone who's being hurt by this recession and say that those people are being hurt the most by the recession. By the way, you pay for this special treatment.\n\nI mean, now, that may be tough talk to people, and it's direct, but candidly, that's what we have to do if we want to get budgets under control in New Jersey and around the country.\n\nTAPPER: You're -- you've been known in the statehouse and nationally for a blunt style. Here's an example of that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: Like it or not, you guys are stuck with me for four years, and I'm going to say things directly. When you ask me questions, I'm going to answer them directly, straightly, bluntly, and nobody in New Jersey is going to have to wonder where I am on an issue.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: That's a high bar, so let's do it. Directly, straightly, bluntly, should New Jersey join the lawsuit that other states have filed against the Obama administration over the individual mandate in the health care reform bill?\n\nCHRISTIE: I have both my attorney general and my commissioner of health studying two things: first, what are the chances of succeeding in the lawsuit? Because with limited resources in New Jersey, I'm not going to throw good money after bad. And, secondly, what's the effect of this 2,000-page bill going to be on the people of New Jersey? When I get answers back from them, I'll make a decision.\n\nTAPPER: What's your impulse?\n\nCHRISTIE: I don't have an impulse. I'm waiting to get briefed on it.\n\nTAPPER: Immigration reform. You've said this issue is too important to demagogue. Who is demagoguing in the Senate right now? And what is the solution to immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first of all, on demagoguing, I wasn't talking about anything that's going on now. That's a 2-year-old quote, and there were some things going on in New Jersey at the time while I was U.S. attorney that I thought was demagoguery, and I called it that.\n\nListen, this issue is a federal issue that should be handled by the feds and should be fixed finally. As a former United States attorney, I had to deal with these issues for seven years, and we simply didn't have the resources to deal with them effectively.\n\nSo the president and the Congress have to step up to the plate, they have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people.\n\nAnd until they do that, states are going to struggle all over the country with this problem, and so is federal law enforcement, who doesn't have the resources to do it effectively.\n\nTAPPER: Is the Republican Party in Congress been a help or hindrance to that cause for immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think it depends on which Republican you're talking about. I don't think the party has had a generalized stance. I think there's been, you know, folks who have been all over the map on this issue. And, candidly, I don't think there's one general Republican position.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there are Democrats offering a bill, and they can't -- they can't get any Republicans to join them.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen, the fact of the matter is that they have to find a way to build consensus. And I think that's what the president said he wanted to do when he came to town, and I think that's the challenge for those who are in the majority: find a way to build consensus.\n\nThat's what I've been doing in New Jersey, Jake. We have a Democratic legislature. I've passed a budget with those $11 billion in cuts with a Democratic legislature, a property tax cap with a Democratic legislature, pension reforms with a Democratic legislature.\n\nIf you want to lead and build consensus, you can, and it's on the obligation of those people in charge to build consensus.\n\nTAPPER: Two more quick questions. One, the stimulus bill. Net positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think short-term positive, and we're now feeling the negative.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, I know you like to talk about New Jersey's cultural icons. You prefer to talk about Springsteen, but the New York Times today has this profile of Snooki from \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: Sure.\n\nTAPPER: MTV's \"Jersey Shore,\" positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: Negative for New Jersey, I mean, because it -- what it does is it takes a bunch of New Yorkers, who are -- most of the people on \"Jersey Shore\" are New Yorkers -- takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them at the Jersey shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey.\n\nI could tell people, they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time. The Jersey shore is a beautiful place, and it's a place that everybody should come on vacation this summer. We've got another six weeks or so of summer left. Come to New Jersey.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Christie, thanks so much for -- for sharing your views.\n\nCHRISTIE: Thank you, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: The roundtable is next with Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Donna Brazile, and Stephen Hayes. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately.\n\nSHERROD: I was faced with having to help a white person save their land, so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.\n\n(UNKNOWN): The full speech has been released by the NAACP, and it backs up Ms. Sherrod's version.\n\nTAPPER: Apparently she's watching this briefing, Shirley Sherrod, on CNN right now. Is there anything you want to say to her?\n\nGIBBS: On behalf of the administration, I offer our apologies.\n\nVILSACK: I asked for Shirley's forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me.\n\n(UNKNOWN): He jumped the gun.\n\nSHERROD: To have people think that I was a racist really, really hurt.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: L'affaire Sherrod, one of the many topics we'll talk about on our roundtable today with Stephen Hayes from the Weekly Standard and Fox News Channel, Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist and our dear friend, and ABC News' own Sam Donaldson, and, of course, Cokie Roberts.\n\nThanks, all of you, for being here.\n\nWe'll get to Sherrod in a second, but first I just want to talk a little bit about the Geithner interview. Secretary Geithner said he hopes there isn't going to be much of a fight over trying to keep the tax cuts for the lower income, under $200,000, $250,000 for a family, but repeal them or let them expire for wealthier Americans. Is there going to be a fight?\n\nHAYES: Yes, hope will only take you so far. I think there will be a fight, and I think one of the main constituencies in the fight is going to be moderate Democrats, as you pointed out in your questioning of him.\n\nI think you're going to see moderate Democrats who walk back from the administration's eagerness to see this tax hike on what they're calling the wealthiest Americans.\n\nTAPPER: Donna?\n\nBRAZILE: The 2011 budget anticipates that we can close the deficit largely by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. I think the president should not get into the argument should he, should he not, but rather to present a series of -- a new tax package. Don't call it Bush tax cuts, but a new tax package that is aimed toward the middle class, towards small businesses, that will close tax loopholes, and to ensure that the -- whatever package we put forward is fiscally prudent, it's paid for, and that it helps spur economic growth.\n\nTAPPER: Sam, where do you think this is going?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, of course, they should continue those tax cuts for 95 percent, as Secretary Geithner said. And as far as the wealthy are concerned to go from 35 percent as the top rate before the deductions to 39 percent is not going to kill them. It really won't. They're going to have something to eat the next day.\n\nBut here's my proposal. There is a point...\n\nTAPPER: A proposal from Sam Donaldson.\n\nDONALDSON: Here's my proposal.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I like that.\n\nDONALDSON: There is a point that at this moment perhaps we should continue to extend the tax cuts across the board, but put in a trigger. When our national product gets better, when our unemployment gets better, use some other indexes. Then the trigger automatically raises it for the wealthy back to 39 percent.\n\nROBERTS: Triggers never work. We've put in triggers -- Congress puts in triggers all the time. It's basically fig leaves, and then they don't -- they don't ever do it.\n\nDONALDSON: The reason it doesn't work, Cokie, is that Congress doesn't follow through.\n\nROBERTS: That's my point.\n\nDONALDSON: I don't think there's a chance that Republicans would agree with my modest suggestion.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... look, it's obviously not just an economic question. It's a political question. And -- and who gets to frame it? Do the Democrats get to say the Republicans claim that they're against the deficit, but they want to keep in all these tax cuts for those really rich people, including those Wall Street bankers who got those huge bonuses, or do the Republicans say, look, here are Democrats going at you again, raising your taxes just so they can -- just so they can raise that spending, because they want the government to take over every -- every part of American life?\n\nAnd I think that's a lot of what this debate will be framed around and what this election will be framed around.\n\nTAPPER: And this debate comes as Ben Bernanke, the Fed chair, is calling the economic outlook unusually uncertain, which is chilling words for some people.\n\nROBERTS: Including the market. I mean, he said those words and 200 points down.\n\nDONALDSON: The market is beginning to start to levitate again, maybe unwisely, but Europe has produced better numbers just this past week. The earnings season looks really good for some of the big companies, not just the banks, but some of the companies, Caterpillar, some of the people who make things. I think we're going to come out of it.\n\nHAYES: But the numbers are mixed. I mean, that's the rosy scenario.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: The numbers are mixed, and there are plenty of numbers that are pointing in the other direction. I think if you look at the big picture, the question I think facing -- facing sort of everybody in Washington right now with respect to the tax cuts, one of the things that surprised me most about your interview with Tim Geithner was that he said raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans won't have a negative effect on growth, that was a stunning statement to me.\n\nI think you could poll 1,000 economists and find very few of them who would agree with what Tim Geithner just said, and one of those people is Christina Romer in the White House, who has written before about the negative effects of tax cuts, and, in fact, has an article...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Of tax increases.\n\nHAYES: ... of tax increases, and has an article in the current American Economic Review, June 2010, in which she says tax increases have a large and substantial negative effect on consumption and growth.\n\nROBERTS: Now, they have to be really especially careful about the estate tax, however, because...\n\nDONALDSON: There is none.\n\nROBERTS: Well, there isn't one at the moment.\n\nTAPPER: There's not right now. And the heirs of George Steinbrenner are happy for that.\n\nROBERTS: Exactly. So then if they bring it back, they'd better do it overnight, you know, so that people aren't doing in their parents in anticipation.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, you wanted to say something?\n\nBRAZILE: Everyone is concerned about the deficit, and that's why we have to be careful how we frame this. I mean, you and I both know that -- Stephen, that over the last 10 years we've seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown. Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, they've seen their wages stagnate.\n\nSo I think the president needs to be wise enough to take a look at the entire array of tax cuts that he could provide to small businesses and middle-income individuals that will help spur economic growth.\n\nROBERTS: But, of course, the one number that matters is the unemployment number. I mean, that is the number that everybody really cares about. And -- and the president himself is now saying, again, expected to get to 8 percent or lower until maybe the end of 2012.\n\nAnd that -- you know, that then becomes not only a dampening -- have a dampening effect on the economy, but that becomes...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: There are two commissions...\n\nROBERTS: ... political problem.\n\nDONALDSON: ... running right now, the presidential commission appointed and a private one with Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin that are looking at this problem of our debt and our economic situation, and both of them say, by the end of the year when they report, we're going to be stunned by the projections for this country if we don't start cutting unnecessary expenses and getting hold of the debt.\n\nROBERTS: Well...\n\nTAPPER: It's not just unnecessary expenses. Some of them are necessary expenses. It's Medicare and Social Security.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... building a second engine for a fighter that the Defense Department says is unnecessary?\n\nROBERTS: Well, you know perfectly well, Sam, that that doesn't save you any money. I mean, you start...\n\nDONALDSON: Oh, a few billion.\n\nROBERTS: You could close down this Capitol or turn it into condos and you could close down every domestic program that we have and you'd still have a deficit because of Social Security, Medicare...\n\nDONALDSON: That's defense spending.\n\nROBERTS: ... and interest on the national debt.\n\nBRAZILE: And the loss of revenues. I mean, this recession has taken a bite out of the economy. We're not collecting money, so we need to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Particularly on capital gains.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right.\n\nHAYES: Which -- which is why the single most important thing the government can do right now is get out of the way of private-sector growth. And raising taxes in a recession on whomever is, I think, one of the most foolish things you could possibly do at this time.\n\nAnd, look, the administration implicitly buys the argument that raising taxes in a recession is a bad idea. You've heard administration officials articulate this before, and it's behind what they did in the original stimulus with the tax cuts.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: So sign on to the idea that now it's a bad idea, but at some point we're going to come out of this recession.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there is -- and there are voices in the administration...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... and now they raised them, OK?\n\nTAPPER: ... talking about -- there are people in the administration talking about maybe just keeping the Bush tax cuts in place for everyone for a year longer...\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's what you were saying.\n\nTAPPER: ... or not, but Geithner said no.\n\nDONALDSON: But a trigger. Otherwise the Congress will never come back and say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: ... have the same debate -- have the same debate in two years.\n\nBRAZILE: I'm going to be like the Republicans for 30 seconds. How do we pay for it? How do we pay for it? We know that the Bush tax cuts is one of the driving forces...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: It is -- it is part of it, but that's on static scoring. If you look at what it does for economic growth, you could argue that you'll make up some of the revenues...\n\nBRAZILE: So how many jobs were created during its period when we had the Bush tax cuts, from 2001 to 2008? How many jobs?\n\nHAYES: I don't -- I don't know the number.\n\nBRAZILE: Hardly any. We lost jobs. That's the point. The point is, we should have tax cuts that help spur economic growth. Bottom line, it's about jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nROBERTS: I think that's right. The question is, what cuts? And not just \"cuts.\" And I think that...\n\nHAYES: Sure, OK. Let's say that small business is the engine for job growth.\n\nBRAZILE: I agree with that.\n\nHAYES: But the people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners. So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can...\n\nDONALDSON: Most of the wealthy...\n\nHAYES: ... put people back to work, that's who you're talking about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... most of the wealthy, the top 3 percent are small-business owners? Wrong. There are some, yes, of course.\n\nBRAZILE: It's less than a quarter.\n\nDONALDSON: Come on, Stephen.\n\nTAPPER: We can have PolitiFact come in and weigh in on that one.\n\nBRAZILE: They will. Trust me.\n\nTAPPER: I do want -- I do want to move to the subject of the unemployed. And by the unemployed, I mean Shirley Sherrod, who is the most notable unemployed person in America right now. The White House says they had nothing to do with it, but Shirley Sherrod on CNN, after speaking to President Obama, said she wasn't so sure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I firmly believe that someone in the White House was telling them that the White House wanted me to resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Donna, the White House says, no, this was all Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's call. Do you believe that?\n\nBRAZILE: They've told me the same story, and...\n\nTAPPER: That's not what I asked you.\n\nBRAZILE: I know.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThey told me the same story, and I'm reluctant -- and I trust the source. My source said we had nothing to do with it, but, you know, once we got on top of it, we moved it.\n\nLook, Ms. Sherrod told a story that is just as amazing as the hymns from \"Amazing Grace.\" It was a story of redemption. And yet we all know from the facts that everyone, everyone -- there's enough pro (ph) to go around to ensure that everyone continue to eat bird until turkey season.\n\nBut the truth is, is that the White House jumped the gun, Fox News and others who allowed this -- this -- this bogus tape to hit the airwaves...\n\nROBERTS: NAACP.\n\nBRAZILE: ... and the NAACP...\n\nTAPPER: The NAACP, absolutely.\n\nBRAZILE: ... that did not call their local chapter, did not confer with Ms. Sherrod, it's a mind-boggling story. I talked to Ms. Sherrod. You know, when you grow up in the deep South, as I did, you know the -- you know the history of the movement and you know the history of the Sherrod family. You know Shirley Sherrod's personal story. I'm ashamed that so many people failed to even just simply Google her name.\n\nROBERTS: But the truth is, the only people who could fire her were the administration. Fox News couldn't fire her. The NAACP couldn't fire her. Only the administration could fire her. So they really bear the most culpability here, I think by a long shot.\n\nBut the other thing that's true is that what she actually did say gets us right back to the last conversation, because what she did say was that the divisions she came to understand were really not between black and white, but between haves and have-nots. And that is really what -- what turned her around and -- and made her fight for that white farmer.\n\nDONALDSON: But I think, except for her, there's enough blame to go around for everyone here. The people who maliciously and with intention misrepresented the facts, I mean, I -- I believe in the First Amendment. There's nothing you can do about them, although you wish for Joseph Welch to say as he did to Joe McCarthy when Joe McCarthy was destroying someone on television, have you no decency, at last?\n\nBut from the standpoint of Obama and the administration, who are these people that they should pay attention to and be afraid of? Who's Glenn Beck? I mean, who's Bill O'Reilly? Who's Brett whatever his name is?\n\nTAPPER: Andrew -- Andrew Breitbart...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: No, let me -- let me finish, because I want to give a little advice, since I've been doing it this morning in economics, to the president.\n\n(UNKNOWN): OK.\n\nDONALDSON: I want to quote another president who also said he had enemies, I'm going to -- of financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sexism. They are unanimous in their hatred for me, and I welcome their hatred, said Franklin Roosevelt, who said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\n\nSo, President Obama, don't be afraid of them. Take them on, and let the people judge. You may lose, but if you lose, you will lose grandly (ph).\n\nTAPPER: This is an argument you hear from a lot of liberal activists and Democratic activists. Josh Marshall, who writes at Talking Points Memo, wrote, speaking of Andrew Breitbart, who -- the blogger, the conservative blogger who originally posted this video, that -- the unfairly edited excerpt, which he says that's the -- that's the way he got it, was in that unfairly edited excerpt, and this is what Josh Marshall wrote.\n\n\"Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify. To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong.\"\n\nStephen, do you think that this -- that liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists or...\n\nHAYES: No, way. They would never do that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean, Donna's colleague, Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this. Senior vice president of news, Michael Clemente, sent out a memo talking about the need to treat this carefully, to gather all the facts.\n\nLook, it's an easy distraction. That's what they want to do. I understand that.\n\nThe basic point, to go back to what Donna said, involves the speech, and the speech was -- you know, for -- for most of the speech, a fantastic speech, a compelling speech, a moving speech. I mean, to hear the stories about Baker County, to hear about her upbringing, to hear about the men who burned crosses in her front yard, is a compelling story. It's incredibly moving.\n\nWhat happened then in the speech was that she slipped into what I think are easy accusations of racism that don't work. She said, in the -- in the middle of her speech...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: This is the speech in March, the March speech, yes.\n\nHAYES: ... the March speech, she talked about Republicans. It's always about money, she said. I haven't seen such mean-spirited people as I've seen lately over the issue of health care. Some of the racism we thought was buried, didn't it surface? Now we've endured eight years of the Bushes, and we didn't do some of the stuff these Republicans are doing because you have a black president.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Bill O'Reilly called for her to be fired. Isn't (ph) he on Fox...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: So did the White House. So did the USDA.\n\nROBERTS: But there was racism that came up during the health care debate, with the -- with the vilification of John Lewis at the Capitol. And -- and the truth is, is that -- you know, this is a conversation we -- we just don't have.\n\nI mean, I really think Eric Holder was right. We are cowardly about talking about race.\n\nI had a cross burned in my front yard, too, and I know what it was like to grow up in the South in those years. And -- and the truth is that the -- that the conversation is just different among whites and among blacks. It is. And we have to be able to address that if we're ever going to get past it as a nation.\n\nIf we have any opportunity to perfect this union, that's what we have to do.\n\nHAYES: I agree with you, but don't you think one of the reasons that we don't have this kind of conversation about race is because of the kind of comments branding Republicans as racists for opposing health care?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: This has -- this has nothing to do...\n\nDONALDSON: Mr. Beck called the president of the United States a racist. What about that?\n\nTAPPER: But is that racist, to say somebody's racist?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, he just said branding people as racists.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: What she was -- what she was saying -- I heard the speech in its entirety, and I went public when I heard the speech. What she was talking about was the political climate, a political climate that, yes, some in the Republican Party have condoned simply because they refuse to repudiate those elements within their party that simply have gone too far, with the birther notion, with his illegitimacy, and creating the kind of racial resentment that prohibits us from having a genuine conversation about race and racism.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, Shirley Sherrod on CNN also said something specifically about Andrew Breitbart from biggovernment.com, the conservative activist who posted the unfairly edited video, and here's what she had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I know I've gotten black versus white. He's probably the person who's never gotten past it and never attempted to get past it. I think he'd like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery. That's where I think he'd like to see all black people end up again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: This woman's been offered a job by the Agriculture Department as a deputy director of the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and she's saying Andrew Breitbart wants to return to the days of slavery.\n\nNow, you can think what Andrew Breitbart did was reprehensible, irresponsible, unfair, and a total smear. Did that justify saying he wants us to go back to the days of slavery?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, you know, I'm not going to -- to second-guess Ms. Sherrod. I know her history. But I am going to say that Mr. Breitbart should resign, even after -- not resign...\n\nROBERTS: From what?\n\nBRAZILE: Sorry, I misspoke. I'm not in the business of asking people to be fired. I've been fired once before. But I think Mr. Breitbart should apologize to her.\n\nI mean, she -- this is a woman who -- her father was murdered, and no one was ever brought to justice. I mean, she has some -- she has some anger that she was talking about, but she also talked about how she got -- you know, how she came to struggle with this and how she went on to -- to -- to start her life anew and fight for farmers of (inaudible)\n\nBut let me just say, going back to this conversation, can we have a conversation about race? Yes. But it cannot start here in Washington. It cannot start with politicians leading the conversation. It must start back in Georgia, where Ms. Sherrod and the Spooners can help lead us in this dialogue.\n\nAnd if Mr. Breitbart would like to be part of it, we welcome him to the conversation.\n\nROBERTS: But it's -- I disagree. I think it can start in Washington, and I think it can start in the White House. And I think that we -- that we have an opportunity -- everybody talks about this being a teachable moment. Well, let's learn and -- and let's have the president be the teacher in -- in chief. And, you know...\n\nDONALDSON: Yes. And Mitch McConnell was asked about an aspect of this, and he says, I don't want to get into that. All right. That's his privilege not to as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate. But it takes all the sides to get into it civilly, not calling names or calling people racists on either side -- you're quite correct -- and talk about it. But it's not going to happen, unfortunately.\n\nBRAZILE: But civil rights used to be a nonpartisan issue.\n\nROBERTS: That's right.\n\nBRAZILE: It wasn't black or white or left versus white. It was Republicans. I keep telling Republicans, it was Republicans who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... listen to the Johnson tapes, when Johnson was ready to sign the civil rights bill, it was, you know, dead of summer, and -- and he's saying to his aides, make sure that the Republicans are here. I'm not going to sign this without Ev Dirksen being in the room, because this is the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Well, Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader...\n\nROBERTS: ... they -- they had so much to do with it.\n\nDONALDSON: Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader of the Senate, made the last speech in favor of breaking the southern filibuster to pass the '64 Civil Rights Act. He quoted Victor Hugo. Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. That's the way the Republicans in the Senate acted.\n\nBRAZILE: But I hope Ms. Sherrod and Mr. Breitbart can sit down and have a -- whatever kind of summit.\n\n(UNKNOWN): A beer summit?\n\nBRAZILE: I don't know what she drinks.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... don't want to get into this.\n\nBRAZILE: But I know that they can find a common language to talk about the future if they can only sit and listen to each other.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, I want to ask you a question about -- Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times suggests that she should -- Shirley Sherrod should be offered a job in the White House. And she also writes this: \"The first black president should expand beyond his campaign security blanket, the smug cordon of overprotective white guys surrounding him. Otherwise, this administration will keep tripping over race, rather than inspiring on race. The president shouldn't give Sherrod her old job back. He should give here a new job, director of black outreach. This White House needs one.\"\n\nWhether or not the job should go to Shirley Sherrod, does this White House need one?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I would hope that the White House could bring in more people, people who understood history, people who could help serve this president. When they hear of a conversation like Ms. Sherrod, hopefully they won't run to the hilltop. They could sit down and say let's -- let's talk about this.\n\nI -- I know from having talked to Valerie Jarrett that she's deeply concerned and that she's working inside the White House to make sure that this never happens again.\n\nDONALDSON: But, Jake, it's not black outreach. Maureen, please, it's outreach on this issue for blacks and whites and people of all colors.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Of all colors.\n\nDONALDSON: To say, all right, we need someone for black outreach is the wrong direction.\n\nTAPPER: Stephen?\n\nHAYES: Well, yes, I mean, I don't think -- I think that Sam's right. I don't think that necessarily creating a new position of black outreach is -- is going to solve the country's problems on race. And certainly after looking at Ms. Sherrod, in spite of her history and the things that she said that were so moving, after seeing her comments about Andrew Breitbart wanting us to go back to slavery, would not be the ideal person for the job.\n\nTAPPER: Cokie, 30 seconds.\n\nROBERTS: Well, no, I think that the basic point that there has been an ignorance in some ways of -- of the immediate past history that some of us lived through of the young people in the White House is true and that -- and that there does need to be a better understanding of that in order to -- to just try to -- to salve the wounds.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Wonderful job, guys. Thank you so much. The roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com and on our new iPad app, where later you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up with PolitiFact to fact-check the show.",

    "text":"''I don't regret setting bombs,'' Bill Ayers said. ''I feel we didn't do enough.'' Mr. Ayers, who spent the 1970's as a fugitive in the Weather Underground, was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn-of-the-19th-century stone house in the Hyde Park district of Chicago. The long curly locks in his Wanted poster are shorn, though he wears earrings. He still has tattooed on his neck the rainbow-and-lightning Weathermen logo that appeared on letters taking responsibility for bombings. And he still has the ebullient, ingratiating manner, the apparently intense interest in other people, that made him a charismatic figure in the radical student movement.\n\nNow he has written a book, ''Fugitive Days'' (Beacon Press, September). Mr. Ayers, who is 56, calls it a memoir, somewhat coyly perhaps, since he also says some of it is fiction. He writes that he participated in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972. But Mr. Ayers also seems to want to have it both ways, taking responsibility for daring acts in his youth, then deflecting it.\n\n''Is this, then, the truth?,'' he writes. ''Not exactly. Although it feels entirely honest to me.''\n\nBut why would someone want to read a memoir parts of which are admittedly not true? Mr. Ayers was asked.\n\n''Obviously, the point is it's a reflection on memory,'' he answered. ''It's true as I remember it.''",

    "text":"We will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.\n\nThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.",

    "text":"Factsheets\n\nUpdated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails\n\nWe\u2019ve put all of the information about Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department emails here. Just the facts, all in one place.\n\nWhy did Clinton use her own email account?\n\nWhen Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.\n\nThat is the only reason she used her own account.\n\nHer usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.\n\nAs Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.\n\nWas it allowed?\n\nYes. The laws, regulations, and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.\n\nThe 2009 National Archives regulation in place during her tenure required that \"[a]gencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\" The regulation recognizes the use of non-government email accounts.\n\nAs she has stated, Clinton's practice was to email government officials on their \".gov\" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved. In fact, more than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State Department\u2019s email system before she provided them with paper copies.\n\nA Politifact analysis also confirmed that Clinton's practices complied with laws and regulations, including support from the former director of a prominent government accountability organization: \"In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.\"\n\nClinton said she did not use her email to send or receive classified information, but the State Department and two Inspectors General said some of these emails do contain classified information. Was her statement inaccurate?\n\nClinton only used her account for unclassified email. No information in Clinton's emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.\n\nWhen information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.\n\nAfter reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors General have proffered that a small number of emails, which did not contain any classified markings and\/or dissemination controls, should have been classified at the time they were sent. The State Department has said it disagrees with this assessment.\n\nClinton hopes the State Department and the agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are appropriate to share with the public.\n\nHow did Clinton receive and consume classified information?\n\nThe Secretary's office was located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by Clinton while in the office. While on travel, the State Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.\n\nA separate, closed email system was used by the State Department for the purpose of handling classified communications, which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system.\n\nIs Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email use?\n\nNo. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the IGs made a security referral. This was not criminal in nature as misreported by some in the press. The Department of Justice is now seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton\u2019s email account.\n\nIs it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned over to the government? Why?\n\nAgain, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.\n\nClinton hopes that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to share with the public, and that the release will be as timely and as transparent as possible.\n\nWhen the Department upgraded some of the previously unclassified email to classified, her team worked with the State Department to ensure copies of her emails were stored in a safe and secure manner. She also directed her team to give her server that hosted her email account while she was Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails that already had been provided to the State Department. Clinton has pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry.\n\nWould this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov email address?\n\nEven if Clinton's emails had been on a government email address and government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.\n\nWhile the State Department's review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to the Inspectors Generals' attentions, the emails that recently were upgraded to classified prior to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling classified communications.\n\nHave Clinton's State Department aides also been asked to provide the Department and Congress with emails from their personal accounts?\n\nWe understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.\n\nClinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, as they have committed - as she has - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.\n\nPress reports say she used multiple devices \u2013 a Blackberry and an iPad \u2013 is that true?\n\nClinton relied on her Blackberry for emailing. This was easiest for her. When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled. She also had access to her email account on her iPad and sometimes used it for that too.\n\nWas she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-\".gov\" email account?\n\nThe State Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records. To address these requirements, it was her practice to email government employees on their \".gov\" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.\n\nWhat did Clinton provide to the State Department?\n\nOn December 5, 2014, 30,490 copies of work or potentially work-related emails sent and received by Clinton from March 18, 2009, to February 1, 2013, were provided to the State Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. More than 90% of her work or potentially work-related emails provided to the Department were already in the State Department's record-keeping system because those e-mails were sent to or received by \"state.gov\" accounts.\n\nEarly in her term, Clinton continued using an att.blackberry.net account that she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the State Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.\n\nWhy did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?\n\nIn fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her initial weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.\n\nAt the time the printed copies were provided to the Department in 2014, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.\n\nWhy didn't Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014?\n\nIn 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department's obligations under the Federal Records Act.\n\nClinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton's practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State Department\u2019s email system.\n\nIn providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related\u2014including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting\u2014erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives' determination that over 1250 emails were \"personal\" records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).\n\nAfter providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else.\n\nWhy did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?\n\nThe State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the Department\u2019s requirements under the Federal Records Act.\n\nThe letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.\n\nWhile this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.\n\nWhy did Clinton decide not to keep her personal emails?\n\nAs Clinton has said before, these were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.\n\nDid Clinton delete any emails while facing a subpoena?\n\nNo. As noted, the emails that Clinton chose not to keep were personal emails\u2014they were not federal records or even work-related\u2014and therefore were not subject to any preservation obligation under the Federal Records Act or any request. Nor would they have been subject to the subpoena\u2014which did not exist at the time\u2014that was issued by the Benghazi Select Committee some three months later.\n\nRep. Gowdy's subpoena issued in March 2015 did not seek, and had nothing to do with, her personal, non-work emails nor her server nor the request by State Department last year for her help in their own record-keeping. Indeed in his March 19th letter, Rep. Gowdy expressly stated he was not seeking any emails that were \"purely personal in nature.\"\n\nIn March 2015, when Rep. Gowdy issued a subpoena to Clinton, the State Department had received all of Clinton's work-related emails in response to their 2014 request, and indeed, had already provided Clinton's relevant emails to Rep. Gowdy\u2019s committee.\n\nRep. Gowdy, other Republicans, and some members of the media have seized on a CNN interview with Clinton to question her on this point. Rep. Gowdy has even gone so far as to say Clinton is lying. But he and the others are clearly mistaken.\n\nAs Vox reported, \"[S]he didn't lie about the subpoena. \u2026 Clinton clearly wasn't responding to the question of whether she'd ever been subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee but whether she'd been subpoenaed before she wiped the emails from her server.\" Additionally, Factcheck.org said in its analysis, \"Clinton's denial came in response to a question about deleting emails 'while facing a subpoena,' and Clinton objected to Keilar's 'assumption.' Clinton\u2019s campaign said that the emails were deleted before she received the subpoena and that was the point Clinton was making.\" Politifact added, \"Suggesting that Clinton deleted emails while facing a subpoena contradicts what we know about the controversy so far.\"\n\nVox went on to further decry Rep. Gowdy's reaction, saying, \"[T]his one's a particularly absurd gimmick, even for a committee that is selectively leaking from depositions and documents to justify its existence. If there was a more extreme category of dissembling than 'pants on fire,' now would be the time for Politifact to roll it out on the House Republicans.\"\n\nWhy was the State Department given printed copies?\n\nThat is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual (the Department's policy manual) require that \"until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of email messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records.\" [5 FAM 443.3].\n\nWere any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?\n\nNo.\n\nHow many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the State Department?\n\nHer email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.\n\nHow and who decided what should be provided to the State Department?\n\nThe Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance \"designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials.\" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].\n\nFollowing conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.\n\nA search was conducted on Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.\n\nAfter this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a \".gov\" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the State Department.\n\nTo help identify any potential non-\".gov\" correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.\n\nNext, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.\n\nLastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: \"Benghazi\" and \"Libya.\"\n\nThese additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the State Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real-time.\n\nWith respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the State Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the State Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nGiven Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the State Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Clinton in August 2014 \u2013 prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.\n\nThe review process described above confirmed Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Clinton provided to the State Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the State Department's record-keeping system in real time.\n\nDid Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?\n\nDuring her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.\n\nDid she withhold any work emails? What about the 15 emails that Sid Blumenthal provided to the Select Committee that she did not provide to the State Department?\n\nShe provided the State Department with all work and potentially work-related emails that she had, including all of her correspondence with Sid Blumenthal. We understand that Mr. Blumenthal had some emails that Clinton did not have, and Clinton had some emails that Mr. Blumenthal did not have, but it is important to note that none of those emails provide any new insights on the attack on our facilities in Benghazi.\n\nDo you think a third party should have been allowed to review what was turned over to the State Department, as well as the remainder that was not?\n\nThe Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance \"designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials.\" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].\n\nClinton responded to the State Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work and potentially work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure.\n\nAfter her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral service, family vacations, etc.\n\nGovernment officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.\n\nCan't she release the emails she provided to the State Department herself?\n\nBecause the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the State Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She called for them to be made available as soon as possible, and is glad to see the Department has begun releasing them.\n\nSome of the emails released show Clinton emailed aides at times on their personal, rather than .gov accounts. Was she trying to hide these communications?\n\nAs Clinton has said before, it was her practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts if it was work-related. This is evidenced in the emails released so far. In reviewing her emails in 2014, there was a fraction of emails with work-related information sent to U.S. government officials\u2019 personal accounts, and those were provided to the State Department. The overwhelming majority of her work-related emails were to .gov accounts.\n\nWhere was the server for her email located?\n\nThe server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.\n\nWhat level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider?\n\nThe security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity about the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. Suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.\n\nWas the server ever hacked?\n\nNo, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.\n\nWas there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as \"Guccifer\" hacked Sid Blumenthal\u2019s account?\n\nWhile this was not a breach of Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications, including changing her email address.\n\nWas the State Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?\n\nYes. As the Select Committee has said, the State Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the State Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the State Department received the printed copies.\n\nFor example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Clinton on September 12, 2012, was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the State Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.\n\nThis example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-\".gov\" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of State Department officials, it was Clinton\u2019s practice to forward it to officials at their \"state.gov\" address; and 2) the State Department was able to search and produce Clinton\u2019s emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts.",

    "text":"Transcript: NPR's Full Interview With Sen. Marco Rubio\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is running for president and spoke with NPR's Steve Inskeep on Monday ahead of his big announcement.\n\nRubio talked about how he hopes to stand out in the 2016 presidential field, Indiana's religious freedom law, the president's deal with Iran, immigration policy, and America's warming relationship with Cuba.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP: In all the years I've been interviewing people, I don't think I've spoken with somebody on the day of an announcement like this. And I was thinking that if it were me, there might be a moment the night before where I was lying awake wondering if I was really ready for this. Did you have a moment of wondering if you were really ready for this?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: Not last night, but, I mean, if you reach the point where you're wondering it the night before you announce, then you probably shouldn't run. I think anyone who's thinking about the highest office in the most powerful nation on earth has to spend some time analyzing whether they're prepared for the job. And look, I think the job is perhaps the most difficult job in politics anywhere in the world. You're the leader of the most powerful military on the planet. You make decisions that have global implications. And it's happening at a time when the country's going through an extraordinary economic transformation that is leaving many people insecure. But from all that and given both my experience at the local, state and federal level, and especially the lessons learned over the last five years as I've been engaged in federal policy making, I'm very confident that I have the judgment and the knowledge that I need to do a very good job as president of the United States. And clearly, as you see the history of the presidency, people who go into that office grow, the office helps you grow as well as you go through it and that's, having the ability to learn is a big part of the office as well. But I'm certainly capable from day 1. I'm very confident that I have the capability from day no. 1 to lead this country.\n\nAre you also affirming that you are not giving up your \u2014 are you also affirming that you are not running for Senate?\n\nI am not. And the reason I think strongly about that is, if you've decided that you want to serve this country as its president, that's what you should be running for. And I find myself in a situation where my Senate seat comes up for re-election at the exact same time as the presidency. And by Florida law, you can't run for both, anyway. But to even be thinking about a Plan B in case this doesn't work, I think diminishes your ability to succeed on the campaign because your mind will always be on, if this doesn't work, then I can do something else. And the truth is that, you know, I don't want to be in politics my entire life. And I'm prepared to serve this country now in its highest office and I'm excited about this opportunity.\n\nYou'll be in a crowded Republican field. How do you expect to distinguish yourself from your opponents on the Republican side?\n\nWell, I expect that I'm going to go out and tell people my vision for the future of this country. I'm going to be very specific and detailed about our plans and how we're going to get there. In fact, I've done that already. We have a very detailed policy position that we've outlined on numerous issues over the last two years, culminating in my book that just came out earlier this year, American Dreams. And I think from that, voters are going to analyze the different position of the candidates, their capabilities, their history, but more importantly their view of the future and their plans to get us there and I'm very confident that that will lead to success.\n\nIs there a sentence that people can have in their heads? Marco Rubio is different from the others because...\n\nHe has the clear view of how the 21st century can also be an American century.\n\nWe're in a moment where you have put out plans proposing to reshape the way the federal government deals with federal assistance to the poor.\n\nYes.\n\nWe're in a moment where Jeb Bush, who may also run, has a superPAC called Right to Rise. And this week, of course, Hillary Clinton declared her campaign for the presidency talking about helping everyday people. What's going on there?\n\nWell, that's a good thing for our country because equality of opportunity has always defined us as a people and as a nation. And the fact that there are millions of people now in America that are starting to have significant doubts about whether we're still that kind of country should be deeply concerning to us. Our identity is at stake. Every country in the world has rich people. What makes America different is, we've had millions and millions of people who through hard work and perseverance are able to achieve happiness and upward mobility. And the fact that that's in danger and in question is deeply concerning, and should be. It threatens our identity. So I'm glad that people are talking about it. Ultimately, talking about it won't be enough. You have to have plans that work to help us address it. And for me it begins by embracing and acknowledging the reality that we are living through a massive transformation into this post-industrial 21st century economy that is both disruptive but also exciting. It comes not just with challenges, but also with opportunities. But we can only embrace those opportunities if we move forward on thinking about the changes we're going to have to make in order to fully enter the 21st century.\n\nWhat's one way that your approach would be different from Jeb Bush's or Hillary Clinton's?\n\nWell, as far as the Republican field is concerned, there will be plenty of time for comparison shopping. The truth is, for voters, the truth is that at this moment most of my opponents in the field beyond talking about upward mobility have not clearly outlined what they would do. We have a clear policy outline on each of these issues that people can read about. And if, you know, all of my opponents and other candidates in the Republican field choose to adopt some of those ideas, I'll consider that a victory as well as flattery. But on the Democratic side, I think, you know, Hillary Clinton is someone who's deeply wedded to the institutions of the 20th century. Her plans are to spend more money on the existing higher education system. That system doesn't work any more. It doesn't work any more because we don't graduate enough young people from high school ready to work. We need to do more of that \u2014 ready to work in trades as mechanics, airplane technicians and plumbers and engineers. These are good \u2014 welders. These are good 21st century jobs and we are capable of teaching people how to do that so at 18, 19 years of age, they can be employed. We also need to have more flexible, more flexibility in higher education for working Americans who can't afford to drop everything and go to school full-time for four years. We need to have programs that allow someone who works full time to learn at their own pace, on their own time, so that a receptionist can become a paralegal, so that the home-health aide making $10 an hour can become a dental hygienist making $55,000 a year. And then we have to have more quality measures in higher education. For example, before you take out a student loan--\n\nMhmm\n\nI have a bill that says every student, before you take out a student loan, needs to be told how much you can expect to make when you graduate from that school with the degree you're pursuing so you can make an informed decision about whether or not it's worth it to borrow a bunch of money for that degree.\n\nA Florida political reporter noticed that you spent a plane ride sitting beside Jeb Bush, more than two hours, coming back from an NRA convention. Did you guys talk about the presidential campaign at all?\n\nNot in great detail. Jeb and I are friends, we'll always be friends. And I have tremendous admiration for him as a person, what he did as governor, and personal affection. And that's not going to change. I don't view, I'm not running against Jeb Bush and I'm not running against anybody in this field. I'm running because I strongly believe that I have something to offer this country that no one else in the field does at this moment in our history. And I'm going to go out there and do the best job that I can and \u2014 but, I mean, that's not going to impact our relationship in any way that's going to change how we feel about one another and it was great to see him and spend quality time just talking about good times and everything going on ...\n\nYou didn't talk politics very much at all?\n\n... and everything in between. Sure, I mean we had observations about \u2014 we joked with a lot of the passengers who saw us sitting next to each other and we took some pictures with people and we told them, we warned them how historic a picture like that may be one day. And, um, but you know, we talked about the Masters, we talked about the Paleo diet, we talked about the Miami Dolphins. I mean it, we talked about, reminisced about old war stories from our time in the legislature, when I was in the legislature and he was governor. It was just a host of things.\n\nSooner or later if you go forward and he goes forward, there's going to be a moment where you're going to have to say, \"Here's why it should be me and not him.\"\n\nI don't know. I mean, I think this year's going to be quite different in that regard. We have a quality field of candidates who are going to be well financed and experienced, who are going to be running. And I think that'll change the nature of the race. There'll certainly be moments when others will try to draw distinctions. But in my mind, I'm going to talk about who I am and what I want to do. And I'll let voters make the decision about who they think is best capable at this moment of leading our country.\n\nYou scheduled an announcement at Miami's Freedom Tower, which has historic significance because Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's regime in the 60s and 70s received federal aid there. This brings to mind that you have strongly criticized President Obama's restoration of relations with Cuba. If you're elected, would you reverse that policy?\n\nAbsolutely, and I think the reason why is because I'm interested in, my interest in Cuba is freedom and democracy. I think the Cuban people, they are free, have the right to choose any economic model they want to follow. I don't believe these changes will actually further democracy. In fact, I think they will make it harder to achieve. The goal of the Castro regime is to create the impression and the reality that their form of government is a legitimate form of government and set it in concrete. They know they have a generational challenge. Most of their top leaders are in their 80s. The actuarial tables tell you they don't have much longer. And they want to leave in place global recognition for this form of government so that it can continue in perpetuity. And that means the Cuban people will never have the chance to experience what the people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti have, what the people in Mexico have, what the people in Peru have, what the people in Colombia have, which is free and fair elections. And that's all I want for the people in Cuba. And I think U.S. policy towards Cuba is a major leverage point that we can use to help the Cuban people achieve freedom for themselves.\n\nBut help me think through this. The president made this announcement, they're working on getting an embassy going at some point in the future. He went to Summit of the Americas where other countries in Latin America very much welcomed the restoration of relations. You're saying that if you're elected, you would close that embassy, you would break diplomatic ties, you would go back to the way things were?\n\nWe have an interest section in Cuba and it will continue to operate, but an embassy, I'm not, I don't believe this country should be diplomatically recognizing a nation of the nature of Cuba. Obviously there are other dictatorships in the world that we have relations with by geopolitical reality. You know, China's the largest country in the world, the second largest economy, the second largest military force. There are geopolitical realities there. Cuba is a brutal, tyrannical dictatorship 90 miles from the shore of our country. It is a nation that helps North Korea evade U.N. weapon sanctions. It is a country that harbors fugitives from American justice, including Medicare fraudsters and someone who killed a police officer in the United States. And I just think that we should have continued with the policy and perhaps looked for new ways of \u2014 continue with the policy of not recognizing that regime and not allowing them access to economic growth that would allow them to perpetuate themselves in power, and continue to search for ways to provide the Cuban people with more information about the reality of the world so they would be empowered to eventually create for themselves a democratic society.\n\nYou've also said that you would reverse the president's deal with Iran, assuming that that is finalized. You said you would absolutely do that. What would that look like on day one?\n\nWell, I would not adhere \u2014 well, we have to understand the deal, basically, can be what it is on paper. What the president is banking on is that he's going to use a national security waiver to lift the sanctions on Iran, the economic sanctions that now exist. And we would simply re-impose the sanctions. And I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable. The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things. This issue of them asking for immediate relief of sanctions the minute the deal is signed is going to be a deal breaker. I hope it would be a deal break for this administration. And at the end of the day, we need to recognize that what Iran is trying to do here, and this is clear to anyone who has inside knowledge into this or has followed it closely, Iran is trying to maintain all the infrastructure they need to be nuclear capable without agreeing to any irreversible concessions. And that seems to be what they have achieved, if in fact this moves forward. So in my mind, we would just reinstitute the sanctions.\n\nBut I'm just thinking this through. The deal is made. It's made not just with the United States, but with the European allies. Would you move forward with re-imposing sanctions even if the Europeans don't go along with it?\n\nYes, it wouldn't be as effective, obviously. We would, ultimately, I think, the Europeans are going to have a test anyway because the Iranians are going to violate the sanctions at some point. They're going to evade it either by trying to take advantage of loopholes in the deal, or they'll just flat out evade it because they've always had a secret component to their, to their program. And at that point, they're going to have a huge test on their hands, which is, are they willing to live by the agreement that they even signed on to? But from the United States' perspective, while we want our allies to join us in this endeavor, and certainly sanctions against Iran would be more effective were they in conjunction with our allies around the world, we have to look out for our own national security concerns. And in my mind, if the president wanted this to be a permanent deal that survived his presidency, he would have brought it to Congress.\n\nI'm just thinking through further, though, as part of this deal, assuming it's finalized, the Iranians get rid of a vast amount of enriched uranium, almost all they have. They limit the amount of enrichment that they will have. They limit the number of centrifuges they will operate and they will allow inspections for decades, actually. So you would say, all that, forget about it, it's done.\n\nThey would retain all the infrastructure, first of all, they ...\n\nThey retain infrastructure, sure.\n\nThey retain not only just infrastructure, they retain centrifuges, too. They may not be spinning them, but they will retain them in their possession. They continue to develop their long range missile capabilities, which are unstopped. There's no prohibition on them acquiring a weapon design as they probably, may even already have. They continue to sponsor terrorism all over the world. In fact, now they'll have more funding to pay for it, in places they already control, places like Beirut. They're increasingly active in Yemen. Their hand and their role's clear in Bahrain and in a growing number of places around the world. And they continue to be run by a radical Shia cleric who has apocalyptic views of the future and of their role in it. So none of these things change. Their infrastructure will remain in place and at some point, they could follow the North Korean model very easily, which is they can cook up an excuse for why they need to have a weapon program and move forward on it.\n\nIs war inevitable then?\n\nI hope not. My hope is that we can delay a program long enough and you would hope that there would be some sort of change in leadership in Iran that would at least allow them to decide that they would rather have an economy than have a weapon. You can't guarantee it. But at the end of the day no one wants war, but I actually think that this deal could advance the prospects of war. I think this deal and the fact that Iran will retain nuclear infrastructure increases the likelihood that one of their neighbors may take action against them, whether it's Israel or the Saudis or someone else. It also increases the likelihood now, that Iran becomes even more aggressive in its proxy wars that it's conducting all over the world. It also increases the likelihood that they'll increase their conventional capabilities threatening our U.S. presence in the region. And ultimately I think it almost guarantees an arms race in the region, because the Saudis have made very clear, and others, the Egyptians as well, that whatever Iran has, they'll get as well. So if Iran is allowed to enrich to a certain level, they will begin doing the same, requiring a capability to do the same.\n\nLet me ask about a domestic issue. In recent weeks, the state of Indiana passed a Religious Freedom law, which was interpreted by many as discrimination, by others, as protection for people who don't want to take part in gay marriage. You defended the law and spoke about the hypothetical example of a florist who was asked to participate in a gay marriage and wanted to refuse. You said that person should have the right to follow their religious beliefs. Indiana, though, has since changed the law. Do you still support that concept?\n\nWell, to be fair, I haven't read the change in detail to give you an opinion on it specifically, but I'll tell you where I stand. I don't believe you can discriminate against people. So I don't believe it's right for a florist to say, I'm not going to provide you flowers because you're gay. I think there's a difference between not providing services to a person because of their identity, who they are or who they love, and saying, I'm not going to participate in an event, a same-sex wedding, because that violates my religious beliefs. There's a distinction between those two things. So, certainly, you can't not \u2014 it's immoral and wrong to say, I'm not going to allow someone who's gay or lesbian to use my restaurant, stay in my hotel, or provide photography service to them because they're gay. The difference here is, we're not talking about discriminating against a person because of who they are, we're talking about someone who's saying \u2014 what I'm talking about, anyway, is someone who's saying, I just don't want to participate as a vendor for an event, a specific event that violates the tenets of my faith.\n\nWhat if two gay people get married and then they go that night to a hotel. Can the hotelkeeper refuse service to them?\n\nThat's not part of an event. Again, I mean, that's, there's a difference between saying, we're not going to allow you to stay in our hotel, common lodging establishment where people have a right to shelter, food, medical care, and saying we're not going to, what we're not going to do is provide services to an event, to an actual event, which is the wedding itself. And I think that's the distinction point that people have been pointing to, and, because mainstream Christianity teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman. People feel very strongly about that. And to ask someone to individually provide services to something of that nature, I think violates their religious liberty.\n\nThere's a big question lurking here, which is that most Americans, according to surveys, now support gay marriage. A large minority of Americans still oppose gay marriage. The question is, that people seem to be wrestling with, is, what ground do opponents of gay marriage have left to stand on? What ground should they have to stand on?\n\nFirst of all, if the majority of Americans support gay marriage, then you'll see it reflected in changes in state law, which has always regulated marriage. And so at the end of the day, if a majority of people in any given state in this country petition their legislature to change the definition of marriage to include the marriage of two people of the same sex, that'll be the law of the land. And that is what it is. Separate from that, there's a constitutional protection of religious liberty that allows people to live by the tenets of their faith both in their public and in private life. That doesn't mean that you're allowed to go in and disrupt a gay wedding. But by the same token, it doesn't mean that someone's allowed to come to you and force you to be a participant in a ceremony that violates the tenets of your faith. And to be honest, in the real world, 99.9% of the time, a same-sex couple doesn't want a florist or a photographer at their wedding that doesn't agree with the choice that they've made. So we're really talking about an issue that in large part is really not going to manifest itself in daily life, but in the instances that it does, there are individuals that don't want to be compelled by force of law to participate in an event that puts them in the position of violating their religious faith. There's a difference between that and discriminating against an individual because of who they are.\n\nAre there are other specific situations on your mind where you feel that people who are opposed to gay marriage would need some kind of protection from, from it?\n\nWell, I mean, that's the one that's in the news today. Again, I don't, we can always sit here and engage in hypotheticals, this, that, and the other, but at the end of the day, I mean, that's the one that's emerged because there's real cases behind people being fined for not providing services to a, to a ceremony as opposed to individuals.\n\nWhen we spoke last year, we talked about immigration, an issue on which you worked for a time on an immigration reform bill. You said, first, the reason to do that is not political, it's substantive. But, second, that there would be a political effect. That if the Republican Party deals with immigration, it would then have an opportunity to talk with Latino voters about other issues. And, of course, this is a voter group where Republicans have done very poorly in recent elections. Immigration hasn't been dealt with. What are the likely consequences for the Republican party in 2016?\n\nWell, again, every candidate has a different position on where they stand on the issue. From my perspective, I continue to believe it's an issue we need to address. The only point I've made is that I think the lessons of the last couple of years, for me, is that we're not going to be able to deal with it in one big piece of legislation. I still think we need to do immigration reform. I just don't think you can do it in a comprehensive, massive piece of legislation, given the lack of trust that there is today in the federal government. I honestly believe that the key to moving forward on immigration is to first and foremost prove to the American people that we are going to bring future illegal immigration under control \u2014 that if we legalize 12 million people, they won't be replaced by 12 million more who are here illegally. And I honestly believe, given my experiences on this issue now, that if we did that, the American people and the majority of Republicans and conservatives will be very reasonable and, and responsible about how we address the reality that we have 12 million human beings living in this country illegally.\n\nBut we're in a circumstance, granted there's still time, but we're in a circumstance where it doesn't look like immigration legislation is going to get through Congress before 2016. What does that mean for your party?\n\nAnd I think, I think it's nearly \u2013 well, I just outlined to you what I think the key is to moving forward. And I think that's impossible as long as Barack Obama's president now, because on two instances, particularly very recently, last year, he issued an executive order ordering federal agencies not to enforce immigration law. So if I'm telling you that the key to moving forward is the enforcement of immigration law, then that says the notion that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, and you have a president that's ordering agencies not to enforce immigration law, our ability to convince people, no matter what we pass, that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, as long as Barack Obama's president, is nil.\n\nHow do you keep from getting hammered on that in a general election where the Hispanic vote may be very important?\n\nWell, I don't know about the others, but I've done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that's more than she's ever done. She's given speeches on it, but she's never done anything on it. So I have a record of trying to do something on it. It didn't work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration and I warned about that throughout that process, as well, that I didn't think we were doing enough to give that bill a chance of moving forward in the House.\n\nDoes your biography help?\n\nI think biography's part of all of our lives, all of our candidacies, because it certainly influences how you view the country and how you view issues. I have a personal attachment to the working class because it's where I come from, it's still the neighborhood I live in, it's the people my children go to school with, it's the community that I'm involved in. And, but I also happen to think it's the identity of our country. And every candidate, you know, will bring to bear their experiences in life and how it's guided them and influenced their thinking, but from my perspective, I think it matters simply because it informs me on my policy decisions.\n\nThere's a big question here, also, because the Republican party, as many people have noted, faces a demographic challenge that gets a little worse with every election cycle. Growing groups in society, such as Latinos and others, are voting increasingly Democratic, and Republican voter groups, particularly older white voters, are getting smaller. What's the Republican Party need to do about that?\n\nWell, at the end, I don't think people go to the ballot box and say, I'm a Latino, therefore I'm voting Democrat. I think they bring with them their hopes and fears about the future, and they vote for whoever they think best understands them. And the challenge the Republican Party has had is unfairly, but it's the reality, they've been portrayed as a party that doesn't care about people who are trying to make it. A disproportionate number of people who are trying to make it, who are working class, who are out there working for a living at $18 an hour, $15 an hour, happen to also be people from minority communities. And if you think someone doesn't care or understand people like you, no matter what your policies are, it's going to be difficult to get them to listen to you, much less vote for you. And so I hope the Republican Party can become the champion of the working class because I think our policy proposals of limited government and free enterprise are better for the people who are trying to make it than big government is. The fact is that big government helps the people who have made it. If you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, you'll benefit. And so that's why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning. And everybody else is stuck and being left behind.\n\nSo you're beginning this gigantic game of Survivor with who knows how many other candidates. You're smiling as I say that. With who knows how many other candidates, what will determine who survives ultimately and how will you make sure it's you?\n\nWell, there are basics about any campaign. Obviously you'll have to put time into it, you'll have to be able to raise sufficient funds to communicate your message. And on a daily basis, you have to make sure you do the best you can to help convince people in a crowded field that you're the best person at this time for the job that you seek. But beyond it, I really think the key is, who can inspire our country into believing that the future doesn't have to be worse than our past, that the 21st century can be better than the 20th. And then once you've inspired them to believe that, showing them how we can accomplish it. And I feel very confident in our ability to do it and I think that's why we're going to win.\n\nShould I think of this as an insurgent campaign, because you don't have the resources of Jeb Bush, particularly?\n\nWell, I think our resources will be sufficient to do the job we're trying to do. At the end of the day, this is not a fundraising competition in and of itself. You also have to have a message and a messenger and a policy outline that proves to people that, that your campaign is better for them than what someone else is offering. But I'm certainly not the frontrunner and \u2014 but that's O.K. The election isn't tomorrow.\n\nWhat are you doing to make sure you don't run out of money?\n\n(Laughs) We're going to, we, we're trying to raise as much money as we can and that's important. As long as the media outlets keep charging us for advertising, we'll have to keep raising money.\n\nSenator Rubio, thanks very much.\n\nThank you.",

Joining me now, the president's top budget adviser Jack Lew . Welcome to MEET THE PRESS .\n\nMR. JACK LEW: Good to be here, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Good to have you here. So what is the latest? Have there been substantive talks over the course of the weekend?\n\nMR. LEW: Well, the latest is that, after the meeting on Thursday, there've been a lot of conversations within each of the party caucuses, within the House and the Senate , phone calls and conversations back and forth. That's how the president left it on Thursday, that we'd kind of put all of the items on the table. It was now a question of Congress figuring out what it could do. So I think that will continue over the next day or so.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But you don't have, as we sit here now, a, a better sense of what Congress is willing and able to do.\n\nMR. LEW: I think that what is encouraging is that the leaders in Congress seem to all agree that we can't push to a default , that we need to have a path that makes sure that the United States can keep its obligations and pay its bills in August . So I think that there are many conversations going on in order to make sure that that doesn't happen.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, let me be clear . Is the president's position that he would accept no more than $1 trillion in cuts if there's no tax increases ? Is that the number that he's sort of dealing with in his head?\n\nMR. LEW: I, I think, I think it's a little less mechanical than that. The president made clear he wants the largest deal possible. He wants to do the most we can to reduce the deficit . That would be the right thing to do for the American people . He made it clear he's willing to go into areas that he's not in the past been comfortable going into, and others will have to do that as well.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But he used that figure.\n\nMR. LEW: But he also said that if we can't get the most done, then in addition to extending the debt we should do as much as we can. There are a number of ways to get there. We aspire to, we aspire to more than -- yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But -- sure, but, but my question is the number. A -- if you get beyond $1 trillion and he still can't get any tax increases , the president said, \"I'm not willing to sign something that, that cuts more spending without having tax increases .\"\n\nMR. LEW: Well, what, what, what the president said was to do major structural changes on the spending side, there would have to be tax increases . And I think that one can see a path to getting well over $1 trillion on things that we should be able to agree to.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm. So if that's something of a fallback plan, because the president wanted something on the order of $4 trillion over 10 years of spending cuts, Erskine Bowles told my colleague Chuck Todd on his program, \"The Daily Rundown,\" that that might fall well short of what's necessary here. This is what he said.\n\nMR. ERSKINE BOWLES: The problem is, Chuck , that so many people are talking about doing it with just about $2 trillion of deficit reduction . That's not a solution. That's not going to fool our creditors.\n\nMR. GREGORY: In other words, the markets, our creditors are going to look at that and say that's not a fallback position, that's well short of what the United States should be doing.\n\nMR. LEW: I think if you look at what the markets are saying, they're saying two things. They're first saying the United States cannot default . And I think that is the bare minimum. And I say that again only because it has to be clear that there's some extreme views in some places that think that that's something we can do. We can't. The second is we need to get our fiscal house in order. I think that we've said for some time now, as have most, that we need to do on the order of $4 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10, 12 years. We would like to get that done now. If that can't happen, if there's not a willingness to come together, the president has shown he's willing to make the kinds of, of moves that are necessary to get there. But if there's not a similar willingness, we should do as much as we can now. I think that the markets will understand moving far -- as far as we can. What will be hard to explain is doing nothing.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You talk about the perils of default -- as has the, the Fed chief and the president and others -- as a given. And yet look at the polling on this, even among people who are paying close attention in the Gallup poll , 53 percent are in favor of voting against raising the debt ceiling . Do you think that's because there are Republicans like Michele Bachmann and others saying that this administration is really selling, in her words, a \"misnomer\" that, that we're headed toward default ? Where does that come from? Do you think they actually believe that, or you think they're doing that cynically?\n\nMR. LEW: I can't explain what motivates people to say, say those things. I can tell you the facts are the facts. If we don't raise the debt ceiling , we won't be able to pay our bills in August . And that has dire consequences. It will, for the first time , mean the United States cannot keep its obligations. It will cascade through the economy . It will mean that people, regular people who are buying homes and, and, and cars will pay higher interest rates . It means that we will put a cloud over the United States that might not go away anytime soon.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Final question. You say this is a question of will, political will. It's also a question of political leadership . This president said back in 2009 , economy , job one, his responsibility. Here's what he said.\n\nPRES. OBAMA: Now, my administration has a job to do as well, and that job is to get this economy back on its feet. That's my job. And it's a job I gladly accept. I love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then suddenly say, \"Well, this is Obama 's economy .\" That's fine. Give it to me .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Is it the president's failed leadership that has brought us to this moment? Does he bear responsibility?\n\nMR. LEW: I think the president's shown enormous leadership from the first day in office. He inherited an economy where the bottom was falling out. He stabilized it through dramatic actions without which millions of Americans would be looking for work who are working today. We still have a lot of work to do . The economy is not growing fast enough. We've made a lot of proposals. We want Congress to act on things like trade agreements and patent reform , things that are up there on the Hill right now which would help the economy . We think that it's important to extend the payroll tax and unemployment insurance . And we want to work together on things like infrastructure and other things that are necessary for the future. There's a lot of work to be done, but the president's leadership ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Mr. Lew , that's, that's a programmed answer. I mean, the reality is he said, \"My job is to get the economy back on its feet. That's my job.\" The reality is it's not, and this budget deal has fallen apart. The president's trying to lead, but he's not accomplishing it.\n\nMR. LEW: Well, I, I think that if you look at where the parties are compared to discussions over the last decades, there are things that both sides are talking about doing that are very dramatic. I think we -- there's still time to get something big done. The president has made it clear he wants to do something substantial. You know, when you look in the past at agreements between divided government , it's taken leadership on both sides . It took Reagan and O'Neill ; it took Clinton and Gingrich . The president is out there, he's willing to do it. He said it in the State of the Union , he said it in the budget . The question is, do we have a partner to work with? And I hope the answer to that is yes.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But you suspect it may not be yes.\n\nMR. LEW: Leadership requires a partner.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, Mr. Lew , thank you very much .\n\nMR. LEW: Pleasure to be here.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Appreciate your time. And the conversation continues now. Joining me, Assistant Majority Leader of the Senate , Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois , and Republican senator from South Carolina , author of \"The\n\nGreat American Awakening: Two Years That Changed America , Washington and Me,\" Senator Jim DeMint . Welcome both.\n\nSEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): Thank you.\n\nSEN. JIM DeMINT (R-SC): Good morning, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Tim Geithner , the Treasury secretary, was here last Sunday. I asked him about this ongoing deliberation, and he was emphatic about the outcome. This is what he said.\n\nSEC'Y TIM GEITHNER: Let me make this clear , David . The United States is not going to default . We are a country that pays its bills. We're going to meet our obligations. And the leadership in Congress , Republicans and Democrats , House and Senate , understand that. ... There's no alternative for Congress to act by the 2nd, and they recognize it, and I'm very confident they're going to do that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator DeMint , is he right, no alternative but to raise the debt ceiling ?\n\nSEN. DeMINT: Well, he's probably right on that. But there's only one plan in Congress right now to do it in a way that the credit agencies say won't turn us towards a negative rating. And that's the cut cap and balance plan in the House that gives the president the increase in the debt limit, but it does with those credible, long-term deficit reduction measures that both Moody's and S&P; have said we have to do or they will lower or credit rating .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, what, what is in that? Be specific about what that would do.\n\nSEN. DeMINT: Well, it does -- the three things that we have to do: We cut spending significantly, but reasonably in this budget year; we cap spending over the next 10 years to bring us towards a balance ; but probably most importantly and to have any kind of permanent reform , we send to the States a constitutional amendment that would force Congress to balance the budget . Let's let the states and the American people decide. It wouldn't happen until about 10 years out, but it gives us time to fix our tax code , to fix Social Security and Medicare .\n\nMR. GREGORY: It...\n\nSEN. DeMINT: And that's what we have to do.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator Durbin , there aren't votes for what Senator DeMint is talking about. That's just a legislative reality . However, and the president made the point, look, you don't need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget , for us to do our job. But is he wrong? Maybe you do need something to force you guys to do your job because it's not being done now.\n\nSEN. DURBIN: Let me just tell you about the constitutional amendment . It does not have the votes in the Senate . I don't know about the House of Representatives . And this notion that we somehow have to change the Constitution to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong. Bottom line is, those who want to push a balanced budget amendment are saying, \"I can't promise you that I won't steal again, but I will vote for the Ten Commandments .\" That isn't a good, solid approach. I've sat through a year and a half dealing with this whole deficit crisis , both with the Bowles - Simpson Commission and the Gang of Five, bipartisan efforts, both, and I can tell you the president has put on the table a reasonable list of alternatives that can bring us to $4 trillion in deficit reduction , and we don't have to wait for the states to ratify a constitutional amendment . Let's get our job done now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator DeMint , what's going on here? I mean, so many people I talk to are, frankly, disgusted with Washington . You know, you have on the one side people saying that, that Republicans are, are just crazy, that they won't negotiate, that they're being unreasonable, that they're denying the prospect of a default . Michele Bachmann saying it's a misnomer when the Fed chief says it would be economic calamity. And on the other side , you've, you know, you've got Republicans saying, \"Look, somebody's got to draw a line in the sand here. It's the Democrats who have run up the debt since President Obama got into office.\" But the reality is, nobody is really willing to compromise and to make a deal.\n\nSEN. DeMINT: Well, David , we certainly are willing to compromise. We're willing to give the president an increase in the debt limit, and you'll see the House pass that bill this, this week. But Senator Durbin and 20 other Democrats in the Senate are on record supporting a balanced budget amendment . And that is a place that we have to get to. But we need to realize, setting all politics aside, that our country is on course for a financial disaster. We can't take another $10 trillion in debt that the president has proposed. So it is absurd to say that we cannot agree that sometime in the next decade that we have to stop spending more than we're bringing in. You'll see in the next week, Republicans are more than willing to work with the president.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But...\n\nSEN. DeMINT: The only proposal that the president has sent to Congress , David , is a budget that increases the debt another $10 trillion .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. But, Senator DeMint , let's be realistic.\n\nSEN. DeMINT: Now the...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Bottom line here, if a balanced budget amendment is not passed, which it -- you've heard Senator Durbin say is not going to be passed -- will Republicans still vote to raise the debt ceiling ? And if not, are you prepared for the consequences on this economy and for the country ?\n\nSEN. DeMINT: Well, I hope the president won't take us through that. And I hope Senator DeMint won't. But we've got to draw a line in the, in the sand now because a day of reckoning is going to come and the longer we put it off, the bigger the problems are going to be for our country . I mean, Moody's , Standard Poor 's, these agencies are telling us, if we increase this debt limit without credible and long-term deficit reduction , that they're going to lower our ratings. That means it's going to be harder and more expensive to borrow money . And we can't borrow another $10 trillion that the president's proposed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right. But, Senator, I'm sorry...\n\nSEN. DeMINT: And again, the president is not...\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...I'm not getting an answer, though. But what's going to happen? How does this end? I know what your position is. How does this end? Are you saying that you would put the country into default by not raising the debt ceiling unless you get this balanced budget amendment ?\n\nSEN. DeMINT: Well, David , we're not going to default . And if you listen to your previous guest, he said we won't meet some obligations, but he didn't say we were going to default . I don't want to put the country through that, but the fact is, Republicans and Democrats have been irresponsible. They've brought our debt to the point where we literally can't borrow much more money without bankrupting our country . So now is the time for the president, Senator Durbin , and the Democrats to work with us and at least agree that we can make some cuts now and cap spending over 10 years, and let the states decide if sometime over the next decade that we'll balance our budget .\n\nMR. GREGORY: You know, Senator...\n\nSEN. DeMINT: That's hardly a radical idea.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator Durbin , you and others have described what Senator DeMint just said as intransigence, a stubbornness, an unwillingness to negotiate. The reality is, it's exactly what Democrats said about President Bush when he wanted to raise the debt ceiling for bringing up too much debt. And the scale was completely different there. I mean, now you want $2.4 trillion in additional debt ceiling , then it was $800 billion. So you can understand why Republicans are saying enough has got to be enough.\n\nSEN. DURBIN: Well, I can understand it, but keep in mind that it was the economic policies of the Bush administration that led us into a situation where we more than doubled the national debt under President George W. Bush . Now I hear from Senator DeMint and others, let's stick with those same policies, giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America and not facing reality . David , let me tell you, those people who minimize the impact of a default on the debt ceiling , a default on America 's debt in our full faith and credit , really have said some things that are outrageous. Some of the Republican presidential candidates in Iowa , one of them says he's praying for a default . Another one said she is opposed to extending the debt ceiling . And others are saying, \"Well, listen, maybe we can't make Social Security payments for a month or two, maybe we can't pay our veterans what we promised, but we'll work it out .\" That is highly irresponsible. What we need to do is to sit down and work together. The president has laid out a big plan. Majority Leader Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats have said we want to work toward a big plan to reduce this deficit by at least $4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator, Senator Durbin ...\n\nSEN. DURBIN: We've got to do this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...my question is whether, Senator, whether President Obama is the one to really lead this. There are some progressives, as well as Republicans , who say that he has been late to this negotiation, late with ideas, and late to provide leadership .\n\nSEN. DURBIN: David , let me tell you, if you could've been in the White House Cabinet Room , as I was, for six separate meetings and watched this president of the United States patiently listen to each member of the leadership in Congress lay out their ideas of where to go and how we can do this together, if you know that he started the meeting saying, \"I'm putting everything on the table so that we can have a reasonable, comprehensive approach to it,\" you saw real leadership in action. I can't think of another president in my memory...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nSEN. DURBIN: ...who would've devoted that much time and that much patience to trying to bring both sides together.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, quickly...\n\nSEN. DURBIN: But, ultimately, the responsibility is ours.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Quickly, from both of you, Senator DeMint first, what happens in the end? What, what, what resolution do we get from or by August 2 ?\n\nSEN. DeMINT: David , we can't vote on a speech. The president hasn't sent us a proposal. There's been no proposal out of Democrats in the Senate . The only plan on the table that'll keep us from default and will keep us from falling to a negative rating is the cut cap and balance plan. Now, folks can say that it's outrageous to balance our budget , but over 70 percent of Americans think we need to.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right, but...\n\nSEN. DeMINT: And that's what we're going to insist on as Republicans . You're seeing real leadership now in the House from John Boehner , and that's the only leadership you're seeing in Washington right now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator Durbin , bottom line , what's going to happen? First of all, will they meet again today? Will folks meet today?\n\nSEN. DURBIN: There won't be a meeting of the same group, but I can tell you what's going on. Majority Leader Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell are working on an approach which will avoid this terrible deadline of August 2 and a default which would drive up interest rates and really hurt our economy . We will have a debate on the balanced budget amendment this week in the United States Senate . We've got to get this job done. The president is there standing by, willing to help us, but we have got to accept the initiative as elected leaders in Congress to really solve this problem and move America 's economy forward.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Before I let you both go, I want to ask you about the breaking news this morning and the reported arrest of Rebekah Brooks , the News of the World in Great Britain , and this scandal that's unfolding in the Murdoch media empire is something that also has reached here in the United States . Would you like to see congressional hearings as to whether there's any, you know, tie here to the United States in this phone hacking scandal, Senator Durbin ?\n\nSEN. DURBIN: Yes, I would. I can tell you that there are questions about whether the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been violated by Rupert Murdoch and his news empire . And what's going on in England is startling, to think of the extent that they went to to break the law to try to report a story. We need to follow through with the FBI investigation and also with congressional investigations.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator DeMint , what do you think?\n\nSEN. DeMINT: David , we need to let law enforcement work here. Congress has got a big issue in front of us. We need to handle our own business for a change and the focus this week is on the only plan we've got and that's cut cap and balance .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. We're going to leave it there. Thanks to both of you. Coming up, the debt deliberations are dominating the discussion here in Washington , but the question that remains at the top of voters' minds, of course , where are the jobs? I'm going to talk about that up next during a special MEET THE PRESS jobs and economy summit . Joining me on our panel this morning, the Republican governor of Ohio , John Kasich ; and chairman and CEO of Honeywell , David Cote ; president of the National Urban League , Marc Morial ; economist Diane Swonk ; and CNBC 's David Faber . Our jobs summit coming up right after this break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Coming up, Ohio Governor John Kasich , Marc Morial , David Faber , Diane Swonk , and David Cote . They're all here and ready to weigh in as part of our MEET THE PRESS jobs and economy summit . Our special roundtable discussion is up next, right after this brief commercial break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And we're back this morning with a special discussion about jobs and the economy . Joining me now, the former mayor of New Orleans , he's now the president of the National Urban League , Marc Morial ; Republican governor of Ohio , John Kasich ; the chairman and CEO of Honeywell , David Cote ; chief economist for Mesirow Financial , Diane Swonk ; and host of CNBC 's \"Strategy Session,\" David Faber . Welcome to all of you. Governor Kasich , your 20th appearance on MEET THE PRESS .\n\nGOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH): Is that right? I didn't know it was that much.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And so many of them -- I was just told this...\n\nGOV. KASICH: Twenty.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...so many of them, of course , when you were House budget chairman, so you know about what is going on. Can you explain it to the rest of us ? What is going on and how is this going to end?\n\nGOV. KASICH: You know, you always -- I was budget chairman, one of the chief architects the last time we balanced the budget in 1997 . It always gets down to the end. And -- but David , it's a matter of, of will, if both sides have a will to get this done, they will get it done.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But do you see the will now? Is it different from how it's been?\n\nGOV. KASICH: Well, I mean, there's a little -- look, it's always difficult to put a big deal together. Is the will there? I think right now they're still talking past one another.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. KASICH: But I have to tell you, in my state , where we faced an $8 billion deficit , we wiped it out, we eliminated it. And here's the interesting thing, we have just been taken off of negative watch in the middle of this and, and we also have jumped, according to CNBC , 11 places in terms of business friendly. We've been able to cut taxes , improve, reform government , and you know why? We looked it square in the eye because Ohio was dying, and we are beginning to really become business friendly. That is what they're not doing here in D.C. right now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah. All right, financial implications. Let's go around the horn here. Diane , what, what do you see? I mean, this, this debate about whether we're really going to default or not default ; seems like economists have been pretty clear : Don't mess with the debt ceiling .\n\nMS. DIANE SWONK: Don't mess with the debt ceiling . But, you know, it's interesting, because David and I were talking how little Wall Street is absorbing that this is a real possibility and even a probability. They're pricing in zero risk right now. But the thought that we actually might go past, this idea that you could go a day or two or three days or four days or -- that is just really ridiculous to...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. SWONK: You know, I was just abroad and our, our foreign counterparts, economists abroad are looking at me going, \"We got a real debt -- sovereign debt crisis here.\" Why would you deliberately give away your credit rating ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. SWONK: ...in the United States , deliberately undermine yourself, cut your nose out to spite to your face when you've got time to -- you've got -- you, you can fix it now and phase in the kind of changes and not have Greece .\n\nMR. GREGORY: David Cote , it appears like we're headed toward a small solution to a big problem ...\n\nMR. DAVID COTE: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...which is what a lot of corporate America thinks is wrong with Washington .\n\nMR. COTE: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: The -- are politics unable to meet the challenges we face?\n\nMR. COTE: It's the sort of thing that scares me is -- we're -- I'm -- Honeywell 's a global company , 37 billion in sales, got 130,000 people, half our sales and people outside the USA. Traveled the world a lot and the world has changed, we went from a billion participants in the global economy to four billion over the last 20 years, yet we still act like we did 20 years ago. And we need an American competitiveness agenda that gets our finances right, gets energy policy , math and science education , infrastructure, and we can't even do something like this. It's very scary as a businessman.\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to jump in to talking about jobs in just a second. David Faber , I do want to ask you about this breaking story that we're talking about. This is the cover of The Week magazine and it has Rupert Murdoch literally on the hot seat with the question \"Is Murdoch 's media empire nearing its end?\" The fact that Rebekah Brooks , who is the editor of News of the World , has reportedly been arrested for corruption and some other crimes. How serious is this at this point?\n\nMR. DAVID FABER: Well, it's, it's a very -- it's the most serious crisis that Murdoch has ever faced, certainly, in his long career, there's no doubt about that. And I think the middle of last week it started to sink in for him. Prior to that, people close to Murdoch , David , tell me that he perhaps had not appreciated the depth of anger that was taking place in the U.K. And perhaps for the first time in his long career, he wasn't out front of something, wasn't able to dictate the pace of events. That changed the middle of the week. You know, beginning of last week he had his arm around Rebekah Brooks . By the end of the week, of course , she was gone, so was his longtime lieutenant, Les Hinton . The key will be the U.S. You had earlier, of course , you asked the senators about the FBI probe. Will there be subpoenas issued? One never knows what will occur if that starts to happen. And ultimately -- what, if anything, is found in the U.S. will be a key for him. They are not going to be flatfooted in their response in the U.S. the same way they appear to have been in the U.K.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, you work for Fox News . What's the impact there? What's the reaction there?\n\nGOV. KASICH: Well, you know, they, they have not been touched by this, they have told me, and I believe them, and we just have to see how this all unfolds. It's a...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nGOV. KASICH: ...you know, Murdoch 's fired people, he's, you know, he's, he's quoted as, as being told that -- his hands in his, his -- in his, his head in his hands, crying with the family that was impacted. I mean, it's a, it's a terrible thing, and hopefully we'll get to the bottom of it. And it will change -- it'll change journalism. You know, I want to go back to something David said about the inability to solve problems. I think the business community has been absent. They played politics themselves. Instead of going to politicians and saying, \"You fix this thing,\" they -- give money to both sides . And they have been unwilling to stand up in too many cases and say, \"Enough is enough.\" Look, I don't think we just have a crisis in Washington of leadership , I think it's across all the sectors. I think we see it in sports where we let sometimes these thugs go out on the field and play on Sunday because they can score a touchdown. We see it in our pop culture. There is a crisis of leadership in America and we are witnessing it now in politics.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, let, let me, let me -- I want to, I want to focus this a little bit, I want to get Marc Morial in on this. I want to, I want to -- but I want to refocus to this primary question, too, because the, the debt fight is part of the backdrop to this still chronic problem of unemployment. Let me just show the...\n\nMS. SWONK: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...figures, Marc , if I can. This is unemployment around the states , the\n\nunemployment figures where it is highest: Nevada over 12 percent, California almost 12 percent; Rhode Island , Florida , and Michigan over 10 percent. Where are the jobs? Is government sufficiently focused on the question?\n\nMR. MARC MORIAL: We, we have a jobs crisis in America , and I think that the, the debt ceiling discussion should be decoupled from the deficit discussion , and the nation needs a jobs plan. We have 14 million people out of work. The black unemployment rate is at stifling levels. It's in fact increased since the recovery has begun. And so we need a jobs plan. And we need to be very cautious and careful that a deficit -cutting plan that unfairly targets vulnerable people -- jobs, housing and education programs -- might be a cause for short-term celebration and a cause for deepening the recession, stifling the recovery . That's the hard reality . And the polling shows -- my visits around the country demonstrate that's what's in the hearts and the minds of the American people .\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's driving this persistent jobless recovery ?\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, that's, you know, that's the real interesting issue is, one, I want to respond to the leadership issue. I've actually been involved in some of the bipartisan meetings around here. We've shown up together at meetings. And the business community , I've been warned, you know, \"Be careful, it's gotten so politicized you can't go out there.\"\n\nMR. COTE: Yeah, be careful.\n\nMS. SWONK: And I 'm just an economist. I'm talking about the economy and talking about what's best for the economy . I'm not being political. But it's gotten so politicized. I know people who said, \"I won't sit at that table and be seen with those politicians.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Dan , I want to focus for the moment...\n\nMS. SWONK: But the jobs -- let's get back to...\n\nMR. GREGORY: We can have a whole leadership debate , which is worthwhile.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yeah, I know. But the job -- yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But I want to focus on where the jobs are.\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, you know, I want to, I want to -- no, but wait a minute here. There is an issue. You know, in Norway , Sweden and Finland they had a financial crisis in the early '90s. They did everything right. They had consensus in government , they reformed, they went toward more market reforms, they got their fiscal house in order. You know the one thing that disturbs me? Twenty years later, they've never hit their pre- crisis lows on unemployment. Twenty years later, the rate of participation in labor force , which is one of the things I view as a hope, throw your hat in, say you're looking for a job, is still lower than it was before the crisis , and long-term unemployment is still higher.\n\nMR. GREGORY: David Faber , Robert Reich ...\n\nMS. SWONK: That bothers me.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...writes this in, in a, in The Wall Street Journal on Friday about what we're\n\nfacing: \"When the Great Recession wiped out $7.8 trillion of home values,\" this is a former Labor secretary, \"it crushed the nest eggs and eliminated the collateral of America 's middle class . As a result, consumer spending has been decimated. ... \"We're in a vicious cycle in which job and wage losses further reduce Americans ' willingness to spend, which further slows the economy . Job growth has effectively stopped. The fraction of\n\nthe population now working is near a 25-year low lower than it was when the recession officially ended in June of 2009 .\"\n\nMR. FABER: Yeah, I mean, all of those are frightening statistics. There's no doubt this is a consumer-led economy and has been for some time, and you've had a significant pullback by consumers on their willingness to spend, in part because of that old uncertainty. CEOs may like to use it, but consumers actually face it at home. If I don't have a job or if I lose my job, of course , I am not going to be spending money . That being said, I mean, I'm curious, you know, we talk about a jobs crisis now, David , but the fact is that during the Bush presidency we had the lowest job creation numbers we ever had annually, about three million total jobs over those eight years. The question really is, has there been a seminal change in the ability of the U.S. economy to create jobs? That certainly is something that a lot of people are starting to believe. You heard David Cote talking about these larger issues of competitiveness. Much of that goes back to that. But we haven't created a lot of jobs for a very, very long time, not just the last year.\n\nMR. COTE: Well, we're...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Why? What's happened?\n\nMR. COTE: Well, right now the problem that we've got is uncertainty of demand. Businesses don't add until they're sure that there's -- somebody's going to want to actually buy something. To that I would add, we've added uncertainty of regulation. And when you combine those two, it just causes businesses to say, \"I'm going to wait a little bit.\" And I always find it interesting when I hear government say...\n\nMR. FABER: But you guys always say that. David ...\n\nMR. COTE: ...\"We need to create jobs.\" And I say no, actually, government doesn't create jobs. Government can create an environment where jobs can be created. And I think it's important to distinguish between those two.\n\nGOV. KASICH: You know, David -- here, let me, let me just say one thing about David , because I...\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, but, but, but I'm......less if, if the, if it's growing 6 to 8 percent, the economy , it would be a no-brainer, we would be generating jobs and the uncertainty would be away -- erased.\n\nGOV. KASICH: Look, believe it or not , consumer spending is up over the last eight months, OK?\n\nMS. SWONK: I know that.\n\nGOV. KASICH: Here's the problem . Here's the problem .\n\nMS. SWONK: Not enough.\n\nGOV. KASICH: This man doesn't know what's coming, whether it's regulation, whether it's taxes . And this high debt pre-supposes you're going to have higher taxes . He can't make a decision about investment when the roof's about to cave in.\n\nMR. MORIAL: But that's a -- but that...\n\nMS. SWONK: No, but, it's more than that.\n\nGOV. KASICH: He needs certainty. That's what we're trying to do in Ohio .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, Marc , Marc Morial .\n\nMR. MORIAL: I'm glad you raise the issue of demand because I think there's a lot of politics in uncertainty about taxes , uncertainty about regulation. The bottom line is there's not enough demand in the economy . So if you have a job, you're concerned about being laying -- laid off. Look at state and local government , where you've had a plethora of layoffs over the last eight months. If there are further budget cuts from the federal government in those areas, you're going to have more layoffs, and the private sector's not poised because of demand to pick that up. We need a jobs plan in this country . If as much time was devoted to a consensus jobs plan as the country 's devoting to a consensus deficit reduction plan, then in fact...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But I'm not sure -- but, Governor, what does that actually mean? Because that's the question of what is it -- I asked the Treasury secretary last week, does the president have to acknowledge, \"Look, there's things we've done, there's things the Fed can do, but we can only do so much as the government \"? That's the sad political truth.\n\nGOV. KASICH: David , when a business -- and I 've been in business for 10 years before I got this governor's job -- when a business is uncertain about the future, they sit on the sidelines. We have more -- we have so much money on the sidelines waiting to be invested, but they're uncertain about where we're going to go. The answer, get this God darn deficit under control, do not raise taxes on capital gains risk taking, provide incentives for investment, real changes in education to connect our kids with real job opportunities. And, you know, if you begin to -- and, and lay down some, some certainty on regulatory reform , he'll be investing.\n\nMR. FABER: Well, you know what? He's got $3 billion , right? Over $3 billion in cash in your balance sheet , don't you? It's probably gone up.\n\nMR. COTE:\n\nMR. FABER: That was last quarter, so it's probably gone up. It's not yours, obviously.\n\nMR. COTE: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMR. FABER: It's your shareholders'. But you're choosing a -- what'd you spend, $800 million on capital expenditures this year?\n\nMR. COTE: Yes. Yeah.\n\nMR. FABER: All right, could have been more. Could be a lot more, right?\n\nMR. COTE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. FABER: But, you know, I hear this uncertainty about regulation and, frankly, I think a lot of CEOs say it because why not, why not get some regulatory relief if you can, or tax relief. But at the end of the day your first answer, demand, it would seem to me is the key.\n\nMR. COTE: Oh, that's the big one. It's uncertainty and demand.\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, and, and...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, can we just, can we just unpack that a little bit? Because this idea that the consumer being king, that debt is really the issue -- there's government debt , there's personal debt . People that deleveraging, the fancy term of basically getting out from under your debt...\n\nMS. SWONK: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...paying your debt down means you're not spending...\n\nMS. SWONK: By choice, of course .\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...you're not creating demand. Businesses, it seems to me, Diane , are actually making a decision, which is, \"We're just going to get leaner and meaner.\" The jobs aren't coming back.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yeah. That's, that's -- well, many of the jobs aren't coming back, but the jobs that do come back are ones that we never expect. The fact that we're in a renaissance in the manufacturing sector .\n\nMR. COTE: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nMS. SWONK: It's a lack of imagination. I do think the one silver lining here, and as part of the reason we haven't generated jobs, is because coming out of a financial crisis like you do, this is the nature of it. You don't get enough growth and enough demand. That said, where's the silver lining ? We've had more IPOs since the fourth quarter of, of 2010 than we've had since 2000 . Why is that important? New businesses -- not just small businesses , new businesses interacting with established firms is where you get the miracle in job creation . That was what happened in the 1990s to an extreme. Companies that never should have hired. And there may be some bubbles out there, we can all talk about some of the...\n\nMR. FABER: Companies that never should have been able to raise capital .\n\nMS. SWONK: Right, and they did. And that may be happening today. But they did hire...\n\nMR. FABER: But it's, it's a good point. I mean, if you want a good news story, take a look at Groupon , for example, a name some of your viewers may know.\n\nMS. SWONK: It's in Chicago . Yes, I know.\n\nMR. FABER: Seven thousand employees have been hired over the last couple of years.\n\nMS. SWONK: At one point in time...\n\nMR. FABER: Google , for example, one of the -- only 10 years old, 28,600 employees; 2,400 employees added over the last quarter.\n\nMR. COTE: But, you know, David , one of the...\n\nMS. SWONK: And it's not, not just high tech jobs. They're sales jobs.\n\nMR. FABER: There is still growth in this economy in those areas.\n\nMR. MORIAL: What, what this, what this conversation shows is that Wall Street is back, the business community 's come back, but Main Street and Back Street lag behind.\n\nMS. SWONK: Main Street lagging. Right.\n\nMR. MORIAL: And it may point to the fact that these are structural shifts in the American economy .\n\nMS. SWONK: Yes.\n\nMR. MORIAL: We have to focus on competitiveness, yes, but producing things so that when we spend money in this country it creates jobs in this country .\n\nMS. SWONK: But we are doing that.\n\nMR. MORIAL: So we need a larger plan...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well...\n\nGOV. KASICH: We also need -- we also...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Quick, quick point, Governor, then we're going to go to break .\n\nGOV. KASICH: We also need training in real world .\n\nMS. SWONK: Yes.\n\nMR. COTE: Mm-hmm.\n\nGOV. KASICH: Vouchers for companies so they can train for things that they need. In Ohio , because we faced our, our $8 billion budget deficit and provide tax relief, what's happened? CNBC says we've jumped 11 points in...\n\nMR. FABER: All right.\n\nGOV. KASICH: ...11 places in terms of business friendly. The credit agencies say your credit, we have taken you off of negative watch. When you provide certainty to people, then they are able to, they're able to respond to it. And what we're seeing in Ohio are positive things. If they did it in Washington , we'd be better. You know, that's where you have to go.\n\nMS. SWONK: Well...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let, let me -- I want to get a break in here, I want to get a break in here. I want to talk more about the issue of jobs, the overall economy , when, when a recovery will actually feel like recovery , including the debate over taxes and their relationship to economic growth . More with our panel after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back with our discussion about the economy , which continued even during the break because this is a hot topic , as you know, and these are spirited folks.\n\nMS. SWONK: And we decided we could talk.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. I want to talk about the debate over taxes . And it's very interesting. You had House Speaker John Boehner on Friday say the following about these debt talks and taxes .\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH): Our stand on the debt limit has been clear . There can be no tax hikes because tax hikes destroy jobs.\n\nMR. GREGORY: That's the assertion. Is that really true? Ron Brownstein took a whack at\n\nthat in his column in the National Journal this weekend and this is what he writes: \"In the past three decades, job growth has thrived after tax cuts and after tax increases , and it has stagnated after tax cuts . If there's a pattern, it's that tax policy typically isn't the decisive factor in driving a machine as complex as the U.S. economy . Given those precedents, tax policy ought to be seen not as a secret to growth but, more modestly, as one part of the fiscal policy toolbox. And on that front, the case against including some revenue in a comprehensive deficit - reduction package is even weaker.\" Budget Chairman, Governor...\n\nGOV. KASICH: Well, David ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...you were -- you were for closing tax loopholes.\n\nGOV. KASICH: I was. Yeah. I was. Look, in '97, we cut taxes , by the way. We cut taxes on capital gains . We balanced our budget , the economy was going great. The problem with tax increases , I was telling David this, he was on the Bowles Commission , God bless him, is that you raise the taxes , they spend the money but they never cut the spending. David , I saw it. When Bush said, \"Read my lips,\" and then he caved in on the tax, tax increase. We but Gramm-Rudman in. This was this program to cut spending. We spent the money , and every time we got to the cuts, we put them off. Now, the problem we have here is we have a spending problem , not a tax problem . But I would support loophole closings, lowering rates, lowering the corporate rate. Lowering the personal rate.\n\nMR. FABER: OK.\n\nGOV. KASICH: But, frankly, the revenues that come from that shouldn't be spent up front.\n\nMR. MORIAL: David ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Marc , can I just show you one thing...\n\nMR. MORIAL: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...from Grover Norquist , who amplifies in this argument.\n\nMR. MORIAL: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We talked to him as part of our Press Pass conversation that's available on our blog and I asked him why don't conservatives care as much about deficits as they do keeping taxes low and this is what he said.\n\nMR. GROVER NORQUIST: The problem is we're spending too much money . Raising taxes is no part of spending less money . Raising taxes is what politicians do instead of spending less money . Obama , Reid , and Pelosi have jumped up spending from $2.9 trillion to $3.8 trillion , almost a trillion dollars addition each year going forward. We need to pull that down. Raising taxes just enables that. I mean, if you're smoking too much, the solution is to smoke less.\n\nMR. MORIAL: Grover is engaging in spin because the issue is not tax increases , it's tax reform , tax simplification , and closing loopholes. The dirty secret of Washington is that the tax earmark business tied to K Street lobbyists is bigger than the spending earmark business. So you've got $1 trillion worth of tax loopholes. And if Congress would attack that and if the conversation would be about tax simplification and reform , we might be able to get a combined package. I reject the idea that spending on domestic programs -- housing , jobs, programs like food stamps -- is the reason for the budget deficit .\n\nMS. SWONK:\n\nMR. MORIAL: You had wars, you had wars. You had increases in the prescription drug benefit program. You had a wide range of things. You had tax cuts . They all piled onto the deficit .\n\nMR. GREGORY: But let me...\n\nMR. MORIAL: So don't fix the deficit on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans .\n\nMR. GREGORY: David , David Cote , what about corporations and taxes ? We hear about the need to lower tax rates , but then you have companies that aren't paying taxes at all.\n\nMS. SWONK: Right.\n\nMR. COTE: Well, if you wanted the most dynamic jobs creating economy in the world, you would have a 0 percent corporate tax rate. However, nobody can stand that because, in our pursuit of fairness, we actually hurt the very people we're trying to be fair to. So if we say, all right, what we need to do is, in the pursuit of fairness, attach some kind of tax rate , you should make it the most simple, easy to thing to do possible.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yes.\n\nMR. COTE: And that's why I think the Simpson - Bowles Commission , I think we got it right. Is we said take it away for everybody.\n\nMS. SWONK: Right.\n\nMR. COTE: All the exclusions, all the exemptions, all -- take it away for everybody so that you broaden the base and just significantly lower the rates.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yes.\n\nMR. COTE: You can get an increase in taxes , and everybody's going to be happy, and corporations will also get territorially. So they'll be able to get their cash back from outside the U.S.\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, and this gets to the issue of we have -- we're in a position where we -- freedoms are what we love in this country . We have the freedom to decide what our future is going to be like or we have -- are going to give away that freedom and let the world decide for us. And in the long term, if we get on a more simplified tax -- get out of these complications, eliminate the loopholes, lower the rates, get in a more clean tax code , we're going to be making better decisions economically.\n\nMR. COTE: Exactly, exactly.\n\nMS. SWONK: We're going to be more competitive economically. And that's an opportunity to let it go away because of lobbyists and all the little -- the tax lobbyists that we talk about. That is just -- it's incomprehensible right now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But it's interesting, Diane . David Faber , we were in a position in these negotiations, Boehner and the president, talking about raising some taxes while at the same time getting the sort of tax reform that you're talking about and there was a disagreement ultimately about not so much where rates were, but how progressive it was and it got a bit complicated. But we couldn't even get to that point.\n\nMR. FABER: Yeah. It seems an impossibility that what we just heard from our panelists would actually ever occur, elimination of all loopholes.\n\nMR. FABER: It would be great to...\n\nGOV. KASICH:\n\nMR. FABER: Well, you're in Ohio .\n\nMR. GREGORY: It would be close to '97.\n\nMR. FABER: Yeah. You did, and...\n\nMS. SWONK: In '86, '87.\n\nMR. FABER: ...then somehow we got them all back, didn't we?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well...\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, that's the problem .\n\nMR. FABER:\n\nMR. COTE: I think you have to do it every 20 years.\n\nMS. SWONK: They closed them, '86 was the biggest year.\n\nMR. GREGORY: David , go ahead, yeah.\n\nMR. COTE: If you think that's true.\n\nMS. SWONK: Maybe if we do it every 10.\n\nMR. GREGORY: David Faber , go ahead.\n\nMR. FABER: Well, listen, David , you know, we started this conversation about the markets to a certain extent.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Sure.\n\nMR. FABER: And the debt ceiling . And the fact is, if you were to get that $4 trillion in spending cuts and see some compromise, you'd get a very positive response from our creditors around the world.\n\nGOV. KASICH: Yeah.\n\nMS. SWONK:\n\nMR. MORIAL: You know, that's why, perhaps...\n\nMR. FABER: There's no doubt. It seems, though, unfortunately, perhaps something simply too far beyond our leaders' ability.\n\nMR. MORIAL: They ought to pass the debt limit and continue to have discussions about a consensus plan that's going to create jobs and address all of these problems.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yes. Well, well, but -- no.\n\nMR. MORIAL: It's being done under the pressure of a false deadline.\n\nMS. SWONK: I think there's also some...\n\nMR. MORIAL: And that is tying this to the debt limit vote. Look, the car was purchased, it was driven off the lot, now we're going to debate whether we sign the loan papers?\n\nGOV. KASICH: Look, I mean, at the end of the day , you have to deal with this deficit and you're not going to get it done without reforming programs.\n\nMS. SWONK: Right.\n\nMR. MORIAL: Mm-hmm.\n\nGOV. KASICH: Mayor, I would just disagree with you on this. I believe it is possible to design a federal government that doesn't hurt the most vulnerable by bringing in reform of those programs.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yeah.\n\nGOV. KASICH: We've done it in Ohio with Medicaid .\n\nMS. SWONK:\n\nGOV. KASICH: We saved billions and the AARP supports our program. We let mom and dad stay at home if they qualify for a nursing home , it saves us a lot of money .\n\nMR. FABER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. SWONK:\n\nMR. MORIAL: ...mm-hmm.\n\nGOV. KASICH: But so I think that's one thing. The loophole closings ultimately will happen because if you can get lower flat rates, it's going to happen. But at this point, look, we all know it. If we don't deal with the $14 trillion debt by changing the spending patterns of Washington ...\n\nMS. SWONK: Oh, yeah.\n\nGOV. KASICH: ...the markets are not going to respond positively.\n\nMR. GREGORY: I have two questions. I want to go back to David Faber , and I want to put up the housing crisis , which is still a crisis . Look at the bright spots and the weak spots around the country in terms of housing markets. The cities with the highest increases in home prices , D.C. , San Francisco , which would include Silicon Valley , which is hot because of technology out there.\n\nMS. SWONK: ...right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Atlanta, Seattle. And then the highest drops in home prices , Detroit , Vegas , Chicago , and Tampa . The reality is that everything the federal government has tried to do has not worked. A lot of threats about the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Everybody's afraid to wind those down because they're the only ones propping up our housing market . Can we have recovery until we bottom out on housing ?\n\nMR. FABER: It's very hard to imagine we're going to have a significant recovery until we bottom out on housing , not just because of the -- what you mentioned. I talked earlier about the lack of job growth under the Bush administration . So much of that came as a result of a housing boom that ultimately turned into this bust...\n\nMS. SWONK: Right. Too late...\n\nMR. FABER: ...that you're talking about with construction and all the related industries. So there's a lot of employment related to a recovery in housing , there's also a psychological impact. When you are underwater on your mortgage, as about 30 percent of people are in this country , when your mortgage is worth more than your home, you're not going to go out and spend a great deal of money .\n\nMR. GREGORY: right.\n\nMR. FABER: Of course , the reverse occurred in the mid-aughts when we watched everybody taking out home equity loans because of the incredible rise in the value of their homes, and that resulted in enormous consumer spending . So housing is very much interrelated to the economic problems that we continue to have.\n\nMR. GREGORY: David Cote , here's a bottom line question.\n\nMR. COTE: Mm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You are a jobs creator...\n\nMR. COTE: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...you're a businessman, explain to folks out there who are either scared about losing their job or have been out of work for a long time...\n\nMR. COTE: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...when is economic recovery actually going to feel like economic recovery ?\n\nMR. COTE: Well, it never feels like a recovery till you get your job back, right?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. COTE: I mean, it's at that point that you get there. But it's interesting with consumers; we're at a, a point where we tell them, \"We need you spending, but hey, by the way, save for a rainy day because bad times happen.\"\n\nMS. SWONK: And you don't get any credit either.\n\nMR. COTE: And those two don't quite go together. We need to start thinking about consumers perhaps a little differently when it comes to something like oil prices because right now you take a look at consumers, they're just starting to feel a little bit better, the news is generally better. Now they're paying 4 bucks a gallon for gas and they're saying, \"I don't know where this is going to go.\" We need a different policy when it comes to oil, for example. If we just allowed more drilling -- and by the way, I keep saying, I'm an energy efficiency guy, my whole company's devoted to that; however, oil supply would make a big difference in driving down gas prices and putting money in people's pockets, generating royalties for the, for the government and generating a couple of hundred thousand jobs in the process. That's the sort of changes that we ought to be thinking about that I don't even see us talking about that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, let me get my final break in here, we'll do that, and we'll come back with our Trends Takeaways , a look at what was said here today and what to look for in the coming week. Plus, what are the hot political stories trending this very morning? That's coming up right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back. Final moments with our roundtable. And we wanted to refer back to a takeaway sound bite from earlier in the program from Jack Lew , the president's budget director, who again reiterated the stakes in these negotiations. This is what he said.\n\nMR. LEW: I think that if you look at where the parties are, compared to discussions over the last decades, there are things that both sides are talking about doing that are very dramatic. I think we -- there's still time to get something big done. The president has made it clear he wants to do something substantial.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Marc Morial , we're still waiting . You listen to the senators this morning, there didn't seem to be a lot of room, they want to spend the next week talking about a balanced budget amendment .\n\nMR. MORIAL: I think they're going to need to engage in sort of a temporary measure to raise the debt ceiling and I think they should continue their discussions. I don't think it should be the end. It's an artificial deadline. A plan for the future of the economy and a fiscal plan for the nation is going to take more time.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are watching, of course , as there is a simultaneous conversation going on online this morning, and from Facebook there's this from Christopher G , \"I think both sides are playing chicken with an important situation and I believe that both sides need to agree and stop this same scuffle that you would see two kindergarteners have with a toy they both wanted.\" It's interesting, David Cote , The Weekly Standard cover shows the following scene taking place here in Washington , \"Pols playing poker,\" with Republican and Democratic leaders really facing each other off at this point to see who will blink first.\n\nMR. COTE: Well, I -- the way I've likened it is it's, it's like both parties have a grip on each other's throat, and they're more focused on simultaneous asphyxiation than they are on actually resolving the problem . And that -- that's got to change. We can't -- we -- we're not going to be a competitive power in the world unless we start to be able...\n\nMS. SWONK: Right.\n\nMR. COTE: ...to fix things, like get our fiscal house in order. It's sad.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Is there a threshold -- real quick, Diane -- a threshold where it has to be of a certain level for our creditors to think we're serious?\n\nMS. SWONK: Well, our credit -- we've already seen -- the debt rating agencies have said, \"We, we don't make August 2nd \"...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. SWONK: ...they're going to downgrade us.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. SWONK: So yeah, the threshold is here already, but Washington 's not listening to that, Wall Street 's not listening to that. But I think...\n\nMR. COTE: And maybe at $4 trillion -- we could be doing this again in five years.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMS. SWONK: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor Kasich , I want to show you our trend tracker, the hottest political\n\nstories this morning as we're following them: The debt limit debate , the president who met with the Dalai Lama, and Obama 2012 fundraising. He's raising a lot of money . I do want to ask\n\nyou the political question: Are you going to endorse a Republican candidate in the process of the primaries?\n\nGOV. KASICH: Not for a while. Not for a while.\n\nMR. GREGORY: In the primaries or not?\n\nGOV. KASICH: I don't know if I -- I, I, I don't, I don't know yet. David , let me say, you know, I had, had a little golf game with John Boehner ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. KASICH: ...the president and the vice president.

    "text":"Good afternoon, Phoenix! I\u2019m so glad to be here with you all.\n\nOne of the core values of our campaign is that we\u2019re \u201cstronger together.\u201d That means we know that the only way to change this country for the better is by working with each other. So it\u2019s important to us to communicate with as many people as possible \u2013 and to listen to as many people as possible \u2013 and share our positive vision for America.\n\nThis country has a foundation that spreads out all across the planet. It has roots in Africa and Asia, many of whose people were brought here against their will, but became part of the fabric of our society. It\u2019s rooted in Native Americans, who have always been here. And it\u2019s enriched by immigrants from all corners \u2013 places like Ireland, where my family first came from.\n\nAnd people sometimes forget \u2013 and some may not even know \u2013 that the Hispanic community has been part of our country since the Spanish arrived in St. Augustine in 1565. That was well before the British landed in North America.\n\nSpanish was the first European language spoken in this country. A few years ago, I gave the first speech ever delivered in Spanish on the Senate floor. Since we were debating a bill about immigration, explaining it in Spanish just made sense \u2013 especially since it\u2019s the language of more than 40 million people in this country who are most affected by this issue.\n\nI feel the same way about this election. With so much at stake for the Hispanic community, it just makes sense to make the case for our campaign in a language that\u2019s spoken by so many families across the country.\n\nI don\u2019t speak Spanish perfectly. But I picked up what I could while working with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. I took the skills I learned as a boy, working in my father\u2019s ironworking shop, and I put them to use in the village of El Progreso, teaching young people carpentry and metalwork.\n\nThat experience changed my life, and I have carried it with me ever since, in every position I\u2019ve held \u2013 civil rights lawyer, city councilman, mayor, lieutenant governor, governor, and senator.\n\nWhat I learned in Honduras comes down to three things: Fe, familia y trabajo duro. Those were also the values I learned in my Irish-Catholic family in Kansas City. There\u2019s one other basic belief that Hillary and I share: Do all the good you can and serve one another. It\u2019s pretty simple.\n\nAnd today, I recognize those same values in every state in our nation, by people of all skin colors, religions and backgrounds. And in this campaign, it\u2019s been inspiring to see people from across our country coming together to address the challenges we face.\n\nI believe that God has created a beautiful and rich tapestry in our country, an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everybody in love and battle back against the dark forces of division.\n\nPresidential elections are always a choice between two visions for our country\u2026 a choice between two candidates.\n\nBut this year it\u2019s a little bit different. It\u2019s about America looking in the mirror and deciding what we see there.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a question of a president\u2019s temperament and experience, although those are very important qualities. What\u2019s really on the ballot is Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cstronger together\u201d vision versus Donald Trump\u2019s frightening and divisive vision for our country.\n\nSo today, I wanted you to hear directly from me, that under a Clinton-Kaine Administration, everyone will have a place in America.\n\nLatinos have always shaped this country\u2026 From your service in the military, to your spirit of entrepreneurship\u2026 to your presence\n\non the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd by 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population. So of course Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.\n\nTodos somos americanos.\n\nWe need all Americans, from all backgrounds, to help write the next chapters in our nation\u2019s story \u2013 just as you have always done. This community has been part of a long struggle that has shown your resilience and your power.\n\nIn recent years, many of those battles have been waged right here in Arizona. In many ways, Phoenix was one of the birthplaces of the modern immigrant rights movement, when people from all over the country came to organize against SB1070 \u2013 a bill that went against so many of our shared values.\n\nThat battle isn\u2019t over\u2026 Right now, in this election, you are all leading the way in the next phase of progress. But we\u2019re up against some pretty tough opponents.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s biggest supporters, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who\u2019s facing criminal charges for profiling Latinos and has persecuted undocumented immigrants. He says he thinks Trump will get \u201ca lot of Hispanic votes.\u201d\n\nDo you think he\u2019s right?\n\nJust the other day, your former governor, Jan Brewer, who signed into law the discriminatory SB1070 that promoted racial profiling, said that she wasn\u2019t worried about her candidate, Donald Trump, winning this state, because, as she said, Latinos \u201cdon\u2019t get out and vote.\u201d\n\nDo you think she\u2019s right?\n\nI think Jan Brewer must not be paying very close attention. Because\n\nmillions of Americans are coming together \u2013 Democrats and Republicans and Independents \u2013 to support Hillary Clinton and reject Donald Trump and everything he stands for.\n\nHere in Arizona, our campaign is surging. More than a million people have already voted early, and the rate of Hispanic voters has nearly doubled compared to four years ago. We are also seeing the same energy from the Latino community in early vote in states like Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and other states.\n\nSo I hate to break it to the Trump campaign, but Latinos are going to have a really big voice in this election\u2026 And the choice is really clear.\n\nOn the one hand, you have Hillary Clinton. Someone who\u2019s spent her entire life working on behalf of kids and families. She started her career at an organization that fights for children and their families, at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. Registering Latino voters in South Texas and fought; fighting for universal healthcare and equal rights. In other words, she\u2019s lista. Hillary Clinton is lista.\n\nOn the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Someone who thinks \u201cLatino outreach\u201d means tweeting out a picture of a taco bowl.\n\nIn the first weeks of his campaign, Donald Trump said that immigrants from Mexico are drug dealers, rapists, murderers. In the last debate, Trump referred to them as \u201cbad hombres.\u201d\n\nHe insists that \u201cthis is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.\u201d He doesn\u2019t understand that multilingual and bilingual families contribute to the diversity that makes our nation strong.\n\nHe once called Alicia Machado, the winner of his Miss Universe pageant, \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u2026\u201d And a month ago, he decided to pick a fight with her on Twitter and in interviews for days.\n\nAnd he attacked Gonzalo Curiel \u2013 the distinguished judge in the fraud lawsuit against Trump University. Now, Judge Curiel was born in Indiana. His parents were born in Mexico. But Donald actually said Judge Curiel can\u2019t be trusted to do his job because of his \u201cMexican heritage.\u201d\n\nEven the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump, said that was the \u201cdefinition of a racist comment.\u201d\n\nJudge Curiel is as American as I am. And he\u2019s as American as Donald Trump.\n\nWhether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed\u2026 Hillary Clinton and I believe we are brothers and my sisters, and we will be your champions.\n\nYou\u2019re our neighbors, colleagues, friends and families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, and more creative. And I want all of you to know that we see you, and we are with you.\n\nAmerica is a better country because of you.\n\nHillary and I have a positive vision for what we want to accomplish.\n\nYou know, when Hillary first called me up and told me she had chosen me to be her running mate, here\u2019s what she said\u2026\n\nThe definition of success in a Clinton-Kaine Administration won\u2019t be the number of laws we pass, but whether we can make life a little easier for a working mother, or help a child learn better in a classroom, or help a person who\u2019s made a mistake get a second chance. At that moment, I knew we were going to be soul mates in this journey.\n\nHillary and I are making two major promises for the first 100 days of our administration.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And I don\u2019t need to tell anyone here that we still have some work to do to get there.\n\nLatinos are 17 percent of our country\u2019s population, but they hold only 2 percent of its wealth. That\u2019s just not right. We\u2019ve got to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages\u2026 with more opportunities to go to college, launch new ventures, and build wealth that you can pass on to your kids.\n\nOne of the keys to that is small business. Hillary and I are two kids of two fathers who built small businesses, and we know need to do much more to support the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs across America. Our plan will make it easier to start one, increase access to capital, and invest $25 billion in the communities that need it most.\n\nAnd at a time when education is more important than ever for the jobs of the future, we\u2019ll fight for universal pre-school, good schools in every ZIP code, and make sure no one has to give up on their dreams of college because they can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nOver the last 20 years, the number of Latinos going to college has tripled. That\u2019s great news. And yet, Latinos are still less likely than their white peers to graduate \u2013 often because they can\u2019t afford to.\n\nOur plan will help change that. We\u2019re going to make community college\n\nfree. We\u2019re going to make in-state public universities debt-free. And for families making less than $125,000 a year, we\u2019ll completely eliminate tuition at those schools. That\u2019s how we can start to break down all the economic barriers that are holding you back.\n\nSecond, Hillary and I will introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.\n\nToo many children in America say goodbye to their parents every morning, not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.\n\nDonald Trump wants to create a deportation nation. Trump wants to deport almost 16 million people. He wants to deport 11.5 million\n\nundocumented people. And he wants to eliminate citizenship for 4.5 million people who were born in the United States to parents without documents undocumented parents and deport them as well.\n\nThis goes against one of the most important values in our Constitution \u2013 a person born here in the United States is a citizen. Hillary and I will fight against Trump\u2019s divisive plan with all of our efforts.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is go to the naturalization services where people become U.S. citizens.\n\nUsually, after the oath is taken, there\u2019s an open microphone, and people get to walk up and explain why they decided to become a citizen. Their stories just bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your face when you hear what they think about the greatness of the United States of America.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but think: Cualquier persona que ama tanto a los Estados Unidos merece estar aqu\u00ed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to fight so hard for comprehensive immigration reform, and in the meantime, we\u2019ll do everything we can to keep families together.\n\nA few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it\u2019s important to note that the Court didn\u2019t actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President\u2019s authority, and we will keep fighting for it.\n\nWe also need to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and round-ups. They\u2019re not right. They\u2019re not necessary. And they\u2019re not consistent with our values.\n\nI want to close by explaining why Hillary and I believe that we\u2019re stronger together. It\u2019s something that has always united Democrats. We\u2019re not just looking out for ourselves, we\u2019re people who look out for those among us that need help.\n\nIn my church, we talk about the story of the Good Samaritan. There\u2019s somebody who\u2019s beaten up and lying at the side of the road. And a lot of people walk on by \u2013 people who should know better, people who are leaders, people who have titles. They just walk on by. I bet somebody walked on by and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a loser.\u201d\n\nBut then a Samaritan, who in that story was sort of an outcast, says I\u2019m going to go help him out.\n\nToday, there are a lot of people in this country who on the side of the road asking for help. Maybe they need a job, or need to figure out how to pay for college. Maybe they\u2019re struggling with an illness, or are a victim of violence. Maybe they\u2019re being bullied, or they\u2019re just somebody who needs a second chance.\n\nThey\u2019re all there, by the side of the road, asking for help.\n\nHillary Clinton and I believe that we can\u2019t just walk on by. Democrats don\u2019t walk on by. Arizonans don\u2019t walk on by. Americans don\u2019t walk on by.\n\nThat\u2019s just not who we are. We go over and help. And if we want this country to remain a place where we are measured by how we help others, then we need every single person here to vote. And we need you to bring your friends, and families, and neighbors to vote too.\n\nFor the first time in a while, the state of Arizona is competitive \u2013 and every single vote counts. Tomorrow is the last day of early voting in Arizona\u2026 But why wait until then when everyone can vote today!\n\nEarly voting is open until tomorrow. The nearest early voting location is the Maryvale-Cartwright School District Annex Building, at 3401 North 67th Avenue.\n\nThis election isn\u2019t just about where we\u2019re going. It\u2019s about who we are.\n\nI think we\u2019re a country where we all belong. A country that chooses love over hate. A country that builds on the progress we\u2019ve made instead of going backward. That, as we used to say in Honduras, goes adelante, no atr\u00e1s.\n\nAnd to anyone who says that we can\u2019t realize that vision, let\u2019s reply with the chant that has echoed through our history:\n\nSi, se puede!\n\nGracias, Phoenix. Let\u2019s go vote. And let\u2019s go win.",

    "text":"\n\nA Madison, Miss., precinct worker offers a voter a \"I voted\" sticker after voting in party primaries on Tuesday, June 3, 2014. Mississippi's new voter ID law was put to its first test in Tuesday\u2019s primaries. (AP Photo\/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nNote: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting.\n\nVoter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.\n\nPart of this litigation \u2014 and any rational debate about the issue generally \u2014 hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice.\n\nFirst, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don\u2019t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they\u2019re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win.\n\nSecond, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud \u2026 that ID laws aren\u2019t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including \"registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,\" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations.\n\nThis sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you\u2019ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren\u2019t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop.\n\nInstead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens.\n\nI\u2019ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I\u2019ve been following reports wherever they crop up.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.\n\nSome of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I\u2019d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.\n\nIn just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn\u2019t include voters without ID who didn\u2019t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away?\n\nCorrection: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School.\n\nCredible allegations of potential fraud since 2000 that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls\n\nNote: tracking the allegations \u2014 even those that may end up disproven \u2014 can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not \u2014 please \u2014 examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well.\n\nMay 2014: Ben Hodzic allegedly voted at the polls in the name of his brother in the Catskill School District Board of Education election in Catskill, NY.[1] Nov. 2013: Mark Atlas allegedly voted at the polls in the name of someone else in the municipal election in Worcester, MA.[2] Sep. 2013: At least four, and possibly 20-24, Hasidic voters in the South Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, allegedly attempted to vote at the polls under others\u2019 names in the municipal primary elections for New York City.[3] Mar. 2013: Kristina Bentrim went to vote at the polls in the Cedar Rapids, IA, special election on a gambling referendum, and was allegedly told that someone had voted in her name.[4] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Angela Cooney in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Angela Cooney listed as dying 4 years earlier.[5] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Evan Dixon in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Evan Dixon listed as dying 11 years earlier.[6] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Alejandro Guerrero in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Alejandro Guerrero listed as dying 5 years earlier.[7] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. 2012: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2012 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney.[8] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. June 2011: Hazel Brionne Woodard apparently arranged for her son Mark James Jr. to vote at the polls in the name of his father, Mark James Sr., in the municipal runoff elections in Tarrant County, TX.[9] Nov. 2010: Four ballots may have been cast in the general election in South Carolina in the name of voters who had previously died (Ed Louis Johnson, Elbert R. Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable. (Law enforcement agents believe that the ballot of Elbert R. Thompson may have been confused with that of his son, Elbert Thompson.) Another 203 allegations of deceased voters in the same election were revealed to be either clerical error or coincidence.[10] May 2009: Lorenzo Antonio Almanza, Jr., after voting himself, apparently cast a ballot at the polls in the name of his incarcerated brother, Orlando Almanza, in the 2009 election for the Progreso Independent School District Board, TX. (His mother, Reyna Almanza, vouched for him, and was separately convicted.)[11] Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Forrest Downie in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Forrest Downie listed as dying 3 years earlier.[12] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Scott Hagloch in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Scott Hagloch listed as dying 2 years earlier.[13] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Mar. 2008: Jack Carol Crowder III allegedly impersonated his father (Jack Carol Crowder), using his father\u2019s voter registration card at the polls in the March 2008 presidential primary election in Baytown, TX.[14] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of James E. Barnes, who died in 2006. This may (or may not) have been the result of clerical error confusing the man with his son, James W. Barnes; it is not clear whether the pollbooks were reviewed to determine whether fraud or clerical error was the cause.[15] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of Stanley Dwayne Echols, who was at the hospital and did not vote.[16] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. June 2007: The two contending city council candidates in a municipal runoff election in Hoboken, NJ, both reported instances in the election in which someone went to the polls and found out that someone else had voted in their place.[17] It is not clear how many instances there were, or how the candidates learned of them. It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in a municipal budget referendum in Stonington, CT, in the name of Jane M. Drury, who died in 2000.[18] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Rosalie B. Simpson died in August 2004, but a vote was apparently recorded at the polls in her name in the general election in Seattle, WA.[19] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Frank Sanchez, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[20] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Someone apparently signed on the pollbook line for Rose-Mary G. McGee, in Albuquerque, NM, during the general election.[21] Nov. 2004: Dwight Adkins, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[22] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Three people at the polls in Westchester County, NY, were given provisional ballots (in New York, \u201caffidavit ballots\u201d) in the general election because someone had allegedly signed the poll books in their place.[23] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. Nov. 2004: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the general election in Milwaukee, WI, in the name of an individual who had died several years earlier.[24] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2004: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2004 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney. [25] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. Jan. 2004: Mark Lacasse apparently voted at the polls in the presidential primary in Londonderry, NH, in the name of his father, who was away on business at the time. [26] Nov. 2002: Shasta Nicole Crayton apparently voted in her sister\u2019s name at the polls in the general election in Dadeville, AL.[27] In several municipal, primary, and general elections in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, votes were cast in-person in Philadephia, PA, by an individual named Joseph Cheeseboro and by an individual named Joseph J. Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28] In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records. In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records. According to Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram, the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of four \u201crecent\u201d voters allegedly matched the corresponding information on earlier death certificates, indicating that the votes were cast after the individuals\u2019 deaths. It is not clear at which elections these votes were cast, or how many, if any, of these votes were cast at the polls (rather than absentee). It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.[31]\n\nCredible allegations of impersonation at the polls since 2000 that would not likely be prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls, or attempted impersonation at the polls since 2000 that was actually prevented without a strict ID requirement\n\n(Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)\n\nNov. 2012: Linda Earlette Wells apparently voted at the polls in the general election in Germantown, MD, in the name of her mother (Beatrice Moore Wells), who had died in June 2011. She apparently used her mother\u2019s ID to cast the ballot.[32] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Caitlin A. Legacki in the general election; Legacki was in Missouri at the time. However, in 2012, New Hampshire had a requirement that voters show photo ID at the polls; officials believe that either someone showed a fraudulent ID in Legacki\u2019s name or (according to them, more likely) that a clerical error incorrectly listed Legacki as voting.[33] Nov. 2010 (and Nov. 2008): Ortencia Segura-Segura apparently voted at the polls in the name of Marisela Reyna in the general elections in Reno, NV, using a fraudulently procured Nevada driver\u2019s license.[34] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Mar. 2010: Delores McMillian and her mother were both election officials in Dallas. During the primary election, McMillian used one other voter\u2019s registration number to try to cast a ballot in her name. (Her mother may have used more, but died during the course of the investigation.) A fellow election worker apparently blocked the attempt.[35] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. Nov. 2008 (and others): Mary Ann Comparin used a fake driver\u2019s license in the name of her long-dead sister, Norma Gerrish Collins, to vote in her sister\u2019s name in the 2008 general election in Bexar County, TX. [36] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2008: Ricardo Lopez-Munguia apparently voted (whether absentee or in person is not clear) in the name of Gustavo Carranza-Madrigal in the general election in Escondido, CA. Lopez-Munguia possessed a fraudulent California driver\u2019s license.[37] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: Andrea Pe\u00f1a was apparently recruited by mayor Omar Vela to vote in the school board election in Progreso, TX; Pe\u00f1a was apparently given someone else\u2019s voter registration card and told that pollworkers would make sure there were no problems. An election judge (more usually known as a pollworker) actually cast Pe\u00f1a\u2019s ballot for her.[38] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: in the same Progreso school board election, Jessica Rangel claimed that Guadalupe Vela Sr. tried to convince Rangel to recruit a friend to vote with someone else\u2019s voter registration card, and claimed that \u201cthey had people that worked the election on their side.\u201d Rangel apparently refused.[39] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Aug. 2007: Vancy Voorhies, a pollworker in Davidson County, TN, apparently voted at the polls in the mayoral election; at her ill elderly cousin\u2019s request, she signed her cousin\u2019s name in the pollbook (with her own initials to indicate the permission), asked her cousin how she preferred to vote, and cast the ballot accordingly.[40] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a misguided pollworker from casting invalid ballots. June 2007: A homeless man was apparently paid $10 to use the name of Kevin Logan to vote in a city council runoff race in Hoboken, NJ. After a challenge by a local resident, the effort failed. [41] Sept. 2005: Memphis, TN, pollworkers Verline Mayo, Gertrude Otteridge, and Mary McClatcher apparently cast at least three votes at the polls in the names of others, including two in the names of dead voters, in a special election for a state Senate seat.[42] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. May 2005: Macon, MS, resident Kendrick Slaughter testified that he saw Ike Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, urging Bridgette Brown to \u201cgo in [to the precinct pollsite] and vote, to use any name, and that no one was going to say anything.\u201d It is not clear whether Bridgette Brown did cast a vote at the polls in the name of another, but it is clear that pollworkers under Ike Brown\u2019s direction stood ready to commit or facilitate other forms of voter fraud.[43] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2000: A vote was cast in the general election in Miami, FL, in the name of Andre Alism\u00e9, who had died in 1997. The voter apparently used either a passport or driver\u2019s license and a voter registration card in Alism\u00e9\u2019s name.[44]\n\n[1] Jim Planck, Alleged Fraud Casts Pall Over Catskill School Vote, Daily Mail, May 29, 2014.\n\n[2] Alli Knothe, 2 Charged with Voter Fraud in Worcester, Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 4, 2013.\n\n[3] Max Rivlin-Nadler et al., Brazen Voting Fraud Alleged Among Ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, Gothamist, Sep. 11, 2013, http:\/\/gothamist.com\/2013\/09\/11\/voter_fraud_attempts.php.\n\n[4] Jason Noble, Schultz, Many Iowans Still Solidly Back Voter ID Laws, Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2013.\n\n[5] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[6] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[7] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[8] N.C.

    "text":"Marriott Wardman Park\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\n\n12:35 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Please have a seat. Well, good afternoon, and thank you to Dean Singleton and the board of the Associated Press for inviting me here today. It is a pleasure to speak to all of you -- and to have a microphone that I can see. (Laughter.) Feel free to transmit any of this to Vladimir if you see him. (Laughter.)\n\nClearly, we\u2019re already in the beginning months of another long, lively election year. There will be gaffes and minor controversies, be hot mics and Etch-a-Sketch moments. You will cover every word that we say, and we will complain vociferously about the unflattering words that you write -- unless, of course, you're writing about the other guy -- in which case, good job. (Laughter.)\n\nBut there are also big, fundamental issues at stake right now -- issues that deserve serious debate among every candidate, and serious coverage among every reporter. Whoever he may be, the next President will inherit an economy that is recovering, but not yet recovered, from the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression. Too many Americans will still be looking for a job that pays enough to cover their bills or their mortgage. Too many citizens will still lack the sort of financial security that started slipping away years before this recession hit. A debt that has grown over the last decade, primarily as a result of two wars, two massive tax cuts, and an unprecedented financial crisis, will have to be paid down.\n\nIn the face of all these challenges, we're going to have to answer a central question as a nation: What, if anything, can we do to restore a sense of security for people who are willing to work hard and act responsibly in this country? Can we succeed as a country where a shrinking number of people do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by? Or are we better off when everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules?\n\nThis is not just another run-of-the-mill political debate. I\u2019ve said it\u2019s the defining issue of our time, and I believe it. It\u2019s why I ran in 2008. It\u2019s what my presidency has been about. It\u2019s why I\u2019m running again. I believe this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and I can\u2019t remember a time when the choice between competing visions of our future has been so unambiguously clear.\n\nKeep in mind, I have never been somebody who believes that government can or should try to solve every problem. Some of you know my first job in Chicago was working with a group of Catholic churches that often did more good for the people in their communities than any government program could. In those same communities I saw that no education policy, however well crafted, can take the place of a parent\u2019s love and attention.\n\nAs President, I\u2019ve eliminated dozens of programs that weren\u2019t working, and announced over 500 regulatory reforms that will save businesses and taxpayers billions, and put annual domestic spending on a path to become the smallest share of the economy since Dwight Eisenhower held this office -- since before I was born. I know that the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector, not Washington, which is why I\u2019ve cut taxes for small business owners 17 times over the last three years.\n\nSo I believe deeply that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. My mother and the grandparents who raised me instilled the values of self-reliance and personal responsibility that remain the cornerstone of the American idea. But I also share the belief of our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln -- a belief that, through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves.\n\nThat belief is the reason this country has been able to build a strong military to keep us safe, and public schools to educate our children. That belief is why we\u2019ve been able to lay down railroads and highways to facilitate travel and commerce. That belief is why we\u2019ve been able to support the work of scientists and researchers whose discoveries have saved lives, and unleashed repeated technological revolutions, and led to countless new jobs and entire industries.\n\nThat belief is also why we\u2019ve sought to ensure that every citizen can count on some basic measure of security. We do this because we recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any moment, might face hard times, might face bad luck, might face a crippling illness or a layoff. And so we contribute to programs like Medicare and Social Security, which guarantee health care and a source of income after a lifetime of hard work. We provide unemployment insurance, which protects us against unexpected job loss and facilitates the labor mobility that makes our economy so dynamic. We provide for Medicaid, which makes sure that millions of seniors in nursing homes and children with disabilities are getting the care that they need.\n\nFor generations, nearly all of these investments -- from transportation to education to retirement programs -- have been supported by people in both parties. As much as we might associate the G.I. Bill with Franklin Roosevelt, or Medicare with Lyndon Johnson, it was a Republican, Lincoln, who launched the Transcontinental Railroad, the National Academy of Sciences, land grant colleges. It was Eisenhower who launched the Interstate Highway System and new investment in scientific research. It was Richard Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan who worked with Democrats to save Social Security. It was George W. Bush who added prescription drug coverage to Medicare.\n\n\n\nWhat leaders in both parties have traditionally understood is that these investments aren\u2019t part of some scheme to redistribute wealth from one group to another. They are expressions of the fact that we are one nation. These investments benefit us all. They contribute to genuine, durable economic growth.\n\nShow me a business leader who wouldn\u2019t profit if more Americans could afford to get the skills and education that today\u2019s jobs require. Ask any company where they\u2019d rather locate and hire workers \u2013- a country with crumbling roads and bridges, or one that\u2019s committed to high-speed Internet and high-speed railroads and high-tech research and development?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make us weaker when we guarantee basic security for the elderly or the sick or those who are actively looking for work. What makes us weaker is when fewer and fewer people can afford to buy the goods and services our businesses sell, or when entrepreneurs don\u2019t have the financial security to take a chance and start a new business. What drags down our entire economy is when there\u2019s an ever-widening chasm between the ultra-rich and everybody else.\n\nIn this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few. It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. That\u2019s how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known. That\u2019s why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so they could buy the cars that they made. That\u2019s why research has shown that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run.\n\nAnd yet, for much of the last century, we have been having the same argument with folks who keep peddling some version of trickle-down economics. They keep telling us that if we\u2019d convert more of our investments in education and research and health care into tax cuts -- especially for the wealthy -- our economy will grow stronger. They keep telling us that if we\u2019d just strip away more regulations, and let businesses pollute more and treat workers and consumers with impunity, that somehow we\u2019d all be better off. We\u2019re told that when the wealthy become even wealthier, and corporations are allowed to maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, it\u2019s good for America, and that their success will automatically translate into more jobs and prosperity for everybody else. That\u2019s the theory.\n\nNow, the problem for advocates of this theory is that we\u2019ve tried their approach -- on a massive scale. The results of their experiment are there for all to see. At the beginning of the last decade, the wealthiest Americans received a huge tax cut in 2001 and another huge tax cut in 2003. We were promised that these tax cuts would lead to faster job growth. They did not. The wealthy got wealthier -- we would expect that. The income of the top 1 percent has grown by more than 275 percent over the last few decades, to an average of $1.3 million a year. But prosperity sure didn't trickle down.\n\nInstead, during the last decade, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. And the typical American family actually saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent, even as the economy was growing.\n\nIt was a period when insurance companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions didn\u2019t have to abide by strong enough regulations, or they found their ways around them. And what was the result? Profits for many of these companies soared. But so did people\u2019s health insurance premiums. Patients were routinely denied care, often when they needed it most. Families were enticed, and sometimes just plain tricked, into buying homes they couldn\u2019t afford. Huge, reckless bets were made with other people\u2019s money on the line. And our entire financial system was nearly destroyed.\n\nSo we tried this theory out. And you would think that after the results of this experiment in trickle-down economics, after the results were made painfully clear, that the proponents of this theory might show some humility, might moderate their views a bit. You'd think they\u2019d say, you know what, maybe some rules and regulations are necessary to protect the economy and prevent people from being taken advantage of by insurance companies or credit card companies or mortgage lenders. Maybe, just maybe, at a time of growing debt and widening inequality, we should hold off on giving the wealthiest Americans another round of big tax cuts. Maybe when we know that most of today\u2019s middle-class jobs require more than a high school degree, we shouldn\u2019t gut education, or lay off thousands of teachers, or raise interest rates on college loans, or take away people\u2019s financial aid.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the opposite of what they\u2019ve done. Instead of moderating their views even slightly, the Republicans running Congress right now have doubled down, and proposed a budget so far to the right it makes the Contract with America look like the New Deal. (Laughter.) In fact, that renowned liberal, Newt Gingrich, first called the original version of the budget \"radical\" and said it would contribute to \"right-wing social engineering.\" This is coming from Newt Gingrich.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, this isn\u2019t a budget supported by some small rump group in the Republican Party. This is now the party\u2019s governing platform. This is what they\u2019re running on. One of my potential opponents, Governor Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced as a bill on day one of his presidency. He said that he\u2019s \u201cvery supportive\u201d of this new budget, and he even called it \"marvelous\" -- which is a word you don\u2019t often hear when it comes to describing a budget. (Laughter.) It\u2019s a word you don\u2019t often hear generally. (Laughter.)\n\nSo here\u2019s what this \"marvelous\" budget does. Back in the summer, I came to an agreement with Republicans in Congress to cut roughly $1 trillion in annual spending. Some of these cuts were about getting rid of waste; others were about programs that we support but just can\u2019t afford given our deficits and our debt. And part of the agreement was a guarantee of another trillion in savings, for a total of about $2 trillion in deficit reduction.\n\nThis new House Republican budget, however, breaks our bipartisan agreement and proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending \u2013- exactly the area where we\u2019ve already cut the most. And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly. So bear with me. I want to go through this -- because I don\u2019t think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget.\n\nThe year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each. There would be 1,600 fewer medical grants, research grants for things like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer and AIDS. There would be 4,000 fewer scientific research grants, eliminating support for 48,000 researchers, students, and teachers. Investments in clean energy technologies that are helping us reduce our dependence on foreign oil would be cut by nearly a fifth.\n\nIf this budget becomes law and the cuts were applied evenly, starting in 2014, over 200,000 children would lose their chance to get an early education in the Head Start program. Two million mothers and young children would be cut from a program that gives them access to healthy food. There would be 4,500 fewer federal grants at the Department of Justice and the FBI to combat violent crime, financial crime, and help secure our borders. Hundreds of national parks would be forced to close for part or all of the year. We wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to enforce the laws that protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the food that we eat.\n\nCuts to the FAA would likely result in more flight cancellations, delays, and the complete elimination of air traffic control services in parts of the country. Over time, our weather forecasts would become less accurate because we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to launch new satellites. And that means governors and mayors would have to wait longer to order evacuations in the event of a hurricane.\n\nThat\u2019s just a partial sampling of the consequences of this budget. Now, you can anticipate Republicans may say, well, we\u2019ll avoid some of these cuts -- since they don\u2019t specify exactly the cuts that they would make. But they can only avoid some of these cuts if they cut even deeper in other areas. This is math. If they want to make smaller cuts to medical research that means they\u2019ve got to cut even deeper in funding for things like teaching and law enforcement. The converse is true as well. If they want to protect early childhood education, it will mean further reducing things like financial aid for young people trying to afford college.\n\nPerhaps they will never tell us where the knife will fall -- but you can be sure that with cuts this deep, there is no secret plan or formula that will be able to protect the investments we need to help our economy grow.\n\nThis is not conjecture. I am not exaggerating. These are facts. And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next.\n\nIf this budget became law, by the middle of the century, funding for the kinds of things I just mentioned would have to be cut by about 95 percent. Let me repeat that. Those categories I just mentioned we would have to cut by 95 percent. As a practical matter, the federal budget would basically amount to whatever is left in entitlements, defense spending, and interest on the national debt -- period. Money for these investments that have traditionally been supported on a bipartisan basis would be practically eliminated.\n\nAnd the same is true for other priorities like transportation, and homeland security, and veterans programs for the men and women who have risked their lives for this country. This is not an exaggeration. Check it out yourself.\n\nAnd this is to say nothing about what the budget does to health care. We\u2019re told that Medicaid would simply be handed over to the states -- that's the pitch: Let's get it out of the central bureaucracy. The states can experiment. They'll be able to run the programs a lot better. But here's the deal the states would be getting. They would have to be running these programs in the face of the largest cut to Medicaid that has ever been proposed -- a cut that, according to one nonpartisan group, would take away health care for about 19 million Americans -- 19 million.\n\nWho are these Americans? Many are someone\u2019s grandparents who, without Medicaid, won't be able to afford nursing home care without Medicaid. Many are poor children. Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Down\u2019s Syndrome. Some are kids with disabilities so severe that they require 24-hour care. These are the people who count on Medicaid.\n\nThen there\u2019s Medicare. Because health care costs keep rising and the Baby Boom generation is retiring, Medicare, we all know, is one of the biggest drivers of our long-term deficit. That\u2019s a challenge we have to meet by bringing down the cost of health care overall so that seniors and taxpayers can share in the savings.\n\nBut here\u2019s the solution proposed by the Republicans in Washington, and embraced by most of their candidates for president: Instead of being enrolled in Medicare when they turn 65, seniors who retire a decade from now would get a voucher that equals the cost of the second cheapest health care plan in their area. If Medicare is more expensive than that private plan, they\u2019ll have to pay more if they want to enroll in traditional Medicare. If health care costs rise faster than the amount of the voucher -- as, by the way, they\u2019ve been doing for decades -- that\u2019s too bad. Seniors bear the risk. If the voucher isn\u2019t enough to buy a private plan with the specific doctors and care that you need, that's too bad.\n\nSo most experts will tell you the way this voucher plan encourages savings is not through better care at cheaper cost. The way these private insurance companies save money is by designing and marketing plans to attract the youngest and healthiest seniors -- cherry-picking -- leaving the older and sicker seniors in traditional Medicare, where they have access to a wide range of doctors and guaranteed care. But that, of course, makes the traditional Medicare program even more expensive, and raise premiums even further.\n\nThe net result is that our country will end up spending more on health care, and the only reason the government will save any money -- it won\u2019t be on our books -- is because we\u2019ve shifted it to seniors. They\u2019ll bear more of the costs themselves. It\u2019s a bad idea, and it will ultimately end Medicare as we know it.\n\nNow, the proponents of this budget will tell us we have to make all these draconian cuts because our deficit is so large; this is an existential crisis, we have to think about future generations, so on and so on. And that argument might have a shred of credibility were it not for their proposal to also spend $4.6 trillion over the next decade on lower tax rates.\n\nWe\u2019re told that these tax cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating wasteful deductions. But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close. Not one. And by the way, there is no way to get even close to $4.6 trillion in savings without dramatically reducing all kinds of tax breaks that go to middle-class families -- tax breaks for health care, tax breaks for retirement, tax breaks for homeownership.\n\nMeanwhile, these proposed tax breaks would come on top of more than a trillion dollars in tax giveaways for people making more than $250,000 a year. That\u2019s an average of at least $150,000 for every millionaire in this country -- $150,000.\n\nLet\u2019s just step back for a second and look at what $150,000 pays for: A year\u2019s worth of prescription drug coverage for a senior citizen. Plus a new school computer lab. Plus a year of medical care for a returning veteran. Plus a medical research grant for a chronic disease. Plus a year\u2019s salary for a firefighter or police officer. Plus a tax credit to make a year of college more affordable. Plus a year\u2019s worth of financial aid. One hundred fifty thousand dollars could pay for all of these things combined -- investments in education and research that are essential to economic growth that benefits all of us. For $150,000, that would be going to each millionaire and billionaire in this country. This budget says we\u2019d be better off as a country if that\u2019s how we spend it.\n\nThis is supposed to be about paying down our deficit? It\u2019s laughable.\n\nThe bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission that I created -- which the Republicans originally were for until I was for it -- that was about paying down the deficit. And I didn\u2019t agree with all the details. I proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and $600 billion -- I'm sorry -- it proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and about $600 billion more in defense cuts than I proposed in my own budget. But Bowles-Simpson was a serious, honest, balanced effort between Democrats and Republicans to bring down the deficit. That\u2019s why, although it differs in some ways, my budget takes a similarly balanced approach: Cuts in discretionary spending, cuts in mandatory spending, increased revenue.\n\nThis congressional Republican budget is something different altogether. It is a Trojan Horse. Disguised as deficit reduction plans, it is really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country. It is thinly veiled social Darwinism. It is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everybody who\u2019s willing to work for it; a place where prosperity doesn\u2019t trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class. And by gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that\u2019s built to last -- education and training, research and development, our infrastructure -- it is a prescription for decline.\n\nAnd everybody here should understand that because there's very few people here who haven't benefitted at some point from those investments that were made in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s and the '80s. That\u2019s part of how we got ahead. And now, we're going to be pulling up those ladders up for the next generation?\n\nSo in the months ahead, I will be fighting as hard as I know how for this truer vision of what the United States of America is all about. Absolutely, we have to get serious about the deficit. And that will require tough choices and sacrifice. And I\u2019ve already shown myself willing to make these tough choices when I signed into law the biggest spending cut of any President in recent memory. In fact, if you adjust for the economy, the Congressional Budget Office says the overall spending next year will be lower than any year under Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnd I\u2019m willing to make more of those difficult spending decisions in the months ahead. But I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again -- there has to be some balance. All of us have to do our fair share.\n\nI\u2019ve also put forward a detailed plan that would reform and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid. By the beginning of the next decade, it achieves the same amount of annual health savings as the plan proposed by Simpson-Bowles -- the Simpson-Bowles commission, and it does so by making changes that people in my party haven\u2019t always been comfortable with. But instead of saving money by shifting costs to seniors, like the congressional Republican plan proposes, our approach would lower the cost of health care throughout the entire system. It goes after excessive subsidies to prescription drug companies. It gets more efficiency out of Medicaid without gutting the program. It asks the very wealthiest seniors to pay a little bit more. It changes the way we pay for health care -- not by procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to improve their results.\n\nAnd it slows the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission -- a commission not made up of bureaucrats from government or insurance companies, but doctors and nurses and medical experts and consumers, who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best way to reduce unnecessary health care spending while protecting access to the care that the seniors need.\n\nWe also have a much different approach when it comes to taxes -- an approach that says if we\u2019re serious about paying down our debt, we can\u2019t afford to spend trillions more on tax cuts for folks like me, for wealthy Americans who don\u2019t need them and weren\u2019t even asking for them, and that the country cannot afford. At a time when the share of national income flowing to the top 1 percent of people in this country has climbed to levels last seen in the 1920s, those same folks are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years. As both I and Warren Buffett have pointed out many times now, he\u2019s paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. That is not fair. It is not right.\n\nAnd the choice is really very simple. If you want to keep these tax rates and deductions in place -- or give even more tax breaks to the wealthy, as the Republicans in Congress propose -- then one of two things happen: Either it means higher deficits, or it means more sacrifice from the middle class. Seniors will have to pay more for Medicare. College students will lose some of their financial aid. Working families who are scraping by will have to do more because the richest Americans are doing less. I repeat what I\u2019ve said before: That is not class warfare, that is not class envy, that is math.\n\nIf that\u2019s the choice that members of Congress want to make, then we\u2019re going to make sure every American knows about it. In a few weeks, there will be a vote on what we\u2019ve called the Buffett Rule. Simple concept: If you make more than a million dollars a year -- not that you have a million dollars -- if you make more than a million dollars annually, then you should pay at least the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle-class families do. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year -- like 98 percent of American families do -- then your taxes shouldn\u2019t go up. That\u2019s the proposal.\n\nNow, you\u2019ll hear some people point out that the Buffett Rule alone won\u2019t raise enough revenue to solve our deficit problems. Maybe not, but it\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction. And I intend to keep fighting for this kind of balance and fairness until the other side starts listening, because I believe this is what the American people want. I believe this is the best way to pay for the investments we need to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class. And by the way, I believe it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nThis larger debate that we will be having and that you will be covering in the coming year about the size and role of government, this debate has been with us since our founding days. And during moments of great challenge and change, like the ones that we\u2019re living through now, the debate gets sharper; it gets more vigorous. That\u2019s a good thing. As a country that prizes both our individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is one of the most important debates that we can have.\n\nBut no matter what we argue or where we stand, we have always held certain beliefs as Americans. We believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and pursue our own happiness, we can\u2019t just think about ourselves. We have to think about the country that made those liberties possible. We have to think about our fellow citizens with whom we share a community. We have to think about what\u2019s required to preserve the American Dream for future generations.\n\nAnd this sense of responsibility -- to each other and our country -- this isn\u2019t a partisan feeling. This isn\u2019t a Democratic or Republican idea. It\u2019s patriotism. And if we keep that in mind, and uphold our obligations to one another and to this larger enterprise that is America, then I have no doubt that we will continue our long and prosperous journey as the greatest nation on Earth.\n\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you.\n\nMR. SINGLETON: Thank you, Mr. President. We appreciate so much you being with us today. I have some questions from the audience, which I will ask -- and I'll be more careful than I was last time I did this.\n\nRepublicans have been sharply critical of your budget ideas as well. What can you say to the Americans who just want both sides to stop fighting and get some work done on their behalf?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I completely understand the American people\u2019s frustrations, because the truth is that these are eminently solvable problems. I know that Christine Lagarde is here from the IMF, and she\u2019s looking at the books of a lot of other countries around the world. The kinds of challenges they face fiscally are so much more severe than anything that we confront -- if we make some sensible decisions.\n\nSo the American people\u2019s impulses are absolutely right. These are solvable problems if people of good faith came together and were willing to compromise. The challenge we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook no compromise. And this is not just my assertion. We had presidential candidates who stood on a stage and were asked, \u201cWould you accept a budget package, a deficit reduction plan, that involved $10 of cuts for every dollar in revenue increases?\u201d Ten-to-one ratio of spending cuts to revenue. Not one of them raised their hand.\n\nThink about that. Ronald Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases. Did it multiple times. He could not get through a Republican primary today.\n\nSo let's look at Bowles-Simpson. Essentially, my differences with Bowles-Simpson were I actually proposed less revenue and slightly lower defense spending cuts. The Republicans want to increase defense spending and take in no revenue, which makes it impossible to balance the deficit under the terms that Bowles-Simpson laid out -- unless you essentially eliminate discretionary spending. You don't just cut discretionary spending. Everything we think of as being pretty important -- from education to basic science and research to transportation spending to national parks to environmental protection -- we'd essentially have to eliminate.\n\nI guess another way of thinking about this is -- and this bears on your reporting. I think that there is oftentimes the impulse to suggest that if the two parties are disagreeing, then they're equally at fault and the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and an equivalence is presented -- which reinforces I think people's cynicism about Washington generally. This is not one of those situations where there's an equivalence. I've got some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress who were prepared to make significant changes to entitlements that go against their political interests, and who said they were willing to do it. And we couldn't get a Republican to stand up and say, we'll raise some revenue, or even to suggest that we won't give more tax cuts to people who don't need them.\n\nAnd so I think it's important to put the current debate in some historical context. It's not just true, by the way, of the budget. It's true of a lot of the debates that we're having out here.\n\nCap and trade was originally proposed by conservatives and Republicans as a market-based solution to solving environmental problems. The first President to talk about cap and trade was George H.W. Bush. Now you've got the other party essentially saying we shouldn\u2019t even be thinking about environmental protection; let's gut the EPA.\n\nHealth care, which is in the news right now -- there's a reason why there's a little bit of confusion in the Republican primary about health care and the individual mandate since it originated as a conservative idea to preserve the private marketplace in health care while still assuring that everybody got covered, in contrast to a single-payer plan. Now, suddenly, this is some socialist overreach.\n\nSo as all of you are doing your reporting, I think it's important to remember that the positions I'm taking now on the budget and a host of other issues, if we had been having this discussion 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago, would have been considered squarely centrist positions. What's changed is the center of the Republican Party. And that\u2019s certainly true with the budget.\n\nMR. SINGLETON: Mr. President, the managing director of the (inaudible) for continuation of United States leadership (inaudible) economic issues, and underscored the need for a lower deficit and lower debt. How can you respond to that claim?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, she's absolutely right. It's interesting, when I travel around the world at these international fora -- and I've said this before -- the degree to which America is still the one indispensable nation, the degree to which, even as other countries are rising and their economies are expanding, we are still looked to for leadership, for agenda setting -- not just because of our size, not just because of our military power, but because there is a sense that unlike most superpowers in the past, we try to set out a set of universal rules, a set of principles by which everybody can benefit.\n\nAnd that\u2019s true on the economic front as well. We continue to be the world\u2019s largest market, an important engine for economic growth. We can\u2019t return to a time when by simply borrowing and consuming, we end up driving global economic growth.\n\nI said this a few months after I was elected at the first G20 summit. I said the days when Americans using their credit cards and home equity loans finance the rest of the world\u2019s growth by taking in imports from every place else -- those days are over. On the other hand, we continue to be a extraordinarily important market and foundation for global economic growth.\n\nWe do have to take care of our deficits. I think Christine has spoken before, and I think most economists would argue as well, that the challenge when it comes to our deficits is not short-term discretionary spending, which is manageable. As I said before and I want to repeat, as a percentage of our GDP, our discretionary spending -- all the things that the Republicans are proposing cutting -- is actually lower than it's been since Dwight Eisenhower. There has not been some massive expansion of social programs, programs that help the poor, environmental programs, education programs. That\u2019s not our problem.\n\nOur problem is that our revenue has dropped down to between 15 and 16 percent -- far lower than it has been historically, certainly far lower than it was under Ronald Reagan -- at the same time as our health care costs have surged, and our demographics mean that there is more and more pressure being placed on financing our Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs.\n\nSo at a time when the recovery is still gaining steam, and unemployment is still very high, the solution should be pretty apparent. And that is even as we continue to make investments in growth today -- for example, putting some of our construction workers back to work rebuilding schools and roads and bridges, or helping states to rehire teachers at a time when schools are having a huge difficulty retaining quality teachers in the classroom -- all of which would benefit our economy, we focus on a long-term plan to stabilize our revenues at a responsible level and to deal with our health care programs in a responsible way. And that's exactly what I'm proposing.\n\nAnd what we've proposed is let's go back, for folks who are making more than $250,000 a year, to levels that were in place during the Clinton era, when wealthy people were doing just fine, and the economy was growing a lot stronger than it did after they were cut. And let's take on Medicare and Medicaid in a serious way -- which is not just a matter of taking those costs off the books, off the federal books, and pushing them onto individual seniors, but let's actually reduce health care costs. Because we spend more on health care with not as good outcomes as any other advanced, developed nation on Earth.\n\nAnd that would seem to be a sensible proposal. The problem right now is not the technical means to solve it. The problem is our politics. And that's part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about, is, are we, as a country, willing to get back to common-sense, balanced, fair solutions that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget. And it can be done.\n\nOne last point I want to make, Dean, that I think is important, because it goes to the growth issue. If state and local government hiring were basically on par to what our current recovery -- on par to past recoveries, the unemployment rate would probably be about a point lower than it is right now. If the construction industry were going through what we normally go through, that would be another point lower. The challenge we have right now -- part of the challenge we have in terms of growth has to do with the very specific issues of huge cuts in state and local government, and the housing market still recovering from this massive bubble. And that -- those two things are huge headwinds in terms of growth.\n\nI say this because if we, for example, put some of those construction workers back to work, or we put some of those teachers back in the classroom, that could actually help create the kind of virtuous cycle that would bring in more revenues just because of economic growth, would benefit the private sector in significant ways. And that could help contribute to deficit reduction in the short term, even as we still have to do these important changes to our health care programs over the long term.\n\nMR. SINGLETON: Mr. President, you said yesterday that it would be unprecedented for a Supreme Court to overturn laws passed by an elected Congress. But that is exactly what the Court has done during its entire existence. If the Court were to overturn individual mandate, what would you do, or propose to do, for the 30 million people who wouldn\u2019t have health care after that ruling?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let me be very specific. We have not seen a Court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on a economic issue, like health care, that I think most people would clearly consider commerce -- a law like that has not been overturned at least since Lochner. Right? So we\u2019re going back to the \u201930s, pre New Deal.\n\nAnd the point I was making is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws, and all of us have to respect it, but it\u2019s precisely because of that extraordinary power that the Court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress. And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this.\n\nNow, as I said, I expect the Supreme Court actually to recognize that and to abide by well-established precedence out there. I have enormous confidence that in looking at this law, not only is it constitutional, but that the Court is going to exercise its jurisprudence carefully because of the profound power that our Supreme Court has. As a consequence, we\u2019re not spending a whole bunch of time planning for contingencies.\n\nWhat I did emphasize yesterday is there is a human element to this that everybody has to remember. This is not an abstract exercise. I get letters every day from people who are affected by the health care law right now, even though it\u2019s not fully implemented. Young people who are 24, 25, who say, you know what, I just got diagnosed with a tumor. First of all, I would not have gone to get a check-up if I hadn\u2019t had health insurance. Second of all, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to get it treated had I not been on my parent\u2019s plan. Thank you and thank Congress for getting this done.\n\nI get letters from folks who have just lost their job, their COBRA is running out. They\u2019re in the middle of treatment for colon cancer or breast cancer, and they\u2019re worried when their COBRA runs out, if they\u2019re still sick, what are they going to be able to do because they\u2019re not going to be able to get health insurance.\n\nAnd the point I think that was made very ably before the Supreme Court, but I think most health care economists who have looked at this have acknowledged, is there are basically two ways to cover people with preexisting conditions or assure that people can always get coverage even when they had bad illnesses. One way is the single-payer plan -- everybody is under a single system, like Medicare. The other way is to set up a system in which you don\u2019t have people who are healthy but don\u2019t bother to get health insurance, and then we all have to pay for them in the emergency room.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t work, and so, as a consequence, we've got to make sure that those folks are taking their responsibility seriously, which is what the individual mandate does.\n\nSo I don\u2019t anticipate the Court striking this down. I think they take their responsibilities very seriously. But I think what's more important is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to recognize that in a country like ours -- the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth -- we shouldn\u2019t have a system in which millions of people are at risk of bankruptcy because they get sick, or end up waiting until they do get sick and then go to the emergency room, which involves all of us paying for it.\n\nMR. SINGLETON: Mr. President, you've been very, very generous with your time, and we appreciate very much you being here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you.\n\nEND\n\n1:35 P.M. EDT",

That was you, it was Robert Gibbs, and the State Department, who really saved them --- and we all thank you very much.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, listen, those guys showed enormous courage, as so many journalists do around the world. And so, not only was it important for us to make sure they were safe for them and their families, but to uphold the basic principle of free speech and freedom of the press. That's a universal value we cared about. And I know FOX cares about. So, I'm just glad these guys are --\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Those guys could have died.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: And I just want everybody to know that, you know, the State Department really saved them.\n\n\n\nAll right. Mubarak, is he going to leave soon?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, he's -- only he knows what he's going to do.\n\n\n\nBut here's what we know: is that Egypt is not going to go back to what it was. The Egyptian people want freedom. They want free and fair elections. They want a representative government. They want a responsive government.\n\n\n\nAnd so, what we've said is: you have to start a transition now. Mubarak has already decided he's not running for re-election again. His term is up this year. And what we've said is: let's make sure that you get all the groups together in Egypt, let Egyptian people make a determination on what's the process for an orderly transition, but one that is a meaningful transition and that leads to a government that's --\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: So, you don't know when he's going to leave?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, you know, ultimately, the United States can't absolute dictate --\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You can't force him to leave.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: But what we can do, Bill, is we can say that, \"The time is now for you to start making a change in that country.\"\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: He's already done that. But the longer he stays in, the more people are going to die. And the other problem is, Mubarak knows a lot of bad things about the United States. I'm sure you're aware of that. OBAMA: Well, let me say this: the United States and Egypt have been a partner for a long time.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Right. He's done the bad things.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: He's been a good partner when it comes to the peace with Israel. There have been counterterrorism efforts that he's been very supported of. But we've also said consistently said to him both publicly and privately is that trying to suppress your own people is something that is not sustainable. And part of the message that I think we're seeing all around the world is, when you resort to suppression, when you resort to violence, that does not work.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Yes, but it worked for 30 years. So, he had his run. But he knows a lot of bad things about us, rendition and all of that. And I'm sure you know that. So, I'm just worried that he might go off the reservation.\n\n\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, a great concern to a lot of people. Are they a threat to the USA?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I think that the Muslim Brotherhood is one faction in Egypt. They don't have majority support in Egypt. They are --\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Are they a threat?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: But they are well-organized and there are strains of their ideology that are anti-U.S. There's no doubt about it. But here's the thing that we have to understand, there are a whole bunch of secular folks in Egypt, there are a whole bunch of educators and civil society in Egypt that wants to come to the fore as well. And it's important for us not the say that our only two options are either the Muslim Brotherhood or a suppressed Egyptian people.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: But you don't wan the Muslim Brotherhood...\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What I want a representative government in Egypt. And I have confidence that if Egypt moves in an orderly transition process, that we will have a government in Egypt that we can work with together as a partner.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I hope so. Those are tough boys, the Muslim Brotherhood. I wouldn't want them anywhere near that government. Federal judge in Florida said, your health care law is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court may follow on that, it's going to be very close. Are you prepared for that law to go down?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think the judge in Florida was wrong. Keep in mind that we've had 12 judges said -- that just threw this case out -- the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: But it goes to the Supremes now.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, it first it goes to the appellate court -- there's district court, then there are appeal courts, and then it goes to the Supreme Court. But here's the key point, Bill, and I said this in the State of the Union, I don't want to spend the next two years refighting the battles of the last two years.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Yeah, but you're going have to.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I don't think that's...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: The Supreme Court is going to hear this one way or the other.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What the American have said is we want cost controls in health care, we want security in health care. What I've said to the Republicans is if you have ideas in terms of improving the health care system, if you have ideas that I can embrace on things like...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: They're not going to bother with it, though. They're going wait until it goes to the court and hope it thrown out 5-4. My question is are you prepared if it gets thrown out? What are you going to do?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Here's what I'm not prepared to do, I'm not prepared to go back to a day when the American people if you have got a pre-existing condition, if you had a heart attack then you can't get help.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Here's what the Wall Street Journal said, I want you to react to this. Mr. Obama is a determined man of the left whose goal is to redistribute much larger levels of income across society. He may give tactical ground when he has to, as he did on taxes to avoid a middle class tax increase, but he will resist to his last day any major changes to Obamacare and the other load-bearing walls of the entitlement state.\n\n\n\nThis is The Wall Street Journal you know painting you as pretty left-wing guy. Are you going to go along?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, the Wall Street Journal probably would paint you as a left-wing guy. I mean, if you're talking about the Wall Street Journal editorial page...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I've got to tell you, that's what this is.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, that's like quoting the New York Times editorial...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Do you deny the assessment? Do you deny that you are a man who wants to redistribute wealth.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You deny that?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely. I didn't raise taxes once, I lowered taxes over the last two years.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: But the entitlements that you championed do redistribute wealth in the sense that they provide insurance coverage for 40 million people that don't have it.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What is absolutely true is I think in this country, there's no reason why, if you get sick you should go bankrupt. The notion that that's a radical principle, I don't think the majority of people would agree with you.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Then why do the majority people in the polls not support Obamacare?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Actually, I think it's pretty evenly divided.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: It's close.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: It's evenly divided, Bill. And here's what I think a lot of people saw, over the last two years, at a time when people were concerned about the economy and about jobs, what they saw was a lot of arguing in congress, which is what they always see is a lot of arguing in congress. And they don't like the process and they felt that our focus wasn't on what they're focused on, which is how to win the future, how to make sure that jobs are right here in the United States of America. How are we building a competitive society at a time when we're losing jobs.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Yeah, some people see it that way, but other people see it's a huge government intrusion and you guy just want to take over, basically, decision making for Americans. It's an ideological argument.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: But, Bill, I just want to be clear about this, because if you look what we have done, what we said was, if you have health care that you like, you keep it.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I know all that. I listen to it every day.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I know. And I listen to you. And what I hear you saying, Bill, for example, is that the notion that us saying to people that don't have health insurance, don't make me pay for your health insurance, if you get sick, you have a responsibility to make sure that you have got coverage. There's nothing socialist about that, that's saying to Americans, we're going each of us be responsible for our own health care. And that's something that I think that the majority of Americans...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: OK, but you understand that a lot of Americans feel you're a big government liberal who wants to intrude on their personal freedom. Now, they also say that you have been moving -- now, that's -- come on, you know that...\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I think that a lot of folks who watch you don't believe that.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: They think way worse than me.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: And I give you credit, you've got a pretty big viewership, so you can be persuasive.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: But the pundits now say you're moving to the center to raise your approval, is that true, are you moving to the center?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: No? Because we were set up over there, and then they moved you a little to the center.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: (Laughs) Here's what I think is true. Over the first two years of my presidency, we had a complete disaster. Right? We had a complete crisis. The financial markets were breaking down. We were slipping into a Great Depression. And we had to take a bunch of extraordinary steps in order to make sure that the economy was growing again, which it is now, growing. Making sure that the private sector was creating jobs again. It's now doing that.\n\n\n\nAnd now our focus is not on refighting the battle of the last two years...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: So you're not moving to the center?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I haven't -- I didn't move to...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You haven't moved anywhere? You're the same guy?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I'm the same guy. My practical focus, my common-sense focus right now is how to we out-innovate, out-educate, out-building, out-compete the rest of the world? How do we create jobs here in the United States of America? How do we make sure that businesses are thriving? But how do we also -- making sure that ordinary Americans can live out the American dream?\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Listen, I hope you can do it.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Because right now, they don't feel like they are.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I hope you can do it.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I know you do.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Americans need to be secure in their lives.\n\n\n\nOK. Worst part of this job? What's the worst, absolute worst part of being president of the United States?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Worst part of the job is, first of all, I've got a jacket on on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: That's true.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: If I wasn't president, that would not be happening.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I have a tie. You don't have a tie.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: The biggest problem for me is being in the bubble. It's very hard to escape. You know, you can't go to the corner...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Everybody watching every move you make.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Every move you make. And you -- over time, you know, what happens is you feel like -- that you're not able to just have a spontaneous conversation with folks.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Yes. OBAMA: And that's a loss. That's a big loss.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: What is it about the job that has surprised you the most? That you weren't prepared for coming in here?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, I think that the thing you understand intellectually, but you don't understand in your gut until you're in the job, is that every decision that comes to my desk is something that nobody else has been able to solve. The easy stuff gets solved somewhere by somebody else. By the time it gets to me, you don't have easy answers. You don't have the best...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: So it's like wave after wave of complicated problems and there you are.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Complicated problems. Yes. And well, you have to make your best judgment about this is probably our best approach for the American people. But you know that you don't have perfect information, and you know that you're not going to have a perfect solution.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Give it your best shot.\n\n\n\nNow, people who know you have told me that you've changed a little bit since you've become president.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I'm a lot grayer. That's for sure.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Every president does. But have you -- do you think you have changed as a person since you have become president?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I think if you asked Michelle, who knows me best, I think -- or my closest friends, I think they'd say I'm basically the same guy as when I came in.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Can I tell you what they say?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What do they say?\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You're much more guarded.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think what is true is that, when you're in this job, everything you say could affect markets. It could affect...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I know that. Even on a personal level. Some people who know you say, you know, he's not -- he doesn't have the -- the -- he's not as light as he used to be; he's not as spontaneous.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, that -- look...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Preoccupied?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I would say -- I would say that's probably true. I mean, look, there's no doubt that the weight of the office has an impact.\n\n\n\nBut I will tell you that the longer I'm in this job, the more I enjoy it. The more optimistic I am about the American people. The more optimistic I am about this country. There's something about this position that gives you a pretty good vantage point of the country as a whole. And for all the arguing that we get into and all the debates between Democrats and Republicans...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: A tremendous country. Right? It is.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: There's just a sense -- there's a common sense and a decency to the American people that makes me optimistic even on the worst of days.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I asked this to President Bush when I talked to him a few weeks ago. Does it disturb you that so many people hate you? No. I mean, it's a serious question.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, the truth is, that the people -- and I'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody. The people who dislike you don't know you.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: They hate you.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Even -- the folks who hate you, they don't know you.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: That's true.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that's out there. And they don't know you. And so, you don't take it personally.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: No. You don't ever?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: No. Because you know that if you just...\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Doesn't it annoy you sometimes?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, look, I think that by the time you get here, you have to have had a pretty thick skin. If you didn't, then you probably wouldn't have gotten here. O'REILLY: FOX Sports has the Super Bowl tonight. You know, they're charging an enormous amount of money for it. And they're going to make a fortune. They pay all my expenses here. Who's going to win the game? Come on! Come on, come on.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Bill, here's the thing. Once my Bears lost, I don't pick sides.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: So, you don't care?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I do care. I want -- I want a great game. I want a great game.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You don't care who wins?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: But these are pretty evenly matched teams. You know, I think that, you know, Green Bay is probably a little faster. Steelers got a little more experience. I think the Steelers not having their starting center is something they've got to be worried about.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Now, will you actually watch the game?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Because I know there's a party here. J. Lo is going to be here, which is why I have to get out of here because I'll frighten her if she comes in.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You're invited there.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: No, I know I'm not.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You have to take off the tie.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I don't want the ruin the party for you guys.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, barbecue --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: But are you going to watch the game? Are you going to --\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Of course. I'll watch the game.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Are you going to sit and you're going to watch?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I'm not going to --\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You know, like, football, you know, like, blitzes and coverage and all that?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Oh, I know football, man.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: You do?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: I know you're a basketball guy.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I know football.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Yes?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I know football and I will watch the game. What happens is I schmooze with everybody when they come.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Yes?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Give them a little bit of time. But once the game starts, they can just sit and watch the game.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: And you're out there?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, no, I'll be sitting there with them, but I don't want them coming up chitting and chatting.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: All right.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: We got to focus on football.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Well, that's our live part of this deal. And I have to say, I enjoyed talking to you. I disagree with you sometimes. I hope you think I'm fair to you, I try to be. But I wish you well in the next two years.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Bill, it's always a pleasure. I enjoyed it.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: It's nice to see you.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: And we are going have more with the president, by the way, on THE FACTOR starting on Monday, going to do a little bit more Q and A.\n\n\n\nSo, enjoy the game.\n\n\n\nEND\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 06, 2011 17:49 ET\n\nSource: CQ Transcriptions\n\n\u00a9 2011, Congressional Quarterly Inc., All Rights Reserved",

    "text":"Denver CNN \u2014\n\nThe following is a transcript of Wednesday night\u2019s presidential debate in Denver.\n\n21:01:40: JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. I\u2019m Jim Lehrer of the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\n\nThis debate and the next three \u2013 two presidential, one vice presidential \u2013 are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\u2019s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\n\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.\n\nThe segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.\n\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent \u2013 no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let\u2019s start the economy, segment one, and let\u2019s begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\n\nYou have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\n\n21:04:24: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\n\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\n\nAnd so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.\n\nAnd because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.\n\nBut we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going.\n\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view.\n\nI think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\n\nNow, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2013 to you \u2013 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate.\n\n21: 06:31: LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\n\n21:06:32: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It\u2019s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I\u2019m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\n\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2013 here with me. So I\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d\n\nAnn yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do.\n\nMy plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.\n\nNumber two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.\n\nNumber three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now.\n\nNumber four, get to us a balanced budget.\n\nNumber five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.\n\nNow, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2013 if you will, trickle-down government \u2013 would work.\n\nThat\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\n\n21:08:40: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down \u2013 his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.\n\n21:08:50: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.\n\nSo now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\n\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\n\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\n\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?\n\nAnd this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2013 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2013 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2013 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\n21:11:03: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we\u2019re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.\n\nBut, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you\u2019d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?\n\n21:11:03: ROMNEY: Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am.\n\nThe people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2013 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing.\n\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.\n\nAnd so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2013 the cornerstones of my plan.\n\nBut the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\n\nThe second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\n\nThe third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.\n\nMr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2013 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada.\n\nAnd, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\n\nAnd finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2013 the revenues going to the government. My \u2013 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.\n\nBut I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2013 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2013 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:14:22: OBAMA: Well, I think \u2013 let\u2019s talk about taxes, because I think it\u2019s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.\n\nAnd the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.\n\nNow, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim.\n\n21:16:34: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:36: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can \u2013 are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don\u2019t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\n\nOBAMA: And that\u2019s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\u2019s pledge of not reducing the deficit or \u2013 or \u2013 or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not my analysis. That\u2019s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And \u2013 and that kind of top \u2013 top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\u2019s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\n\n21:16:37: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let\u2019s just stay on taxes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Just \u2013 let\u2019s just stay on taxes for (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: What is the difference\u2026\n\n21:16:42: ROMNEY: Well, but \u2013 but virtually \u2013 virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\n\n21:16:43: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:44: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\u2019d say absolutely not. I\u2019m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I\u2019ve said is I won\u2019t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\u2019s part one. So there\u2019s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\n\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\u2019s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\u2019s just not the case. Look, I\u2019ve got five boys. I\u2019m used to people saying something that\u2019s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\u2019ll believe it. But that \u2013 that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\n\nAnd number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\u2019s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\u2019re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.\n\nThere are all these studies out there. But let\u2019s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates.\n\nAnd the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:18:30: LEHRER: That\u2019s where we started. Yeah.\n\nDo you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?\n\n21:18:34: OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he\u2019s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic.\n\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2013 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\n\nBut I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\nAnd the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\n\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2013 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened.\n\nBut under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2013 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income.\n\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\n\n21:21:01: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:21:03: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that \u2013 on that point, which is these\u2026\n\n21:21:04: LEHRER: Just for the \u2013 just for record\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:21:07: ROMNEY: \u2026 the small businesses we\u2019re talking about\u2026\n\n21:21:09: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we\u2019re way over our first 15 minutes.\n\n21:21:10: ROMNEY: It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\n\n21:21:11: LEHRER: It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s great. No problem. Well, you all don\u2019t have \u2013 you don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t have a problem, because we\u2019re still on the economy. We\u2019re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.\n\nOK, but go ahead, sir.\n\n21:21:38: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you\u2019re \u2013 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not \u2013 not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2013 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.\n\nNow, and \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2013 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\n\n21:22:58: OBAMA: Jim, I \u2013 you may want to move onto another topic, but I \u2013 I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion \u2013 just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that\u2019s more than our entire defense budget \u2013 and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\u2019s plan may work for you.\n\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\u2019ve tried this. We\u2019ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I\u2019m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\u2019ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\u2019ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\u2019re not blowing up the deficit.\n\n21:24:40: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:42: LEHRER: Well, you\u2019re going to get the first word in the next segment.\n\n21:24:48: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:50: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me \u2013 let me repeat \u2013 let me repeat what I said. I\u2019m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That\u2019s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That\u2019s point one.\n\nSo you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that\u2019s not my plan.\n\nNumber two, let\u2019s look at history. My plan is not like anything that\u2019s been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.\n\nMy priority is putting people back to work in America. They\u2019re suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It\u2019s absolutely extraordinary. We\u2019ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.\n\nGoing forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\n\n21:26:01: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s talk \u2013 we\u2019re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.\n\nAnd the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you \u2013 you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\n\n21:26:31: ROMNEY: Good. I\u2019m glad you raised that, and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a critical issue. I think it\u2019s not just an economic issue, I think it\u2019s a moral issue. I think it\u2019s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\u2019re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.\n\nAnd the amount of debt we\u2019re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\n\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\u2019re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.\n\nThe presidents would \u2013 president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\n\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don\u2019t pass it: Is the program so critical it\u2019s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I\u2019ll get rid of it. Obamacare\u2019s on my list.\n\nI apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.\n\nOBAMA: I like it.\n\nROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I\u2019ll get rid of that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Jim, I\u2019m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I\u2019m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, I\u2019ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\n\nNumber three, I\u2019ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\n\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.\n\nThe president said he\u2019d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president\u2019s put it in place as much public debt \u2013 almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.\n\n21:28:35: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\n\n21:28:37: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.\n\nAnd despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.\n\nSo 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2013 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.\n\nAnd I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nNow, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.\n\nAnd the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2013 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.\n\nLet \u2013 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.\n\nNow, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:15: OBAMA: \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.\n\n21:31:22: LEHRER: Mr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n21:31:26: OBAMA: And \u2013 and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\n\n21:31:28: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\n\n21:31:28: OBAMA: Sorry.\n\n21:31:34: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:34: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.\n\n21:31:35: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:36: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It\u2019s not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\n\n21:31:48: OBAMA: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\u2019re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But you\u2019ve been \u2013 but you\u2019ve been president four years\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:54: ROMNEY: You\u2019ve been president four years. You said you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. It\u2019s now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we\u2019ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\u2019re re-elected, we\u2019ll get to a trillion-dollar debt.\n\nI mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2013 I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done.\n\nLet me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d\n\nWell, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2013 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing. It\u2019s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.\n\nYou raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\u2019s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to kill jobs in this environment.\n\nI\u2019ll make one more point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:21: LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.\n\n21:33:22: ROMNEY: OK.\n\n21:33:23: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:33:24: OBAMA: Well, we\u2019ve had this discussion before.\n\n21:33:26: LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\n\n21:33:30: OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He\u2019s ruled out revenue.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:31: ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:30: ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That\u2019s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you\u2019ll never get there. You\u2019ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.\n\nSpain \u2013 Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We\u2019re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don\u2019t want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\u2019re working.\n\n21:34:11: LEHRER: But \u2013 but Mr. President, you\u2019re saying in order to \u2013 to get the job done, it\u2019s got to be balanced. You\u2019ve got to have\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:34:16: OBAMA: If \u2013 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.\n\nThe oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get.\n\nNow, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2013 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2013 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.\n\nWell, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\n\nRight now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue.\n\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.\n\nIt means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2013 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old.\n\nThat is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices.\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.\n\nAnd the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\n\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2013 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.\n\nNow, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\nAnd governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\n\n21:37:19: ROMNEY: Jim, let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it\u2019s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools\u2026\n\n21:37:22: LEHRER: Come back to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:37:25: ROMNEY: \u2026 to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let\u2019s go through them one by one.\n\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it\u2019s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that\u2019s been in place for a hundred years. Now\u2026\n\nOBAMA: It\u2019s time to end it.\n\nROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.\n\nNow, I like green energy as well, but that\u2019s about 50 years\u2019 worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\n\nBut, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years\u2019 worth of breaks, into \u2013 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don\u2019t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this \u2013 this is not \u2013 this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\n\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I\u2019ve been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.\n\nLEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But \u2013 but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I\u2019d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\n\nAnd, finally, Medicaid to states? I\u2019m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\u2019re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you\u2019re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\n\nAnd I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors \u2013 Republican and Democrats \u2013 said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\n\nSo \u2013 so let\u2019s state \u2013 one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don\u2019t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.\n\nAnd, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.\n\n21:39:49: LEHRER: Let\u2019s go.\n\n21:39:48: ROMNEY: But \u2013 but the right \u2013 the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\n\n21:39:52: LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\u2019re going on \u2013 still on the economy, on another \u2013 but another part of it\u2026\n\nOBAMA: OK.\n\n21:39:56: LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First \u2013 first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\n\n21:40:15: OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2013 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2013 the basic structure is sound.\n\nBut \u2013 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now.\n\nYou know, my grandmother \u2013 some of you know \u2013 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice.\n\nAnd the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\n\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going.\n\n$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a \u2013 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2013 throughout the system.\n\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\n\n21:42:38: LEHRER: We\u2019ll follow up on this.\n\nFirst, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\n\n21:42:41: ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s going to change their life for the worse.\n\nAnd the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further.\n\nBut for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not.\n\nBut on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.\n\nWe also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients.\n\nThis \u2013 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.\n\nNow, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2013 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade.\n\nI want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.\n\nBut the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\n\nAnd with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\n\n21:44:43: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:44:44: OBAMA: First of all, I think it\u2019s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.\n\nAnd the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It\u2019s called premium support, but it\u2019s understood to be a voucher program. His running mate\u2026\n\n21:45:05: LEHRER: And you don\u2019t support that?\n\n21:45:07: OBAMA: I don\u2019t. And let me explain why.\n\n21:45:08: ROMNEY: Again, that\u2019s for future\u2026\n\n21:45:09: OBAMA: I understand.\n\n21:45:10: ROMNEY: \u2026 people, right, not for current retirees.\n\n21:45:12: OBAMA: For \u2013 so if you\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re 54 or 55, you might want to listen \u2018cause this \u2013 this will affect you.\n\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.\n\nThe problem is that because the voucher wouldn\u2019t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\n\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\u2019ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\u2019s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\u2019ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.\n\nAnd then what you\u2019ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own \u2013 only my opinion. AARP thinks that the \u2013 the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \u201cObamacare,\u201d if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They\u2019re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.\n\nAnd the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\u2019t making seniors any healthier. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\n\n21:47:21: LEHRER: We\u2019ll talk about \u2013 specifically about health care in a moment. But what \u2013 do you support the voucher system, Governor?\n\n21:47:27: ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.\n\n21:47:32: LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:47:36: ROMNEY: So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice.\n\nThey get to choose \u2013 and they\u2019ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don\u2019t have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That\u2019s not going to happen. They\u2019ll have at least two plans.\n\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\u2019ll be able to get a private plan.\n\nI know my own view is I\u2019d rather have a private plan. I\u2019d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\u2019d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\u2019t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.\n\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\u2019re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\u2019s the plan that I\u2019ve put forward.\n\nAnd, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or \u2013 or Senator Wyden, who\u2019s the co-author of the bill with \u2013 with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. This is an idea that\u2019s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\n\n21:49:05: OBAMA: Jim, if I \u2013 if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.\n\nAnd private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what they do. And so you\u2019ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck.\n\nAnd this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\n\nOne last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid\u2026 LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.\n\nOBAMA: \u2026 but \u2013 but \u2013 but overall.\n\nLEHRER: OK.\n\nOBAMA: And so\u2026\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big topic. Can we \u2013 can we stay on Medicare?\n\nOBAMA: Is that a \u2013 is that a separate topic?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Yeah, we\u2019re going to \u2013 yeah, I want to get to it.\n\nOBAMA: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nLEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 before we leave the economy\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:50:20: ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\n\n21:50:25: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:50:27: ROMNEY: If that\u2019s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\n\n21:50:30: LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.\n\n21:50:32: ROMNEY: But my experience \u2013 my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\n\n21:50:38: LEHRER: All right. Can we \u2013 can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice \u2013 a clear choice between the two\u2026\n\n21:50:40: ROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 of you on Medicare?\n\nROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n21:50:42: LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there \u2013 should there be more?\n\nBeginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we\u2019ll go for a few minutes, and then we\u2019re going to go to health care, OK?\n\n21:51:07: ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can\u2019t have a free market work if you don\u2019t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have \u2013 I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn\u2019t have people opening up banks in their \u2013 in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\n\n21:51:30: LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\n\n21:51:31: ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.\n\n21:51:32: LEHRER: Like where?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:51:37: ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what\u2019s happened with some of the legislation that\u2019s been passed during the president\u2019s term, you\u2019ve seen regulation become excessive, and it\u2019s hurt \u2013 it\u2019s hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.\n\nDodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they\u2019re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that\u2019s been given to \u2013 to New York banks I\u2019ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There\u2019ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.\n\nSo there\u2019s one example. Here\u2019s another. In Dodd-Frank\u2026\n\n21:52:15: LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\n\n21:52:17: ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We\u2019re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for\u2026\n\n21:52:25: LEHRER: Well, here\u2019s a specific\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:28: ROMNEY: But let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s mention \u2013 let me mention the other one. Let\u2019s talk\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:33: LEHRER: No, let\u2019s not. Let\u2019s let him respond \u2013 let\u2019s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.\n\n21:52:41: OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.\n\nNow, it wasn\u2019t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were \u2013 that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\u2019t have been given, because the folks didn\u2019t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\u2019t.\n\nBut you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\n\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2013 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\u2019ve going to make sure that you\u2019ve got to have a living will so \u2013 so we can know how you\u2019re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\u2019t have other taxpayer bailouts.\n\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.\n\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nAnd, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.\n\nAnd so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\u2019s not what I believe.\n\n21:54:42: ROMNEY: Sorry, but that\u2019s just not \u2013 that\u2019s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That\u2019s why I\u2019d have regulation. But I wouldn\u2019t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\u2019s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\u2019t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\u2019s killing regional and small banks. They\u2019re getting hurt.\n\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\u2019t qualified. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\u2019s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\u2019t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years. We don\u2019t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\u2019s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\u2019s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\u2019t come out with a clear regulation.\n\nI will make sure we don\u2019t hurt the functioning of our \u2013 of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\n\n21:55:55: LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let\u2019s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it\u2019s a two-minute new \u2013 new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.\n\nYou want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\n\n21:56:20: ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\u2019t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAnd the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2013 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, when \u2013 when \u2013 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it.\n\nSecond reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\n\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea.\n\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2013 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\n\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.\n\n21:58:19: LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal?\n\n21:58:20: OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn\u2019t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\u2019t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn\u2019t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.\n\nIf they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they\u2019re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they\u2019ve hit the limit.\n\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.\n\nAnd let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you\u2019ve got health insurance, it doesn\u2019t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around. They can\u2019t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance \u2013 your insurance plan until you\u2019re 26 years old. And it also says that you\u2019re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\n\nNumber two, if you don\u2019t have health insurance, we\u2019re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you\u2019re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\n\nNow, the last point I\u2019d make before\u2026\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes \u2013 two minutes is up, sir.\n\nOBAMA: No, I think \u2013 I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 the irony is that we\u2019ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn\u2019t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\n\n22:01:01: LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.\n\nAll right, Governor. Governor, tell \u2013 tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?\n\n22:01:10: ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:01:13: ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2013 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.\n\nSo entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.\n\nWhat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $716 billion.\n\nWe didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2013 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\n\nRight now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\n\nSo for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2013 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2013 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.\n\nI think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\n\n22:03:12: OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\n\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan.\n\nIt \u2013 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?\n\nBecause there \u2013 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line.\n\nOr, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it.\n\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2013 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2013 they\u2019ve engaged in.\n\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2013 it\u2019s true \u2013 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate.\n\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2013 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026\n\n22:06:24: LEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\n22:06:25: OBAMA: \u2026 at a time when it\u2019s vitally important.\n\n22:06:26: LEHRER: Let\u2019s let the governor explain what you would do\u2026\n\n22:06:27: ROMNEY: Well\u2026\n\n22:06:28: LEHRER: \u2026 if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:06:33: ROMNEY: Well, actually it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.\n\nBut let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nIn my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2013 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.\n\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.\n\nThis is the private market. These are small \u2013 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2013 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.\n\nIn order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.\n\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.\n\nThat\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\n\n22:08:36: OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\u2019re talking about can\u2019t make decisions about what treatments are given. That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nWell, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2013 if it\u2019s been under 90 days.\n\nBut that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d\n\nNow, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2013 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.\n\nIt just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry.\n\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2013 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?\n\nNo. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\n\n22:11:05: LEHRER: We\u2019re going to move to\u2026\n\n22:11:06: ROMNEY: No. I \u2013 I have to respond to that.\n\n22:11:08: LEHRER: No, but\u2026\n\n22:11:10: ROMNEY: Which is \u2013 which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and \u2013 and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway,\u201d I don\u2019t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\u2019ve said the same thing, you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\n\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2013 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2013 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time.\n\nThe federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\n\n22:12:45: LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And \u2013 and let\u2019s see. Role of government. And it is \u2013 you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you \u2013 but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President \u2013 do you believe there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\n\n22:13:14: OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.\n\n22:13:15: LEHRER: And do you \u2013 yeah.\n\n22:13:16: OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office.\n\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.\n\nLook, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.\n\nBut as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it.\n\nAnd so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.\n\nAnd when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.\n\nIt can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce.\n\n22:15:40: LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\n\n22:15:43: ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.\n\nSo I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\n\nThe role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.\n\nFirst, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military.\n\nSecond, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2013 by one another.\n\nWe\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2013 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\n\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2013 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working.\n\nAnd the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work.\n\n22:17:48: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:17:49: ROMNEY: We know that the path we\u2019re taking is not working. It\u2019s time for a new path.\n\n22:17:50: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s go through some specifics in terms of what \u2013 how each of you views the role of government. How do \u2013 education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\n\n22:18:03: ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is \u2013 is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I \u2013 and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he\u2019s \u2013 some ideas he\u2019s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and \u2013 and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and \u2013 and state schools to do a better job.\n\nMy own view, by the way, is I\u2019ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I \u2013 these are disabled kids or \u2013 or \u2013 or poor kids or \u2013 or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.\n\nSo all federal funds, instead of going to the \u2013 to the state or to the school district, I\u2019d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their \u2013 their \u2013 their student.\n\n22:18:50: LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\u2019s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\n\n22:18:57: OBAMA: Well, as I\u2019ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we\u2019ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they\u2019re having an impact right now.\n\n22:19:20: LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and \u2013 and those of Governor Romney on \u2013 about education and the federal government?\n\n22:19:25: OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we\u2019re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\n\nYou know, his \u2013 his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\u2019s talked about. And it wasn\u2019t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But \u2013 but what it did do is to \u2013 if you extrapolated how much money we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\u2019re setting up their training programs\u2026\n\n22:20:20: LEHRER: Do you \u2013 do you agree, Governor?\n\n22:20:21: OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:20:23: OBAMA: The \u2013 where they\u2019re partnering so that they\u2019re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\n\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.\n\nAnd we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.\n\nGovernor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option.\n\nAnd for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term.\n\n22:21:59: LEHRER: We\u2019re running out of time, gentlemen.\n\n(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?\n\n22:22:05: ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you\u2019re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I\u2019m not going to cut education funding. I don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and \u2013 and grants that go to people going to college. I\u2019m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\u2019m not planning on making changes there.\n\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into \u2013 into green jobs. And I \u2013 look, I\u2019m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have \u2013 that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion.\n\nAnd these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\n\nLook, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.\n\nThe right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2013 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education. It\u2019s because I care about education for all of our kids.\n\n22:23:49: LEHRER: All right, gentlemen\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:23:51: LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 barely have three minutes left. I\u2019m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\u2019ve done a poor job.\n\nOBAMA: You\u2019ve done a great job.\n\nLEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government \u2013 the role of government and governing, we\u2019ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three \u2013 three minutes left in the \u2013 in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we\u2019ve got three minutes total time here \u2013 and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?\n\nGovernor?\n\n22:24:41: ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time \u2013 of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.\n\n22:24:50: LEHRER: But what would you do as president?\n\n22:24:50: ROMNEY: We \u2013 as president, I will sit on day one \u2013 actually, the day after I get elected \u2013 I\u2019ll sit down with leaders \u2013 the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue \u2013 as we did in my state \u2013 we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the \u2013 in the \u2013 in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we\u2019re going to compromise our principle, but because there\u2019s common ground.\n\nAnd the challenges America faces right now \u2013 look, the reason I\u2019m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face \u2013 this deficit could crush the future generations. What\u2019s happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.\n\n22:25:53: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:25:53: ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership \u2013 leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if \u2013 if it\u2019s a Republican or a Democrat. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ll do it again.\n\n22:25:56: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n22:25:57: OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\u2019s going to have a busy first day, because he\u2019s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\u2019re sitting down with them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\u2019re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask\/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That\u2019s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.\n\nSo we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down,\u201d but you have to have a plan.\n\nNumber two, what\u2019s important is occasionally you\u2019ve got to say no, to \u2013 to \u2013 to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when \u2013 when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.\n\nWhen \u2013 when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\n\nLEHRER: All right\n\nOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\n\n22:27:53: LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\n\n22:28:05: OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\n\nYou know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession.\n\nThe auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.\n\nAll those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is \u2013 is channeled and \u2013 and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair shot. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair share \u2013 everybody\u2019s doing a fair share, and everybody\u2019s playing by the same rules.\n\nYou know, four years ago, I said that I\u2019m not a perfect man and I wouldn\u2019t be a perfect president. And that\u2019s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\u2019ve kept. But I also promised that I\u2019d fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I\u2019ve kept that promise and if you\u2019ll vote for me, then I promise I\u2019ll fight just as hard in a second term.\n\n22:30:17: LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\n\n22:30:18: ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\n\nThis is a \u2013 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.\n\nI \u2013 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\n\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths.\n\nBut they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.\n\nThere\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.\n\nI\u2019ll get incomes up again.\n\nYou\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.\n\nIf I\u2019m president I will create \u2013 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\n\nIf the president\u2019s re-elected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.\n\nIf I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\n\nIf the president were to be re-elected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients.\n\nI\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.\n\nAnd finally, military. The president\u2019s re-elected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.\n\nI will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\u2019s middle class working again.\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nLEHRER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I\u2019m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)",

    "text":"WASHINGTON, May 1, 2011 \u2014 -- AMANPOUR (voice-over): This week, budget blowback.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We can't afford it, you moron!\n\nAMANPOUR: As town halls across America erupt in anger over aplan to slash spending...\n\n(UNKNOWN): You're a liar!\n\nAMANPOUR: ... Republicans find themselves under fire.\n\n(UNKNOWN): ... he was yelling at me, cursing at me.\n\nAMANPOUR: I go to the heartland with the man behind the plan,House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\nRYAN: Let's prove to them that Wisconsinites can have a civildebate.\n\nAMANPOUR: Then, in the crosshairs. A NATO bomb hits a housewith Gadhafi inside, killing his son and three grandchildren. Howwill the strongman strike back? And how does it all end?\n\n(UNKNOWN): This was a direct operation to assassinate the leaderof this country.\n\nAMANPOUR: What's the way out for the U.S.? A formeradministration insider weighs in.\n\nPlus, we're live from the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II gets onestep closer to sainthood. Is the fast track too fast?\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, \"This Week\" withChristiane Amanpour starts right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome to our viewers here and around the world.There is a lot happening this Sunday, and we begin with unfolding newsin the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The Libyan government is condemningwhat it called, quote, \"a direct operation to assassinate MoammarGadhafi,\" this after a NATO bomb hit Gadhafi's compound. It sparedhim, but killed three of his grandchildren and his youngest son. Socould this be a game-changer in the war, which has dragged into astalemate in recent weeks?\n\nWe go live now to Libya for the very latest on the ground. ABC'sMiguel Marquez is in Benghazi, and the BBC's Christian Fraser is inTripoli, where the attack took place.\n\nChristian, let's start with you. Is there a feeling now that thewar is entering a new phase around Tripoli?\n\nFRASER: I think that's a very real possibility, Christiane. Theway that the press visit to this bomb site was orchestrated lastnight, it was very deliberately held back for two hours, and then wewere taken there and then given a press conference here at the hotel,in which Moussa Ibrahim spelled out what he thought the attack meantdoes suggest that they will try and make as much political capitalfrom this as they can.\n\nCertainly, it puts pressure on NATO and its allies. And we'veseen already a very angry reaction from his supporters in Tripoli,reports of attacks on the U.S. embassy. I've spoken to U.N. officialstoday who say their offices were looted, also reports of attacks onthe British and Italian missions here in Tripoli.\n\nThe unknowns, of course, are what Colonel Gadhafi's response willbe. We've not heard from him yet. We don't know what the response ofhis supporters will be in the days ahead, and we don't know, really,what the sort of international reaction will be to what has unfoldedhere last night.\n\nAMANPOUR: A lot of questions there, Christian, and we'llcontinue to monitor it.\n\nOf course, the U.S. embassy is empty, because all of the staffhave been evacuated over the last several weeks and months. And nowwe go to the other side of this conflict and ABC's Miguel Marquez,who's in the east there in rebel-held Benghazi.\n\nMiguel, what is the reaction from the rebels? Do they think thisattack could end the stalemate and signify a new -- a new impetus forthem?\n\nMARQUEZ: Well, the rebels certainly aren't buying this attack.They think that no one was killed in Tripoli last night. They'reliterally saying, \"Show us the bodies.\" They believe that this is atrick, another trick by Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, and they say that heis making this up simply to win that international support to dividethe coalition. They simply want to see those bodies. Whether or notit will make a difference to this I think will depend on what ColonelGadhafi and his troops do in the hours and days ahead -- Christiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: But, Miguel, is there any sense beyond this attackthat the rebels are getting any more organized or getting any moreweapons that they can actually take advantage of the help that NATO isgiving them?\n\nMARQUEZ: There's a lot of winks and nods there. There areindications that the Qataris are arming up. Certainly, there's beensome reporting on that front, but the rebels here are being very shyabout it. There are reports that the Qataris are (OFF-MIKE) but wehaven't seen any evidence of that.\n\nThe other thing that the rebels say about this, that this (OFF-MIKE) you know, the Predator drones were a huge boost to them, andthey believe that the U.S., they hope, will take even a greater rolein leading operations here in Libya -- Christiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Miguel, thank you so much.\n\nAnd later in the show, we'll get an expert's take on whether thisattack on Gadhafi will be a turning point in what's become a stalematefor the United States and its allies. But first, we turn to a different sort of battle being wagedright here in the United States. It's a budget battle, of course, andthis was the week Republican Congress members went home to defendtheir sweeping budget plan before their constituents. And thereception at one town hall after another was rocky.\n\nThe plan is the brain child of House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan,who's feeling some of the heat himself. I traveled to Wisconsin tosee how Ryan is weathering the storm.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: How are the crowds increasing and their levels ofanxiety and frustration?\n\nRYAN: It's increasing, no two ways about it.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Congressman Ryan is at the center of thestorm. It's his plan, of course, that has sparked the outcries.Across the country, the anger is palpable.\n\n(UNKNOWN): May I finish?\n\n(UNKNOWN): No.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(UNKNOWN): You went and gave away all those tax cuts.\n\nAMANPOUR: We've seen Republican congressmen fending off boos andcatcalls from constituents over a plan to fundamentally overhaul twoprograms that millions of Americans have come to count on, Medicareand Medicaid.\n\nRYAN: Hey, guys. How are you doing?\n\nAMANPOUR: With Congress in recess, Ryan is holding as many asfour town meetings a day, and it's still not enough to keep up withdemand from his constituents.\n\n(UNKNOWN): What I can do is I can give you a list of the otherlistening sessions we have scheduled today.\n\nRYAN: The crowds are really getting bigger, and people aregetting much more anxious about just where the country's headed.\n\nAMANPOUR: This is the tail end of the marathon series of townhalls for Ryan, who seems wholly unconcerned with the heat he's takingthese days. Though the crowds we saw in Wisconsin were mostlyfriendly, some of his town meetings have been contentious.\n\n(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) trickle down.\n\nRYAN: We do (OFF-MIKE)\n\n(CROSSTALK) RYAN: It's a sign of the times, I think. I think it's a sign ofanxiety of the times. It's also a sign of the misinformation that'sbeen perpetrated out there.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): Well, why do you say \"misinformation\"?\n\nRYAN: Well, there are TV, radio and phone calls that arerunning, trying to scare seniors. You know, the Democratic NationalCommittee is running phone calls to seniors in my district, TV ads,saying we're hurting current seniors when, in fact, that's not thecase. And so there's a lot of...\n\nAMANPOUR: Isn't that, though, par for the course?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, didn't you lot do it the last time?\n\nRYAN: Yes, Republicans -- Republicans -- both parties do this toeach other. And my whole point about that is, that's why we have thispolitical paralysis.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): On the day we joined him, the gym atFranklin High School fills up well before the congressman arrives.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAMANPOUR: Ryan's presentation is earnest and, it must be said,wonky.\n\nRYAN: This pie chart shows you our federal government, basicallyits budget for last year.\n\nAMANPOUR: The most controversial aspect of Paul Ryan's budgetplan would transform Medicare. He knows that could be politicalpoison with seniors, and so he makes sure to remind those in the crowdthe changes wouldn't impact them.\n\nRYAN: How many of you are 55 years of age or older? This budgetdoes not affect your Medicare benefits.\n\nAMANPOUR: But for many, that leaves more questions than answers,especially since budget watchdogs estimate the Medicare revamp wouldcost people who are now under 55 thousands of dollars out of pocketeach year once their benefits kick in, and that has some here inFranklin very concerned.\n\n(UNKNOWN): ... because it's going to be a real burden for them,especially with the economy coming up. And I think about all of the54-year-olds who have been unemployed. Where are they going to comeup with this money in 10 years to last their whole lifetime?\n\nAMANPOUR: Ryan argues delay is not an option.\n\nRYAN: Put these reforms in now, they don't take effect for 10years to give people time to prepare. If we keep kicking the can downthe road and if we keep going trillions of dollars deeper in the hole,then the reforms are going to be sudden, urgent, and severe, andimmediate, and people won't have -- that are going to catch them bysurprise.\n\nAMANPOUR: Then the session ends...\n\nRYAN: I appreciate you coming out.\n\nAMANPOUR: ... and Congressman Ryan is off. I stayed back tospeak with two of the women in the audience, Jackie (ph) and Lois(ph), each with very different perspectives on the congressman's plan.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I don't appreciate it at all, and that burns mypotatoes. And I think it's not fair. And I think it's selfish andself-centered. You're worried about the seniors of today, and we havethe seniors of tomorrow. We need to be worried about them, too. Andthere's a better way of fixing this plan, this problem that we didn'tget into, but we always got to be the ones.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): Did you vote for Paul Ryan?\n\n(UNKNOWN): No. No.\n\nAMANPOUR: Did you?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Lois says Ryan is trying to fix theproblem before time and money run out.\n\n(on-screen): The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has saidthat the average senior will end up paying some $6,500 more for theirhealth care.\n\n(UNKNOWN): In 10 years.\n\nAMANPOUR: Yes.\n\n(UNKNOWN): By 2020, the whole plan Obama has is going to crash.\n\nRYAN: A few sentences later, CBO also said that the status quoof Medicare is unsustainable.\n\nAMANPOUR: Maybe, but it's going to shift a huge burden on to theelderly.\n\nRYAN: Right. But what the CBO also forgot to add is that we'regiving an additional $7,800 for low-income seniors on top of that.And I would argue -- and CBO concurs with this -- comparing anyMedicare reform plan with the Medicare status quo is a fiscal fantasy.The Medicare status quo is not going be able to occur, because it'sunsustainable.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): And Ryan dismisses any talk that tacklingthis thorny issue will cost Republicans at the polls.\n\n(on-screen): And now people are getting worried, people in yourparty. Perhaps they might think it might even cost them the election.\n\nRYAN: Sure. And I hear this all the time from the politicalpeople, from the pundits and the pollsters that this could be -- thiscould hurt us politically. I don't care about that. What I careabout is fixing this country and getting this debt situation undercontrol.\n\nLook, literally, Christiane, if all we fear about is ourpolitical careers, then we have no business having these jobs. If youwant to good at these jobs, you've got to be willing to lose the job.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Still, politically it's a delicate dance.Just listen to Speaker John Boehner discuss Ryan's plan in aninterview with ABC's Jon Karl.\n\nBOEHNER: It's Paul's idea. Other people have other ideas. I'mnot wedded to one single idea.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): How do you feel when Speaker Boehner tellsABC News that he's not wedded to your program, it's a good idea, it'sone of many?\n\nRYAN: I've talked to John about this. It's an institutionalstatement reflecting budget resolutions. And what a budget resolution-- which is what we've passed -- it's the architecture of a budget.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you didn't take it personally about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: No, not at all. I didn't take it personally. It's not --it wasn't meant to be personal. I don't take it that way.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you sure about that?\n\nRYAN: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I've talked to him quite a bit aboutthis.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): And with that, we arrive at our nextstop.\n\nRYAN: Hey, folks. Nice to see you. Thank you very much.\n\nAMANPOUR: Some boos, but mostly cheers. The crowd is largelysupportive.\n\n(UNKNOWN): And I'd like to thank you for being a bold person andstanding up and saying, \"Listen, we can't continue this way.\"\n\nAMANPOUR: Still, this man is angry that Ryan's plan refuses toconsider raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Borrow the money from the rich, fix the problem.\n\nRYAN: Look, I think a lot of people think this is sort of likethe magic fairy dust of budgets, that we can just make a small amountof people pay some more taxes and it will fix all of our problems.Well, let's keep our eye on the ball. The eye on the ball isspending. And the sooner we get this thing under control, the betteroff everybody is going to be.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): How do you feel about being the bogeymanin this whole budget business?\n\nRYAN: You know, I don't really think about it. I sleep well atnight.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): At the end of the day, Congressman Ryanand I sit down to talk about the bottom line.\n\n(on-screen): People who've been studying your numbers verycarefully and -- have been saying that the numbers don't add up.\n\nRYAN: Well, the Congressional Budget Office Says they do.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, it also says that two-thirds of the savings thatyou want to make in the spending cuts come at the expense of programsdesigned for the poor, for the disadvantaged, and this is reverseRobin Hood-ism, if you like, take from the poor, give back to the richagain.\n\nRYAN: Yeah, sure, I've heard that. Yeah, I would disagree withthat. First of all, spending increases in this budget. Spending onthe safety net increases, but it increases at a more sustainable rate.Here's the problem, Christiane. The safety net we have right now isgoing bankrupt. It's tearing apart at the seams.\n\nAMANPOUR: What you're proposing seems like it's going to put alot of the burden on the seniors. They're worried that they're notgoing to be able to afford the cost of health insurance.\n\nRYAN: So we're saying give the most vulnerable people more moneyto cover their expenses and don't give wealthy people as much money tocover their expenses because they're wealthy and they should be ableto afford more. But we're also saying is, you've got to get at theroot cause of health inflation. Even President Obama is saying slowthe growth rate of Medicare.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): For now, the president and thecongressman seem far apart. And as we crisscross his Wisconsindistrict, I ask Paul Ryan if some grand budget bargain could be in theoffing.\n\n(on-screen): Do you think that these massive issues that you'redealing with, the budget, let's say, can be done only by one party?\n\nRYAN: No. No, I don't. I think it's going to have...\n\nAMANPOUR: So you have to negotiate?\n\nRYAN: Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.\n\nAMANPOUR: You have to work together? RYAN: Yes, I think so.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that atmosphere available...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: No, not right now.\n\nAMANPOUR: It's not, is it?\n\nRYAN: Look, we're probably not going to get some grand-slamagreement that fixes all of these problems. My now hope is to get asingle or a double, you know, to get something done that gets us onthe right path.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: Congressman Ryan says that he expects Republicans andDemocrats to agree on some fiscal controls to lock in spending levels,but he says a big-picture deal on the debt crisis probably won'thappen before the 2012 election. And it's what the treasurysecretary, Tim Geithner, said also on this program a couple of weeksago.\n\nSo the big question remains: Can the United States afford to waitthat long? Our powerhouse roundtable tackles that and weighs in withtheir reviews of the president's stand-up act, as well, at lastnight's White House correspondents' dinner.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Tonight, for the first time, I am releasing my officialbirth video.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet's take a look.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: He's taken some flack lately, but no one is happier, noone is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than theDonald. And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on theissues that matter, like did we fake the moon landing? What reallyhappened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: A little light moment last night from the White Housecorrespondents' dinner. President Obama taking a shot at DonaldTrump. Funny stuff, and we'll talk about it a little later.\n\nBut across the country, passions are running high on a moreserious matter, a Republican debt reform plan that would slashspending and revamp Medicare and Medicaid without raising taxes on thewealthy. Has Paul Ryan laid the roadmap to victory for the Democrats?Or will his party have the last laugh?\n\nJoining me to answer that question, George Will, AriannaHuffington of the Huffington Post, Chrystia Freeland, global editor atThomson Reuters, and David Stockman, who served as budget directorunder Ronald Reagan.\n\nThank you all for being here. Some of us were at that dinnerlast night, but, first, George, you heard what I asked CongressmanRyan, asking him about some of the Republicans who seem to be runningnow from the plan. Is this an election loser for them? Will theystick with him?\n\nWILL: They've clearly made a wager that this time the Americanpeople mean what they say about cutting government. His plan now forthe budget is not the same as, but it's in the same general directionas the roadmap he proposed for entitlement reform and all the rest afew years ago (inaudible) pointing out the grand total of 13cosponsors. People are not eager to embrace it. He now hasessentially made them embrace it by making the running.\n\nRepublicans are somewhat emboldened by the example of Marco Rubiorunning for the Senate in Florida in 2010, when, in a state plantedthick with seniors, the state known as God's antechamber, as a matterof fact, in the great state of Florida, he said we must raise theretirement age and perhaps, in some sense, means test Social Security.He said that volatile thing in that state and won in a landslide.\n\nHUFFINGTON: (OFF-MIKE) starting to listen to this incrediblyshrinking budget debate where we're basically discussing what we'recutting without discussing what's happening in the country with jobs,basically, despite the fact that supposedly, you know, we have areduction in unemployment. We know this is really a statisticalreason because of the shrinking of the actual labor force, but not anyreal creation of jobs. And that's really what is so outstanding, thatwe are not focusing on this.\n\nAnd you go around the country, and there's this anxiety, thisfear about kids graduating from college not being able to get jobs.The foreclosures are still rampant. Even Mitt Romney, you know, inNew Hampshire actually took this on and sounded like a real populist,talking about the problems of people not being able to make ends meet.\n\nAMANPOUR: But what about the figures, the basic arithmetic? Imean, it is complex. You go to these town hall meetings, and thepresentations are complex. And even people with vaguely conversantviews on all of this find it difficult to understand. Is there a wayto figure out what the actual math is without entering political andideological debates? Is there a way to balance this budget, to reducethe debt, to get a hold of it without sort of hewing to very differentpolitical views?\n\nFREELAND: Well, I think it's always going to be a politicaldebate, but what I think is really missing in both the Republican andthe Democratic approach right now and is really an example ofpolitical cowardice is taxes.\n\nYou know, and we heard in your interview, Christiane, Ryansaying, well, you know, this is about cutting spending. It's partlygoing to be about cutting spending, but it is also going to be aboutraising taxes. And that's the thing that I think no one has thecourage to talk about.\n\nAnd it's partly going to be -- I think there should be more taxeson the very rich. They're doing incredibly well in this economy. Butit is also going to be about more taxes on the middle class, includingconsumption taxes.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, that's interesting. I want to get toconsumption taxes. But, David, Paul Ryan says that people see taxhikes as sort of a fairy dust that will solve everything. Is eitherparty dealing with the tax issue in a way that could actually solvesomething?\n\nSTOCKMAN: No, I think both parties are delusional in thinkingthat this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balancedbudget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem.\n\nThis debt that we're issuing every day, $6 billion a day, is notbeing bought by real investors. It's being bought by the Fed andother central banks around the world, and they're going out ofbusiness in June. The Fed is stopping the bond-buying. QE2 is over.The Chinese no longer need to buy, and the Japanese have their ownproblem.\n\nSo once we have to sell the debt to real investors, interestrates are going to start rising and the crisis will come immediately,in the next two or three years.\n\nNow, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing.He cuts $600 billion or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a smallpart of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicaretotally untouched for 3 years, leaves Social Security totallyuntouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next3 years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all backby extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford.\n\nNow, that's getting nowhere. In three years, he does not cut onedime from the debt.\n\nFREELAND: Yeah, David, I have a question for you. You workedfor Ronald Reagan. Do you think that America, the American economy --so you're like a red-blooded capitalist -- could it sustain highertaxes than it has now?\n\nSTOCKMAN: Absolutely. In 1982, we were looking at the jaws ofthe worst recession since the 1930s. We overdid it in '81, cut taxestoo much. We came back with the big deficit plan. In 1982,unemployment's 10 percent, the economy's in dire shape, and we raisedtaxes by 1.2 percent of GDP, which would be $150 billion a year, rightnow, not 10 years down the road, but right now. That's what we did in1982, because we still had people in government who realized you can'tsimply be putting on this kind of debt into the world financialmarket.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, George, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid iscalling for a vote on this up or down. Is that -- what is that goingto do? And do you think there is room for some kind of debate on aconsumption tax, even though very few people want to do income?\n\nWILL: Oh, well, people of my persuasion will be all for it,considering a consumption tax, as soon as they repeal the 16thAmendment. Otherwise, they're going to pile a consumption tax, whichis invisible to most people, on top of the income tax.\n\nLarry Summers, the departing economic adviser, said conservativeshate the consumption tax because they think it's a money machine forgovernment and liberals don't like it because they think it'sregressive. We will get a consumption tax when conservatives realizeit's regressive and conservatives -- and liberals realize it's a moneymachine. It's not going to happen. The Senate has voted in anonbinding resolution something like 86-10 against the idea of aconsumption tax.\n\nHUFFINGTON: You know, what is interesting is what Ryan isleaving out. You know, he's talking about reforming Medicare. He'snot even allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceuticalcompanies to reduce drug costs. So he's not only addressing the majorproblem of drug costs rising, of health care costs rising.\n\nAnd also finally over the last week, he started talking aboutcorporate welfare, about oil and gas subsidies, for example, but thatisn't part of his budget. So how can he be addressing seriously thebudget deficit without addressing seriously corporate welfare?\n\nHe said, which also sounded interesting, that he doesn't want thegovernment picking winners and losers. That's part of (inaudible)left and right debate. A lot of people across the political spectrumare saying that. Let's focus on this.\n\nAMANPOUR: He said to us that he is willing to talk about sort ofgetting rid of all those subsidies for oil companies and all thoseloopholes. Where do you think this is headed, though, in realeconomic fiscal terms? I mean, is there going to be some kind of dealon the very difficult issues?\n\nFREELAND: I thought that what you and Ryan had to say was right.I think that it's hard to see a real deal before the presidentialelection, and I think that David is right to point out that that couldturn out to be quite tricky. And where we will really have theimportant market judgment is in June, when all this money that theFederal Reserve has been pumping into the economy and buying back,that's going to stop, and we're going to really see, how much is theworld prepared to support the U.S. economy?\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. We'll continue right after a break. Andup next, President Obama releases his birth certificate and DonaldTrump claims credit. More of that with our roundtable right afterthis.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: But I'm speaking to the vast majority of the Americanpeople, as well as the press. We do not have time for this kind ofsilliness. We've got better stuff to do.\n\nTRUMP: Today, I'm very proud of myself, because I'veaccomplished something that nobody else has been able to accomplish.Our president has finally released a birth certificate.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: President Obama and Donald Trump earlier this week.So have we seen the last of the birthers? Let's bring back ourroundtable.\n\nHave we seen the last of this, George?\n\nWILL: Sure, I mean, to the extent that people are open toevidence. Now, there are some people in a nation of 310 millionpeople -- there are some people who are just cracked, and we're alwaysgoing to have them out there.\n\nAMANPOUR: You know, you say cracked. On this program last week,we spoke with Reverend Franklin Graham, and he seemed to flirt withthe idea of giving some credence to this and also supporting DonaldTrump. And then when I asked him sort of, you know, why is it thatthis issue has been hijacked by the lunatic fringe and it's becomesuch an issue? This is what I asked him, and listen to what heresponded.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: You're a very important figure, and you have a bigfollowing, and you have a lot of authority. This business about thebirth certificate, it really has been debunked over and over again.So I just want to know why somebody like you can't just say, \"Enoughalready.\"\n\nGRAHAM: Oh, no, I'm not -- you were asking me about DonaldTrump...\n\nAMANPOUR: No, I'm now talking about President Obama.\n\nGRAHAM: Oh, right. But it's Trump that has brought this up.I'm not bringing up his birth certificate. I'm just saying, it lookslike, for the critics out there, his critics -- and I'm not one ofthem -- his critics, it looks like he could shut their mouths prettyquickly by coming up with a little bit more than what he's come upwith.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So he has come up, and you're shaking your head,Chrystia.\n\nFREELAND: I think it's obvious that it's just going to move onto new things. And we've already seen Donald Trump talking about,well, you know, maybe his college -- maybe his college documentsaren't exactly right.\n\nI mean, I think that there is something behind all of this thatenough people aren't talking about and that the president actuallyrather recently hinted at in his speech last night, with the \"LionKing\" stuff and then saying, you know, Michele Bachmann, maybe she wasborn in Canada. There is a racial element here. And I think thatpart of the whole birther movement is about finding a way that isn'tovertly racist to say, is he really American? You know, can thisblack guy really be an American?\n\nSTOCKMAN: I don't think it's so much racism. I think it'sWashington has succumb to theater and has lost the point that itshould be about governance. And one of the reasons for that is thatthe Fed has enabled Washington to run massive deficits year after yearafter year and issue all of these bonds and get away with it.\n\nAnd so, therefore, since they're not worried, since they don'tfear the consequence of what they're doing, they're willing to engagein this kind of, you know, rank theater, when, so to speak, Rome isburning.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTOCKMAN: And one of these days we're going to have a rudeawakening, and I believe it's coming soon.\n\nAMANPOUR: So...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHUFFINGTON: But this is also something that's always happened intimes of deep economic anxiety. Paranoid politics can thrive, anddemagoguery can thrive, and people can believe things for whichthere's no evidence.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, clearly, people have believed things for whichthere's no evidence, but, George, what does this mean now for theRepublican field? I mean, is Donald Trump a serious candidate or hashe been deflated, given the fact that Haley Barbour, governor ofMississippi, has stepped out? Where does the Republican field looklike it is right now?\n\nWILL: The Republican field is perfectly fine. They lost inHaley Barbour a plausible president, and they lost it because heunderstands the Broder rule. The late David Broder said anyone whowill do what you have to do to become president shouldn't be allowedto be president. And he said this requires a 10-year commitment; I'mnot prepared to make it. That's not a moral failing. In some people,it's a sign of maturity. You have Romney, Pawlenty, perhaps MitchDaniels -- I don't -- who am I leaving out?\n\nFREELAND: Huckabee.\n\nHUFFINGTON: Huntsman.\n\nWILL: Huntsman.\n\nFREELAND: Isn't this a good moment for Huckabee now?\n\nWILL: It might be, but the fact is, we're actually fairly faralong in this process. We've winnowed the field already. We knowbasically who the choice is going to be. The Republicans have tosimply nominate someone who is a plausible president and then itbecomes a referendum on Mr. Obama.\n\nHUFFINGTON: But, actually, George has a point here. And SethMeyers last night in a way made that point when he said the one personwho can really beat you, Mr. President, is Obama '08, and don't youmiss him, effectively? What happened to him?\n\nAnd I was talking to a hard-core Democrat after the dinner whosaid to me that Obama is gone. He said he's not coming back. We justhave to win. So this is what's happened, and it's a interestingdynamic. You know, hard-core Democrats are just about winning, butthe problem for the White House is all the first-time voters who cameout in large numbers and really got him to the White House in '08.Are they coming back? Because they're not just about winning. Theywere inspired. And that was the other thing that Seth Meyers saidyesterday. What is will.i.am going to do this year? Is he going tofind something to rhyme with debt ceiling? That's a big problemfor...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, talking to that, what is the correct or thewinnable economic strategy to be taking going into this election?Obviously -- and you've all been saying it -- it is about jobs. And Ithink you've been saying that all of this is obscuring the necessityto figure out jobs.\n\nFREELAND: Well, I think especially for a Democrat, which thepresident is, I've been surprised that they haven't pushed much moreon that. Maybe they're worried that they don't have a very strongjobs record, but I think that they really are letting the Republicansset the terms of the debate, and the debate right now is about cuttingspending, maybe raising taxes. I think that a smart Democraticstrategy would be to come out and say, \"I am the guy who is going tofocus on middle-class jobs. I care about that.\"\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTOCKMAN: No, I think the right strategy is to focus on theengine of destruction in our economy today, which is the Fed. The Fedis savaging Main Street, with zero earnings -- interest on theirsavings, with this massive inflation we have now in food and fuel. Atthe same time, it is fueling the greatest bubble that we've seen yet,even bigger than housing. It's all going to a few thousand people onWall Street.\n\nFREELAND: But, David, come on...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTOCKMAN: Now, that has to stop...\n\nAMANPOUR: On that note...\n\nSTOCKMAN: ... and he could stop that. And yet what did he do?He reappointed the same guy who brought you the problem that electedhim in 2008.\n\nAMANPOUR: You're going to discuss this further in the GreenRoom. And up next, we go live to Rome, where this morning theCatholic Church puts Pope John Paul II one step closer to sainthood.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome back. We told you at the top of this programthat a NATO air strike hit a building with Moammar Gadhafi inside inLibya. Reportedly it just missed him, but killed his youngest son andthree grandchildren.\n\nAnd it's been a costly week across the Middle East, including forthe United States servicemembers, nine of whom were murdered by anAfghan pilot right there near Kabul.\n\nJoining me to talk about it all is Vali Nasr, who until veryrecently was a senior adviser to the State Department on the MiddleEast and Afghanistan, and Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow WilsonInternational Center, who also used to be a Middle East peace adviserto various administrations.\n\nGentlemen, thank you both very much for joining me.\n\nMILLER: A pleasure.\n\nNASR: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: So this is a big day, and people are wondering whetherthis is going to be a turning point, this attack in Tripoli, veryclose to the Gadhafi stronghold, and apparently killing one of hissons. Vali, what does this mean as the U.S. policy seems to be in astalemate?\n\nNASR: Well, aside from the diplomatic issues that it raises,it's now very clear that the narrative is rapidly changing, that thisdemocracy wave is not self-sustaining anymore. It's increasinglycoming upon the United States or the pressure is on the United Statesto push it to the next stage. And that could be a tall order. Itcould be expensive. It could be messy. And we need to sort of stepback and think about how we tackle this new challenge.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, in Libya, you say the narrative is changing. Isit saying it's a war without end? Is it -- what is it saying there?\n\nNASR: Well, it has been a war without end, but now it's alsocoming down -- at least the narrative that's going to be seen iscoming down to literally having to remove Gadhafi out of the scene.And if NATO is going after him, it is essentially sending a signal outthat democracy is not going to succeed, that the rebels are not goingto succeed unless we go in and remove the leadership. And thatobviously is a whole new order of business with this issue.\n\nAMANPOUR: So potentially removing the leadership, if it comes tothat, what about in Syria, where you've worked very closely on thoseissues for Republican and Democratic administration? People arelooking at that. It's been a very bloody week in Syria, and yet nosort of idea that Bashar Assad, the president, should be removed.\n\nMILLER: It's because great powers are allowed and do behavehypocritically and inconsistently. And the reality is, Libya waseasy. It was vulnerable. No serious air defense system. No seriousallies. We could get away with and did military intervention.Syria's quite different.\n\nAnd, number two, you don't have a fundamentally divided country.You don't have Syrias right now. You have repression. And you haveBashar Assad mobilizing the instruments of power in order to stay inpower. I think the arc on the Assads over time is a negative one, andI think they're an old story, but it's going to take a long time forthis movie to play out.\n\nAMANPOUR: The movie is being very closely watched by many peoplein the United States and around the world. People are always comingup to me and asking me, what does this all mean for us, what happenedin Tunisia, what happened in Egypt?\n\nPeople thought Egypt was a democratic revolution, whichpresumably it still has an opportunity to be, but the latest Pew pollsgive some worrying figures for the United States, basically sayingabout Egypt that 52 percent of Egyptians now disapprove of howPresident Obama is dealing with the calls for political change intheir own nation, Egypt, elsewhere, Tunisia, Bahrain, and Libya. Andthen their view of the United States, 79 percent unfavorable, 20percent favorable. Vali, how can this be? People hoped that ademocratic Middle East would actually have a better view of the UnitedStates.\n\nNASR: Well, first of all, we're not at a democracy in the MiddleEast. All that we've achieved is that in Tunisia and Egypt, whichwere the easy cases, the leadership has gone. There's still a longdistance between the old order going and actually arriving atdemocracy. And there is also a very short distance in these kinds ofsituations between euphoria and disenchantment.\n\nAnd finally, the fundamental issues that divided the people ofthe Middle East from the United States have not gone away. The MiddleEast has been busy with other issues recently, but when the dustsettles, the critical issues of the Arab-Israeli peace process, thiswhole issue between Islam and the West, Iran, you know, all of theseissues, Al Qaida, are still there. And nothing has happened to closethe gap between our perception of those issues and the people'sperception of those issues in the Muslim world.\n\nAMANPOUR: I'm going to get to the Middle East peace process intwo seconds, but I just want to ask you further, the foreign policy ofEgypt looks like they are going closer to their traditionaladversaries -- let's say Iran, let's say Hamas -- people who are sortof -- definitely adversaries of the United States, as well. How isthis going to work out? And why is that?\n\nNASR: Well, because for the longest time our foreign policy inthe Middle East was based on the support of the palaces, who reallydidn't need to deal with the street and the people in the Middle East.It's the Mubaraks and Ben Alis and, you know, kings of Saudi Arabiaand Jordan that made decisions that we work with. Now we have to dealwith countries that are reflecting the public opinion of their masses.\n\nAMANPOUR: Of the street. It's the famous Arab street.\n\nNASR: Arab street. And until such day where there is somecommon ground between our street and their street, we're going to havethis disjunction. It's possible, for instance, on the issue of AlQaida that we can -- there can be some sense of common interestbetween Americans and the people of the Middle East. But on issues ofArab-Israeli issue, on Iran, and on a number of other issues, the gapis still too wide, and we're going to see that opinion of the regionis going to get reflected in the foreign policy.\n\nAMANPOUR: And now, on the Middle East, people also are nowasking about the development this week, the rapprochement between thePalestinian Authority, supported by the United States, and Hamas,which the U.S. and Israel say is a terrorist organization. What doesthat mean for the peace process? And is there one?\n\nMILLER: It's not even noon and I'm already depressed talkingabout focusing on this issue. I mean, Vali's point is a good one.And before the Middle East issue, our street cred is way down. We'reneither admired, feared or respected as much as we need to be, giventhe fundamental nature and vital interests that we have in thisregion.\n\nWe're involved in three wars where the standard for victory isnot can we win, but when can we leave? We are responding in a verydifficult -- and it's understandable way to both the Arab spring inEgypt and Tunisia and the Arab winter in Bahrain, in Yemen, and inSyria. So our prestige and power...\n\nAMANPOUR: It's events-driven.\n\nMILLER: For sure. Our prestige and power is way down. And whathistory teaches us is when, in fact, the United States presides overbreakthroughs on this other issue, the problem of the much toopromised land, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, our street cred wasactually up. We demonstrated both in warmaking and peacemaking --Kissinger, Carter and Baker, the three -- that we could actuallysucceed. Right now, we're stuck. We're stuck in a region we can'tfix and we're stuck in a region from which we cannot extricateourselves. Bad news for the great power.\n\nAMANPOUR: It sounds pretty bad news the way you're saying it.And I wanted to ask you -- there was an article in the New Yorker thisweek which quoted an administration official as saying that the policyright now was lead from behind. What does that mean, lead frombehind?\n\nNASR: Well, I don't know the exact context in which that...\n\nAMANPOUR: Talking about Libya and elsewhere.\n\nNASR: Elsewhere. But the real issue for us is this, is that wehave a disjuncture between our means and our goals in the region.We're not dealing with events in only one country. We're dealing withevents over a vast region that may be unfolding over a number ofyears, and we have to find a way to have a sustainable policy.\n\nAnd therefore, if we push too hard, if we remove governments,then much has happened in Iraq or Afghanistan. We're going to own itafterwards. We have to do the state building, which has not been easyor cheap for us. And therefore, there is a sense that we need tocalibrate.\n\nAMANPOUR: So is right now the net positive for the United States-- the net result positive, or negative, or is the jury still out inthe Middle East in that region?\n\nNASR: I think the jury is still out, because many people assumethat this will be a short-run, very quick, very painless set of eventsthat will end up with a much better Middle East after that. Now we'relooking at a multi-year process that doesn't have a very clear end.And if anybody thought that we will be done with the Middle Eastquickly and we're going to go to China and India, we're going to bebusy with this issue for some time.\n\nAMANPOUR: Gentlemen, thank you both very much, indeed.\n\nStay with us. We're live next from the Vatican where thousandsare celebrating as Pope John Paul II takes one step closer tosainthood. That just after a short break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: We were just speaking about the Arab spring. And wellbefore that uprising, there was the fall of the Iron Curtain, endingcommunism in Eastern Europe. And that, of course, was back in 1989.It was a cause dear to Pope John Paul II.\n\nAnd this was the scene at the Vatican, St. Peter's Square, thismorning, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are on hand as JohnPaul moves one big step closer to sainthood. Our David Wright isthere right now.\n\nDavid?\n\nWRIGHT: Good morning, Christiane.\n\nYou know, the last time all of these people were gathered here tohonor Pope John Paul was, of course, at his funeral six years ago.And you remember then, they were all chanting, \"Santo subito,\"\"Sainthood now.\" Well, today's event is a partial fulfillment of thatdemand. He's not a saint yet, but he has moved a lot closer.\n\nAnd consider: This church took 478 years to beatify Joan of Arc,so for John Paul II, six years is pretty subito.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWRIGHT (voice-over): Six years have passed since the faithfullast gathered in St. Peter's Square to honor Pope John Paul, six yearssince his coffin was closed and placed in the crypt beneath thebasilica, but workers have reverently removed it from its marble tomb.And with cardinals as the foremen, they placed it in front of the Tombof St. Peter.\n\nToday, the closed casket is at the main altar, where John Paullay in state six years ago. Pope Benedict and the cardinals were thefirst to pay their respects.\n\nIn life, he was a towering figure, not just for the church, buton the world stage. In death, there have been questions about hisstewardship of an institution rocked by internal divisions and byscandal.\n\nHe inspired the revolution that ultimately forced the collapse ofcommunism. Shortly after his election, the young pope famouslyexhorted his fellow Poles, do not be afraid. He gave them the courageto rise up, said Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, the Polishworkers first to challenge communist authority.\n\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev later said that the collapse ofthe Iron Curtain would have been impossible without John Paul, but healso had plenty of detractors because of his handling of the massivechurch abuse scandal that happened on his watch.\n\nWAUCK: The people who are shouting \"Santo subito,\" as far as Ican tell, are still shouting, \"Santo subito.\"\n\nWRIGHT (on-screen): But there are some people who are saying,\"Hold the halo.\"\n\nWAUCK: The same people who are saying \"Hold the halo\" now Ithink were the people who would have been saying it five years ago.\n\nWRIGHT (voice-over): \"His name will forever be blessed,\" PopeBenedict proclaimed at today's beatification mass. At that moment, anenormous tapestry unfurled. Blessed Pope John Paul is now well on hisway to sainthood.\n\nWILLIAMS: In practical terms, to declare a person blessed orbeatified means that they're in heaven. It's really just a statementby the church. It's a recognition of heroic virtue, of a life ofsanctity, of holiness, and that this person is with God.\n\nWRIGHT: Investigators have pored over his life for the past fiveyears looking not just at his promotion of world peace, but also atthe moral example he set in public and private. For instance, afterthat assassination attempt in 1981, Pope John Paul was criticallywounded. Later, he sat down with the man who shot him and offeredforgiveness. WAUCK: One of the most heroic acts of virtue that exists isforgiveness. And to forgive someone who tried to kill you -- andalmost did -- I mean, it doesn't get much more powerful than that.\n\nWRIGHT: Under the Vatican process, heroic virtues aren't enough.\n\nSARNO: For beatification and canonization, the church requires aphysical miracle, a healing or some physical reality that can bemeasured.\n\nWRIGHT: This French nun says she was cured of Parkinson'sdisease after she and members of her convent prayed to the late pope.At today's mass, Sister Marie Simon-Pierre carried a relic of JohnPaul, a vial of his blood extracted during his long illness.\n\nBut there are also detractors.\n\n(on-screen): So you're not a big fan of Santo subito in thiscase?\n\nLYNAUGH: No, I have deep reservations.\n\nWRIGHT (voice-over): Joe Lynaugh is one of many Catholics whosay the speed of John Paul's fast-tracked sainthood is an insult tothe victims of sexual abuse.\n\nLYNAUGH: I guarantee you that the argument will be made thatthese issues have been settled or have been almost settled because wehave beatified John Paul.\n\nWRIGHT: Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., insists thescandal did not diminish John Paul's obvious sanctity.\n\n(on-screen): At the same time, there is a groundswell of peoplethat are saying, \"Not so subito.\"\n\nWUERL: Everybody on this planet recognized that this man, JohnPaul, was a man of God. He had a close relationship with God. Andthe church is simply recognizing officially what everybody in theirhearts knows.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWRIGHT: People have been pointing out that the fast track tosainthood is really one of the more democratic things in aninstitution that is almost definitively top down. Keep in mind itwasn't the bishops and the cardinals chanting \"Santo subito.\" It wasthe people, and the church today is partially ratifying that wish.And now all that remains is another miracle, and people here arepraying and waiting for that before John Paul gets declared a saint.\n\nChristiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Thanks, David, there in Rome. And we'll have more ina moment. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: It's been a costly week in Iraq and Afghanistan. ThePentagon has released the names of 25 servicemembers killed in thepast week.\n\nThat's it for our program. Join me to continue the conversationon Twitter and on abcnews.com, and be sure to tune in for \"World NewsTonight\" for a full report on the day in Rome, as well as the latestfrom Libya. We leave you now with the scene in St. Peter's Squaretoday, as the late Pope John Paul II was beatified, bringing him, aswe say, one step closer to sainthood.\n\nSo for all of us here at \"This Week,\" thank you for watching, andwe hope to see you again next week.",

    "text":"Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m.\n\nAsked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\n\n\nAudience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, \"In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?\"\n\n\n\nObama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but \"hit the glass ceiling.\"\n\n\n\n\"She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation,\" he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. \"And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill.\"\n\n\n\nRomney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs.\n\n\n\nObama jumped in, saying, \"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, \u2018I'll get back to you.\u2019 And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.\"\n\n\n\nDid Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of.\n\n\n\nThe law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate \u2014 making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\n\n\n\nWhat did Romney have to say about it? For a previous fact-check in May, the Obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports.\n\n\n\nIn an April 2012 conference call covered by a Washington Post blogger, a Huffington Post reporter asked an unnamed Romney adviser whether Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The adviser responded, \"Sam (Stein), we\u2019ll get back to you on that.\"\n\n\n\nLater, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul clarified in an email, \"He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.\"\n\n\n\nThe second piece the Obama campaign showed us was a Romney interview by Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Sawyer asked Romney, \" If you were president \u2014 you had been president \u2014 would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?\"\n\n\n\nRomney\u2019s response:\n\nRomney: \"It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago \u2014\"\n\nSawyer: \"But would you have signed it?\"\n\nRomney: \"... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and \u2014 and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to.\"\n\nHere, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law. But he also said he has \"no intention of changing that law.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nObama said that when asked whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, Romney's campaign said, \"I'll get back to you.\" His point was that the campaign was dodging the question.\n\n\n\nIndeed, a Romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would \"get back\" to a reporter about whether he supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. A spokeswoman then said he would not change it, and Romney later said he \"certainly support(s) equal pay for women,\" and has \"no intention of changing that law.\"\n\n\n\nSo Obama is correct about the initial statement, but Romney later clarified by saying he wouldn't change the law. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it \"impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",

    "text":"1:05 P.M. EDT\n\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, wow. (Applause.) Wow. It sounds like you all are already fired up and ready to go. (Applause.) This is amazing. It is truly amazing. And you know what, being here with all of you today, let me tell you, I'm feeling pretty fired up and ready to go myself. I really am. (Applause.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason why we're here today --\n\nAUDIENCE: I love you! (Applause.)\n\nMRS. OBAMA: And we love you, too. And it's not just because we support one extraordinary man -- although, I'll admit, I'm a little biased because I think our President is awesome. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nAnd it's not just because we want to win an election. We are here because of the values we believe in. We're here because of the vision for this country that we all share. We're here because we want all our children to have a good education, right? (Applause.) Schools that push them and inspire them, prepare them for good jobs. We want our parents and our grandparents to retire with dignity -- (applause) -- because we believe that after a lifetime of hard work, they should enjoy their golden years.\n\nWe want to restore that basic middle-class security for our families because we believe that folks shouldn't go bankrupt because they get sick. (Applause.) They shouldn't lose their home because someone loses a job. We believe that responsibility should be rewarded and hard work should pay off.\n\nAnd truly, these are basic American values. They're the same values that so many of us were raised with, including myself. You see, my father was a blue-collar city worker at the city water plant. And my family lived in a little bitty apartment on the South Side of Chicago. And neither of my parents had the chance to go to college. But let me tell you what my parents did do: They saved. They sacrificed. I mean, they poured everything they had into me and my brother. They wanted us to have the kind of education they could only dream of. And while pretty much all of my college tuition came from student loans and grants, my dad still paid a little bitty portion of that tuition himself. And let me tell you, every semester, my dad was determined to pay that bill right on time because he was so proud to be sending his kids to college. (Applause.)\n\nAnd he couldn't bear the thought of me or my brother missing that registration deadline because his check was late. Like so many people in this country, my father took great pride in being able to earn a living that allowed him to handle his responsibility to his family, to pay all of his bills and to pay them on time.\n\nAnd truly, more than anything else, that is what's at stake. It's that fundamental promise that no matter who you are or how you started out, if you work hard, you can build a decent life for yourself and yes, an even better life for your kids. (Applause.)\n\nAnd it is that promise that binds us together as Americans. It's what makes us who we are. And whether it's equal pay for women, or health care for our kids; whether it's tax cuts for middle-class families or student loans for our young people -- (applause) -- that is what my husband has been fighting for every single day as President. Every single day. (Applause.)\n\nAnd let me tell you something -- as First Lady, I have had the chance to see up close and personal what being President looks like, right? I have seen how the issues that come across the President\u2019s desk are always the hard ones.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: You\u2019re beautiful, Michelle! (Applause.)\n\nMRS. OBAMA: But in all seriousness -- (laughter) -- these problems, they\u2019re always the hard ones -- the problems with no clear solutions, the judgment calls where the stakes are so high and there is no margin for error. And as President, you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, all you have to guide you are your life experiences, your values, and your vision for this country. That\u2019s all you have. In the end, when you\u2019re making those impossible choices, it all boils down to who you are and what you stand for.\n\nAnd we all know what Barack Obama is -- who he is. (Applause.) We all know what our President stands for, right? (Applause.) He is the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills. That\u2019s who he is. He\u2019s the grandson of a woman who woke up before dawn every day to catch a bus to her job at the bank. And even though Barack\u2019s grandmother worked hard to help support his family, she was good at her job. Like so many women, she hit that glass ceiling. And men no more qualified than she was were promoted up the ladder ahead of her.\n\nSo believe me, Barack knows what it means when a family struggles. He knows what it means when someone doesn\u2019t have a chance to fulfill their potential. And what you need to know, America -- those are the experiences that have made him the man and the President he is today. (Applause.)\n\nBut I have said this before and will say it again and again: Barack cannot do this alone. And fortunately, he never has. We have always moved this country forward together. And today, more than ever before, Barack needs your help. He needs your help. He needs your help. (Applause.) He needs every single one of you -- every single one of you to give just a little part of your life each week to this campaign.\n\nHe needs you to register those voters. (Applause.) And to all of the college students out there, all of you -- if you're going to be moving over the summer, remember to register at your new address in the fall. You got that? Get that done. (Applause.)\n\nBarack needs you to join one of our neighborhood teams and start organizing in your community. And just let me say, if there have ever been any doubt about the difference that you can make, I just want you to remember that in the end, this all could come down to those few thousand people who register to vote. Think about it. It could all come down to those last few thousand folks who get out to the polls on November the 6th.\n\nAnd when you average that out over this entire state, it might mean registering just one more person in your town. It might mean helping just one more person in your community get out and vote on Election Day. So know this: With every door you knock on, with every call you make, with every conversation you have, I want you to remember that this could be the one that makes the difference. This could be the one. (Applause.) Remember that. That is exactly the kind of impact that each of you can have.\n\nNow, I am not going to kid you. This journey is going to be long. And it is going to be hard. But know that that is how change always happens in this country. And if we keep showing up, if we keep fighting the good fight, then eventually we get there. We always do. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but maybe in our children's lifetimes, maybe in our grandchildren's lifetimes -- because in the end, that's what this is all about.\n\nThat is what I think about when I tuck my girls in at night. I think about the world I want to leave for them and for all of our sons and our daughters. I think about how I want to do for them what my dad did for me. I want to give them a foundation for their dreams. (Applause.) I want to give them opportunities worthy of their promise. I want to give them that sense of limitless possibility, that belief that here in America, there is always something better out there if you're willing to work for it. So we just cannot turn back now, right?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nMRS. OBAMA: We have come so far, but we have so much more to do. And if we want to keep on moving forward then we need to work our hearts out for the man that I have the pleasure of introducing here today. (Applause.) Are you ready?\n\nIt is my privilege to introduce my husband and our President, President Barack Obama!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Ohio! (Applause.) It is good to be back in Ohio! (Applause.) Right before I came out, somebody happened to give me a buckeye for good luck. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you back! Now, before I begin, I want to say thank you to a few people who are joining us here today. Your mayor, Michael Coleman is here. (Applause.) Former Governor Ted Strickland is here. (Applause.) Senator Sherrod Brown is in the house. (Applause.) An American hero, John Glenn is with us. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I want to thank so many of our Neighborhood Team Leaders for being here today. You guys will be the backbone of this campaign. (Applause.) And I want the rest of you to join a team or become a leader yourself, because we are going to win this thing the old-fashioned way -- door by door, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood. (Applause.)\n\nOhio, four years ago, you and I began a journey together.\n\nI didn\u2019t run, and you didn\u2019t work your hearts out, just to win an election. We came together to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth.\n\nWe came together because we believe that in America, your success shouldn\u2019t be determined by the circumstances of your birth. If you\u2019re willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job. If you\u2019re willing to meet your responsibilities, you should be able to own a home, maybe start a business, give your children the chance to do even better -- no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what your last name is. (Applause.)\n\nWe believe the free market is one of the greatest forces for progress in human history; that businesses are the engine of growth; that risk-takers and innovators should be rewarded. But we also believe that at its best, the free market has never been a license to take whatever you want, however you can get it; that alongside our entrepreneurial spirit and our rugged individualism, America only prospers when we meet our obligations to one another and to future generations. (Applause.)\n\nWe came together in 2008 because our country had strayed from these basic values. A record surplus was squandered on tax cuts for people who didn\u2019t need them and weren\u2019t even asking for them. Two wars were being waged on a credit card. Wall Street speculators reaped huge profits by making bets with other people\u2019s money. Manufacturing left our shores. A shrinking number of Americans did fantastically well, while most people struggled with falling incomes, rising costs, the slowest job growth in half a century.\n\nIt was ahouse of cards that collapsed in the most destructive crisis since the Great Depression. In the last six months of 2008, even as we were campaigning, nearly three million of our neighbors lost their jobs. Over 800,000 more were lost in the month I took office alone.\n\nIt was tough. But I tell you what, Ohio -- the American people are tougher. (Applause.) All across this country, people like you dug in. Some of you retrained. Some of you went back to school. Small business owners cut back on expenses, but did everything they could to keep their employees. Yes, there were setbacks. Yes, there were disappointments. But we didn\u2019t quit. We don\u2019t quit. Together, we\u2019re fighting our way back. (Applause.)\n\nWhen some wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt, we made a bet on American workers, on the ingenuity of American companies. And today, our auto industry is back on top of the world. (Applause.) Manufacturers started investing again, adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. Businesses got back to the basics, exports surged. And over four million jobs were created in the last two years -- more than one million of those in the last six months alone. (Applause.) Are we satisfied?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Of course not. Too many of our friends and family are still out there looking for work. The housing market is still weak, deficits are still too high, and states are still laying off teachers, first responders. This crisis took years to develop, and the economy is still facing headwinds. And it will take sustained, persistent effort -- yours and mine -- for America to fully recover. That\u2019s the truth. We all know it.\n\nBut we are making progress. And now we face a choice. (Applause.) Now we face a choice, Ohio.\n\nCHILD: We love you, Barack Obama!\n\nAUDIENCE: Awww --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) Thank you. Now we face a choice. For the last few years, the Republicans who run this Congress have insisted that we go right back to the policies that created this mess.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But to borrow a line from my friend Bill Clinton, now their agenda is on steroids. (Applause.) This time, they want even bigger tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. This time, they want even deeper cuts to things like education and Medicare, and research and technology.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This time, they want to give banks and insurance companies even more power to do as they please. And now, after a long and spirited primary, Republicans in Congress have found a nominee for President who has promised to rubber-stamp this agenda if he gets the chance.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ohio, I tell you what: We cannot give him that chance. (Applause.) Not now. Not with so much at stake. This is not just another election. This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and we\u2019ve been through too much to turn back now. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We have come too far to abandon the change we fought for these past few years. We have to move forward, to the future we imagined in 2008, where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. (Applause.) That\u2019s the choice in this election, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for a second term as President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nGovernor Romney is a patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family, and he has much to be proud of. He\u2019s run a large financial firm, and he\u2019s run a state. But I think he has drawn the wrong lessons from those experiences. He sincerely believes that if CEOs and wealthy investors like him make money, the rest of us will automatically prosper as well.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: When a woman in Iowa shared the story of her financial struggles, he responded with economic theory. He told her, \u201cour productivity equals our income.\u201d Well, let me tell you something. The problem with our economy isn\u2019t that the American people aren\u2019t productive enough -- you\u2019ve been working harder than ever. (Applause.) The challenge we face right now -- the challenge we faced for over a decade is that harder work hasn\u2019t led to higher incomes. It\u2019s that bigger profits haven\u2019t led to better jobs. (Applause.)\n\nGovernor Romney doesn\u2019t seem to get that. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary -- whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union-busting -- might not always be good for the average American or for the American economy.\n\nWhy else would he want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would he propose cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families? Why else would he want to slash the investments that have always helped the economy grow, but at the same time, stop regulating the reckless behavior on Wall Street that helped the economy crash?\n\nSomehow, he and his friends in Congress think that the same bad ideas will lead to a different result. Or they\u2019re just hoping you won\u2019t remember what happened the last time we tried it their way.\n\nWell, Ohio, I\u2019m here to say that we were there, we remember, and we are not going back. We are moving this country forward. (Applause.)\n\nLook, we want businesses to succeed. We want entrepreneurs and investors rewarded when they take risks, when they create jobs and grow our economy. But the true measure of our prosperity is more than just a running tally of every balance sheet and quarterly profit report. I don\u2019t care how many ways you try to explain it: Corporations aren\u2019t people. People are people. (Applause.)\n\nWe measure prosperity not just by our total GDP; not just by how many billionaires we produce, but how well the typical family is doing -- whether they can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them.\n\nAnd we understand that in this country, people succeed when they have a chance to get a decent education and learn new skills -- and, by the way, so do the businesses that hire them or the companies that they start. (Applause.)\n\nWe know that our economy grows when we support research into medical breakthroughs and new technologies that lead to the next Internet app or life-saving drug.\n\nWe know that our country is stronger when we can count on affordable health insurance and Medicare and Social Security. (Applause.) When we protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution. When there are rules to make sure we aren\u2019t taken advantage of by credit card companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions. And we know these rules aren\u2019t just good for seniors, or kids, or consumers -- they're good for business, too. They're part of what makes the market work.\n\nLook, we don\u2019t expect government to solve all our problems, and it shouldn\u2019t try. I learned from my mom that no education policy can take the place of a parent\u2019s love and affection. (Applause.) As a young man, I worked with a group of Catholic churches who taught me that no poverty program can make as much of a difference as the kindness and commitment of a caring soul. (Applause.) Not every regulation is smart. Not every tax dollar is spent wisely. Not every person can be helped who refuses to help themselves.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an excuse to tell the vast majority of responsible, hardworking Americans, \u201cYou\u2019re on your own.\u201d That unless you\u2019re lucky enough to have parents who can lend you money, you may not be able to go to college. That even if you pay your premiums every month, you\u2019re out of luck if an insurance company decides to drop your coverage when you need it most.\n\nThat\u2019s not how we built America. That\u2019s not who we are. We built this country together. (Applause.) We built this country together.\n\nWe built railroads and highways; the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge -- together. We sent my grandfather\u2019s generation to college on the GI Bill -- together. We instituted a minimum wage and worker safety laws -- together. Together, we touched the surface of the moon, unlocked the mystery of the atom, connected the world through our own science and imagination. We did these things together -- not because they benefited any particular individual or group, but because they made us all richer. Because they gave us all opportunity. Because they moved us forward together -- as one people, as one nation. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s the true lesson of our past, Ohio. That\u2019s the right vision for our future. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President. (Applause.)\n\nI\u2019m running to make sure that by the end of the decade, more of our citizens hold a college degree than any other nation on Earth. (Applause.) I want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers, especially in math and science. (Applause.) I want to give two million more Americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn the skills that local businesses are looking for right now. In the 21st century, higher education can\u2019t be a luxury -- it is an economic imperative that every American should be able to afford. That\u2019s the choice in this election. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President. (Applause.)\n\nI\u2019m running to make sure the next generation of high-tech manufacturing takes root in places like Columbus and Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Richmond. I want to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs and profits overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America. That\u2019s the choice in this election. (Applause.)\n\nI\u2019m running so that we can keep moving towards a future where we control our own energy. Our dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest point in 16 years. (Applause.) By the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon. Thousands of Americans have jobs, right now, because the production of renewal energy in this country has nearly doubled in just three years. (Applause.)\n\nSo now is not the time to cut these investments to pay for another $4 billion giveaway to the oil companies. Now is the time to end the subsidies for an industry that\u2019s rarely been more profitable. (Applause.) Let\u2019s double down on a clean energy future that\u2019s never been more promising -- for our economy, and for our security, and for the safety of our planet. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President. That\u2019s the choice in this election, Ohio. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. (Applause.) Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to this country. (Applause.) Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat. And by 2014, the war in Afghanistan will be over. (Applause.)\n\nAmerica is safer and more respected because of the courage and selflessness of the United States Armed Forces. (Applause.) And as long as I\u2019m Commander-in-Chief, this country will care for our veterans and serve our veterans as well as they\u2019ve served us -- (applause) -- because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home. (Applause.)\n\nMy opponent said it was \u201ctragic\u201d to end the war in Iraq. He said he won\u2019t set a timeline for ending the war in Afghanistan.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I have, and I intend to keep it. (Applause.) After a decade of war that\u2019s cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, the nation we need to build is our own. (Applause.) I will use half of what we\u2019re no longer spending on war to pay down the deficit, and the other half to repair our roads and our bridges, our runways and our wireless networks. That\u2019s the choice in this election -- to rebuild America. (Applause.)\n\nI\u2019m running to pay down our debt in a way that\u2019s balanced and responsible. After inheriting a $1 trillion deficit, I signed $2 trillion of spending cuts into law. And now I want to finish the job by streamlining government and cutting more waste, and reforming our tax code so that it is simpler and fairer, and asks the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)\n\nMy opponent won\u2019t tell us how he\u2019d pay for his new,\n\n$5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But we know the bill for that tax cut will either be passed on to our children, or it will be paid for by a whole lot of ordinary Americans. That\u2019s what we know. And I refuse to let that happen again. (Applause.)\n\nI refuse to pay for another millionaire\u2019s tax cut by eliminating medical research projects into things like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I refuse to pay for another tax cut by kicking children off of Head Start programs; or asking students to pay more for college; or eliminating health insurance for millions of poor and elderly and disabled Americans on Medicaid. (Applause.)\n\nAnd as long as I\u2019m President of the United States, I will never allow Medicare to be turned into a voucher that would end the program as we know it. (Applause.) We will not go back to the days when our citizens spent their golden years at the mercy of private insurance companies. We will reform Medicare -- not by shifting the cost of care to seniors, but by reducing the spending that isn\u2019t making people healthier. (Applause.) That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in this election. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake, Ohio.\n\nOn issue after issue, we can\u2019t afford to spend the next four years going backward. America doesn\u2019t need to refight the battles we just had over Wall Street reform and health care reform. On health care reform, here is what I know: Allowing 2.5 million young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plan -- that was the right thing to do. (Applause.) Cutting prescription drug costs for seniors -- that was the right thing to do. (Applause.) I will not go back to the days when insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, or deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men. We\u2019re not going back there. We\u2019re going forward. (Applause.)\n\nWe don\u2019t need another political fight about ending a woman\u2019s right to choose, or getting rid of Planned Parenthood -- (applause) -- or taking away access to affordable birth control. I want women to control their own health choices, just like I want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons. (Applause.) We are not turning back the clock. We are moving forward. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re not returning to the days when you could be kicked out of the United States military just because of who you are or who you love. (Applause.) That would be wrong for our national security, and it would be a betrayal of our values.\n\nThis should be the last election where multimillion-dollar donations speak louder than the voices of ordinary citizens. (Applause.) We need more checks on lobbyists and special interests, not less.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to eliminate the EPA. We\u2019re not going to roll back the bargaining rights that generations of workers fought for. (Applause.) It\u2019s time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because they\u2019re the children of undocumented immigrants. (Applause.) This country is at its best when we harness the God-given talents of every individual; when we hear every voice; when we come together as one American family, striving for the same dream.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for. That's what we're fighting for, Ohio. A bold America. A competitive America. A generous America. A forward-looking America, where everybody has a chance to make of their life what they will. That\u2019s what made us the envy of the world. That\u2019s what makes us great. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running again for President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And that is why I need your help. Ohio, this election will be even closer than the last. Too many of our friends, too many of our neighbors are still hurting because of this crisis. I've heard from too many people wondering why they haven't been able to get one of the jobs that have been created; why their home is still under water; why their family hasn't yet been touched by the recovery.\n\nThe other side won't be offering these Americans a real answer to these questions. They won't offer a better vision or a new set of ideas. But they will be spending more money than we've ever seen before on negative ads, on TV, on radio, in the mail, on the Internet -- ads that exploit people's frustrations for my opponent's political gain. Over and over again, they will tell you that America is down and out, and they'll tell you who to blame, and ask if you\u2019re better off than you were before the worst crisis in our lifetime.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that play before. But you know what? The real question -- the question that will actually make a difference in your life and in the lives of your children -- is not just about how we\u2019re doing today. It\u2019s about how we\u2019ll be doing tomorrow.\n\nWill we better off if more Americans get a better education? That\u2019s the question. Will we better off if we depend less on foreign oil and more on our own ingenuity? That's the question. (Applause.) Will we better off if we start doing some nation-building right here at home? That's the question. Will we be better off if we bring down our deficit without gutting the very things we need to grow? When we look back four years from now, or ten years from now, or twenty years from now, won\u2019t we be better off if we have the courage to keep moving forward? (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s the question in this election. That's the question in this election. And the outcome is entirely up to you. Now, sure, we\u2019ll have to contend with even more negative ads, with even more cynicism and nastiness, and sometimes just plain foolishness. There will be more of that than we saw in the last campaign.\n\nBut if there is one thing that we learned in 2008, it\u2019s that nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change. (Applause.) When enough of you knock on doors, when you pick up phones, when you talk to your friends, when you decide that it\u2019s time for change to happen, guess what? Change happens. Change comes to America. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s the spirit we need again. If people ask you what this campaign is about, you tell them it\u2019s still about hope. You tell them it\u2019s still about change. You tell them it\u2019s still about ordinary people who believe that in the face of great odds, we can make a difference in the life of this country. (Applause.)\n\nBecause I still believe, Ohio. I still believe that we are not as divided as our politics suggest. I still believe that we have more in common than the pundits tell us; that we're not Democrats or Republicans, but Americans first and foremost. (Applause.) I still believe in you, and I\u2019m asking you to keep believing in me. (Applause.) I told you in 2008 that I wasn\u2019t a perfect man, and I would never be a perfect President. But I promised that I would always tell you what I thought. I would always tell you where I stood. And I would wake up every single day fighting for you as hard as I know how. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I have that kept that promise. I have kept that promise, Ohio. And I will keep it so long as I have the honor of being your President. So if you\u2019re willing to stick with me, if you're willing to fight with me, and press on with me; if you\u2019re willing to work even harder in this election than you did in the last election, I guarantee you -- we will move this country forward. (Applause.)\n\nWe will finish what we started. We are still fired up. We are still ready to go. And we are going to remind the world once more just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)\n\nThank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\n\nEND 1:55 P.M. EDT",

    "text":"It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47.\n\nI believe strongly that they should. And so do the 500 mayors who are members of our bi-partisan coalition of Mayor Against Illegal Guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is time to close the \"Terror Gap\" in our gun laws.\n\nThis morning I will be testifying at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about the easy access that terror suspects have to guns and explosives. I wanted to share with lawmakers the hard-earned perspective New Yorkers have on this national security risk.\n\nThe car bomb the New York City Police Department found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9\/11 -- far from it. And sadly, it won't be the last.\n\nSince 1990, there have been more than 20 terrorists plots -- or actual attacks -- against our city.\n\nIn the last year alone, the NYPD -- working closely with federal authorities -- prevented two major planned attacks on our City. The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx.\n\nThe second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York.\n\nLast June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another. At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport. He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts.\n\nAnd on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13. We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism.\n\nThe Bush Administration first proposed closing the Terror Gap in 2007. But because Congress has failed to act on that proposal, people who may want to do our country harm have been able to buy guns and explosives.\n\nToday, the Government Accountability Office has released new data showing that suspects on the terrorism watch lists were able to buy guns and explosives from licensed US dealers 1,119 times between 2004 and 2010.\n\nThat is a serious and dangerous breach of national security.\n\nThat's why the more than 500 mayors in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that I co-chair with Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, support legislation to close the Terror Gap. This issue is a centerpiece of the coalition's fight to strengthen the federal background check system. Today, we have launched a new website -- www.TerrorGap.org -- to help educate Congress and the public about the Terror Gap and its consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis legislation would give FBI agents the authority to block terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. It would also give them the ability to make exceptions when they determine that blocking a sale might tip off a suspect who is under investigation.\n\nAnd the bill also allows those on the list to appeal their status to the Justice Department -- and challenge the determination in court.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder supported closing the Terror Gap in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. And so does the vast majority of Americans.\n\nA December poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that 82% of NRA members, and 86% of other gun owners, support closing the Terror Gap.\n\nTo learn more and take action, please visit: www.TerrorGap.org.\n\nIn New York City, we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent another terrorist attack. Under Commissioner Kelly's leadership, the NYPD has developed one of the world's most advanced counter-terrorism programs. One thousand of our best officers work on counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts every day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA key element of any smart counter-terrorism strategy is to make it harder for terrorists to strike.\n\nThat's why air passengers walk through metal detectors.\n\nThat's why our police officers randomly check bags in the subway.\n\nThat's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations.\n\nAnd that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives.",

    "text":"The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella.\n\nThat\u2019s how onerous and confounding the nation\u2019s tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for \"meaningful tax reform\" and blasting the complexity of the tax code.\n\n\"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news,\" Lance said in the news release.\n\nBut not all the news is bad for Lance.\n\nLet\u2019s first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible.\n\nA 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Taxpayer\u2019s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word\u2019s word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at \u2018about 4 million.\u2019\n\nWe also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business.\n\nSo Lance\u2019s claim about the number of words is generally accurate.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, Lance\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nMark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publisher\u2019s version of the tax code is 5,036 pages.\n\n\"Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then you\u2019re looking at one private publisher\u2019s version of the code,\" he said. \"We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it.\"\n\nThe key point here? Letter size, font and spacing matter when counting pages in the tax code and even in the Bible.\n\nDennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary said an approximation of 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined is fair.\n\n\"The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,\" Olson said in an e-mail.\n\nHellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, said there\u2019s no standard way to measure the size of the Bible, given its numerous translations and texts but said she, too, was aware of estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words.\n\nMardaga also noted that dividing 4 million \u2013 the number of words in the tax code \u2013 by 800,000 - would mean the tax code is five times longer than the Bible -- not Lance\u2019s seven.\n\nWe looked at versions of the King James and New American Standard versions of the Bible on Amazon.com, an online retailer of books and other merchandise. The four Bibles we looked at ranged in size from 512 pages to 1,112. Accordingly, Mitchell said he has seen numerous references comparing the size of the tax code with the Bible, ranging from 4 times as long to 10 times as long. Seven, he said, is in the middle.\n\n\"It all depends on what version (of the Bible) you have in front of you,\" he said. \"I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a right or wrong answer to the question.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLance said, \"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news.\"\n\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that the code is about 4 million words in length, according to previous published reports and the publisher of the 2013 winter version of the tax code. Lance also based his figure of 5,600 pages on previous reports from publications such as the Harvard Business Review. Opinions also differ on the code\u2019s length when compared with the Bible, given the many versions, translations and texts of it. And while the tax code isn\u2019t seven times as long as the Bible, even given a standard word count for the good book, we get Lance\u2019s overall point: the tax code is long and complex. We rate his claim Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.",

Gary Johnson \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Aug 5, 2016 3 min read -- 18 Listen Share\n\nWhen it comes to electing their next president, Americans want a candidate to vote for \u2014 not just someone to vote against.\n\nAmerican voters want the perspective of an outsider who can bring an entrepreneurial perspective to the White House. They aren\u2019t opposed to experience in governing \u2014 so long as it doesn\u2019t bring with it an addiction to crony capitalism and the fruits thereof.\n\nAnd they want a candidate who looks after American interests and doesn\u2019t use war to destabilize already volatile regions of the world like the Middle East.\n\nI\u2019m running for President to offer that alternative. I am a successful businessman, and grew my construction business to employ more than 1,000 workers.\n\nI was the Republican governor of the heavily Democratic state of New Mexico. I focused on good government and I got it done \u2014 just like my running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. The people of New Mexico reelected me by a comfortable margin. Ditto for Weld.\n\nThink of it this way: I\u2019m someone you would trust to run your household and to keep it safe while you went away on a trip or a vacation. I could even fix a few things around the house. After all, the construction company I founded began as a one-man handy-man operation. Can you say the same for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?\n\nI\u2019ve balanced budgets and cut taxes. I\u2019ve also spoken my mind about where the country needed to go on personal freedoms and marriage equality. In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana. Senator Bernie Sanders came to that viewpoint \u2014 a position that most Americans support \u2014 16 years later.\n\nI\u2019m also a strong believer in our Constitutional rights to civil liberties and privacy. Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nAnd I understand that, as a nation and as a society, we have unfinished business to right the wrongs of injustice suffered by minorities. Blacks are 30 percent more likely that white to be apprehended by the police; they are three times more likely to be searched; they are arrested twice as often as whites; and they are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nIt is not surprising that there is tangible mistrust, tension and frustration between the police and African-Americans, particularly black males. We need to speak honestly about these issues in order to address them. Let\u2019s be honest. We have healing to do.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns that many voters have with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but particularly with Ms. Clinton, is the sense that she uses government power to advance her personal and political interests.\n\nShe is the very status quo. Americans want that changed. She talks about progressivism, but lines her bank accounts with speaking fees from banks and special interests. That\u2019s what crony capitalism is all about. Americans recognize pay-to-play when they see it, and they are really, really weary of it.\n\nHaving been governor of New Mexico, I know that legislation gets passed to benefit those who have money and influence. Then they buy more money and influence. That\u2019s one reason why, as governor, I vetoed more than 750 bills and thousands of line items.\n\nI did it to keep crony capitalism away from government.\n\nAnother big difference between Hillary Clinton and myself is that I\u2019m for our national tradition of peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations \u2014 while being extremely skeptical of committing ourselves and our armed forces to foreign conflicts.\n\nAs a Senator, she endorsed ill-advised foreign interventions. As Secretary of State, she was the architect of tragic and counter-productive policies in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. These should not be America\u2019s wars, and we ought not be prompting regime changes that serve only to replace bad actors with even worse actors and instability that makes us less safe.\n\nInstead, our nation need the confidence that its president will be predictable, yes, but also skeptical of engaging in international shenanigans all around the world.\n\nAmericans can find sanity and principle by voting Johnson\/Weld in 2016.",

    "text":"In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump.\n\n\n\n\"We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,\" he said. \"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\n\n\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",

    "text":"Updated: ASPEN \u2014 Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.\n\nThey gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.\n\nAnd at a fund-raising event earlier in the day \u2014 one of three \u2013he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I relish and that\u2019s what I like,\u2019\u2019 he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is \u201cabout the size of Senator Obama\u2019s foreign-policy team.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nMany on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.\n\nMr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, \u201cthe first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cThis is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, \u201cI have to be against the tax increases, as you know,\u201d and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it\u2019s closer to $5 a gallon.\n\nAt one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his \u201cmaverick\u201d stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?\n\nIn a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the \u201cChristian right.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush\u2019s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.\n\nAs for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a \u201ctraitor,\u201d Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.\n\nHe said he himself had been called \u201cdisloyal\u201d by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn\u2019t work. He said he had been \u201cdeclared dead,\u201d but he was reminded of Chairman Mao\u2019s saying that \u201cit\u2019s always darkest before it\u2019s totally black.\u201d But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, \u201che voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.\u201d He added: \u201cI think he\u2019s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,\u201d he said, to sustained applause.\n\nHe also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9\/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, \u201cwe passed up an opportunity\u201d to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.\n\nHe also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cThe kind of war they\u2019re fighting requires long-term commitment,\u201d he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.\n\nOn the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA\u2019s \u201cDancing Queen\u201d was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d\n\nHe said that if he\u2019s \u201clacking in anything,\u201d it is an appreciation for music and art and \u201cthe other great things in life,\u201d partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.\n\n\u201cEverybody says, \u2018I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.\u2019How come everybody goes to \u2018Mamma Mia!?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody goes! They\u2019ve been selling out for years.\u201d\n\nAfter another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.\n\n\u201cI appreciate art,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m going to do and I have the opportunity, it\u2019s to take a class in art.\u201d He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, \u201cbut some of the things weren\u2019t there that I would like to see.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I make no excuses for my taste in music.\u201d",

Don\u2019t listen to the rhetoric,\" he said. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment.\n\n\n\n\"Forty-seven million people on food stamps,\" Cain said. \"That\u2019s 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over.\"\n\n\n\nFood stamps? your PolitiFact Georgia scribes wondered. What\u2019s with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately?\n\n\n\nLast week, the state\u2019s other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called \"the most successful food stamp president in American history\" because \"47 million Americans are on food stamps.\"\n\n\n\nWe ruled Gingrich\u2019s statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame.\n\n\n\nCain, a former radio talk show host and Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to \"look at the facts.\" PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him.\n\n\n\nFood stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries.\n\n\n\nThe most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available.\n\n\n\nCain\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t quite accurate, but he\u2019s close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high.\n\n\n\nThe number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, February\u2019s count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969.\n\n\n\nObama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration.\n\n\n\nCain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, he\u2019s close, but not quite right.\n\n\n\nWhether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear.\n\n\n\nThe rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell.\n\n\n\nThe number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama.\n\n\n\nAnother reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two.\n\n\n\nCain\u2019s accusation against Obama was not as barbed as Gingrich\u2019s, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the president\u2019s feet. We therefore give the presidential candidate a Mostly True.",

They're the majority of the new small business starts. That is why women are looking at this and they're saying, look, my household income is down forty-three hundred dollars a year. Twenty-six hundred dollars a year is what I'm seeing as the increase in my health insurance. I am trying to get access to capital to grow this small business. The Obama economy is working against me. We've got to make some changes. Tell me what you're going to do about it.\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: And, Bob, you-- in your commentary you talked about how Americans were just sort of sick and tired of politics generally. I-- I agree with that. And I think that it's really an indictment on Barack Obama because he promised he was going to carpet the world. He was going to be a transcendent figure. He didn't get it done. And I think of all the things that this election is--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Oh, come now. I mean--\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: Listen--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: --I-- I take your point, but you're not trying to tell me that the reason people are sick of politics is all--\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: No.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: --all the Democrats' fault and the--\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: No, no, no.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: --Republicans have nothing.\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: No, I'm not saying that. But-- but hear me out. I think Barack Obama's not real anymore to the American people. They bought-- they bought a message in 2008. And I think of all the things that people are starving for in this country are real, authentic people that make a promise and keep a promise. The Barack Obama brand is broken. And-- and-- and that is an indictment on Barack Obama. Now I think there is a lot of work to be done in Washington. I think we do need people of their word to go do what they said they're going to do. But at the top of the ticket is a man who sold us a bill of goods, and delivered on very little and that's going to be his biggest problem.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: But isn't this just kind of a-- a-- couldn't you say the same thing? Because what happens is, people come, they make these promises, both sides do it, and then nothing happens. I mean you have a Congress--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: Well--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: --that has done nothing.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: Well-- well, I take-- I'll take issue with that. The House has over thirty jobs bills and about two hundred pieces of legislation waiting for Harry Reid and the Democrat Senate to take it up. So take a little bit of issue with that. The House is what--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Well, but the Democrats there have some bills--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: But then, look at this, in your commentary you said you wanted to see a leader who could sit down with the other side and get things done.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: Look at what Mitt Romney did in Massachusetts. He said as he exactly what he did. Republican governor, he went to a Democratic legislature, and he said for the good of the state, and the people of this state, let's decide how we can get some things done. So if you're looking for somebody who can actually live that out for you, your guy is Mitt Romney.\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: And that's what a convention is all about, telling the Mitt Romney story about a good, decent man that gave away his father's inheritance and everything he did, he did with-- to success. And I think that both Republican and Democratic parents are wishing for their kids' success and the American dream, and not the glass-half-empty America that Barack Obama is trying to sell this country.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Governor Barbour, yeah, you've been a governor, you've been a longtime lobbyist, you've been involved in politics for a long, long time. If you were just to sit here today and say what is something that the two sides could get together on--and I'd like to hear from you, Congressman Blackburn--just give me some things that they could do if they could just sit down and-- and do it in a rational way.\n\nHALEY BARBOUR: You know, Bob, the answer is just probably a very long list. In divided government, like under Reagan, like under Bill Clinton, when you had a majority of the House--Democrats were under Reagan they did the Reagan economic plan. They did Social Security reform. They did immigration reform. They did the 1986 Tax Reform Bill because you had a President who was willing to lead and work the other side. It's not partisan. Bill Clinton was the same way. Bill Clinton had six years of Republican Congress. He didn't whine and complain and blame everybody else. He went over to the Republican Congress and he did welfare reform and the first balanced budget in a generation because he was willing to lead. That's what the American people-- you talked about it in your commentary. The American people want to know why don't we have a Bill Clinton, why don't we have a Ronald Reagan, that will go to the other side and get things done rather than make everything political, everything somebody else's fault.

They carry a 3.75% interest rate and can be cashed in October, by which time California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is hoping that he will have some money.\n\nEntrepreneurs have been quick to leap on the phenomenon, with Craigslist and eBay cluttered with offers. A website, BuyMyIOU.com, aims to match sellers of the warrants with buyers eager to snap up the above-market interest rate.\n\n\"The market's at an early stage \u2013 we're really in the infancy of it right now,\" said Mark Granger, president of Pacific West Managers, a finance company offering to buy IOUs. \"It's a little unusual to see the state of California resorting to paying its bills like this.\"\n\nCalifornia is the world's eighth largest economy but its financial situation is grave. The once booming property market has been hit catastrophically by foreclosures and its wealthy elite have seen their income wiped out by stockmarket woes. Usually 1% of the population contribute 50% of income tax revenue, but the capital gains of these rich individuals have evaporated.\n\nDismal relations between Democrats and Republicans have all but frozen business in the state capital, Sacramento. A two-thirds majority is required to pass any budget, but Republicans, with just over a third of the legislature, are refusing to countenance tax rises while the Democrats are balking at spending cuts.\n\nSchwarzenegger has proposed deep cuts to social programmes, including aid for the elderly, disabled and impoverished, plus cuts to schools, healthcare and universities. Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San Jos\u00e9 State University, says this will accentuate an already yawning gap between the rich and poor: \"The state is quickly becoming an hourglass economy. The middle class is all but evaporating \u2013 people are either moving further to the top or sinking to the bottom.\"\n\nThe initial victims of the standoff are California's creditors, who had received 91,000 IOUs worth $354m as of the end of Thursday. High-street banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, agreed to cash them for a few days but announced that they would not accept them beyond the end of the week.\n\n\"There's a sentiment inside the banks that the longer they accept the warrants, the longer the budget impasse will go on,\" said Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the Californian Bankers Association.\n\nThat leaves IOU holders with limited options. Certain local credit unions are still taking the notes at face value. Beyond that, holders face a choice of either waiting until October to receive their money or selling them at a discount on a rapidly developing informal market.\n\nMany online offers for the IOUs propose dubious rates. On eBay, one buyer was willing to pay $140 in return for $170 worth of IOUs. Granger, whose firm sees the debt crisis as a potentially lucrative opportunity, said a market rate was emerging of between 80 and 95 cents on the dollar. \"Because they're cumbersome and troublesome to deal with, a lot of the big investment houses are not going to deal with them,\" he said. \"And some people will just put them in their piggy banks.\"\n\nLast week, the credit agency Fitch cut its rating on California's debt by two notches from \"A minus\" to BBB - just two levels above \"junk\" status. Analysts fear that there could be weeks of IOUs to come.\n\nGerston says a confrontational culture of extreme left-wing and right-wing politics has contributed to the morass, as has a reluctance to wake up to problems: \"Californians are known as laidback for a reason they've earned that reputation. Most people just don't believe what's in front of them. They just don't buy it.\"",

Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.\n\nThe video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.\n\nClaiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.\n\n3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com\/2KMpzYf3ui \u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016\n\nThe clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.\n\n\u201cYesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,\u201d Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d\n\nThe al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.\n\n\u201cISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups \u2014 they don\u2019t want Trump in office,\u201d said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. \u201cThey want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.\u201d ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nSarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is \u201cscared to death of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a threat to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.\u201d\n\nSome voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump\u2019s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThe terrorists fear Trump right now. They\u2019re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u201d\n\nThe propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word \u201chell,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.\n\n\u201cI would hate to do it, but it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred \u2014 the absolute hatred \u2014 is coming from these areas,\u201d Trump said in an interview on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (Video: ABC News\/NBC News)\n\nThe video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump\u2019s language aids jihadists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out \u2014 video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,\u201d Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. \u201c \u2018No Muslims coming to the United States,\u2019 other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements \u2014 it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Clinton added, \u201clights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.\u201d\n\nTrump responded to Clinton\u2019s assertion by calling her \u201ca liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another Hillary lie,\u201d Trump said on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d late last month. \u201cShe\u2019s a liar, and everybody knows that.\u201d\n\nDavid Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.\n\nMORE READING:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "text":"Story highlights The Trump transition team says his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump promised to force Mexico to pay for the wall\n\nWashington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.\n\nThe move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.\n\nTrump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.\n\n\u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d Trump tweeted Friday.\n\nThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017\n\nNew York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand that Mexico\u2019s economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,\u201d Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cOn the trade negotiation side, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it\u2019s in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.\u201d\n\nThe Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they\u2019d like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.\n\nIntel report says US identifies go-betweens who gave emails to WikiLeaks\n\n\u201cIt was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that\u2019s already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to secure the border,\u201d Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.\n\nMesser admitted it\u2019s \u201cbig dollars, but it\u2019s a question of priorities.\u201d He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.\n\n\u201cDemocrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,\u201d Messer said.\n\nMexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.\n\nThe Associated Press and Politico first reported elements of the talks earlier Thursday.\n\nIf Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.\n\nNo decisions have been made, GOP sources said.\n\nRepublicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.\n\nThe thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.\n\nBlack Caucus launches longshot effort to derail Sessions\u2019 nomination as attorney general\n\nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.\n\n\u201cWe want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cWe\u2019re in talks with him on the details of it as they\u2019re still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there\u2019s another funding bill that\u2019s going to move. We\u2019re going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.\u201d\n\nCould Mexico pay for the border wall?\n\nTrump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion. And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall\u2019s full cost.\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s website, those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.\n\nA major challenge for judging Trump\u2019s proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket \u2013 less than $1 billion \u2013 compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money \u2013 remittance seizure \u2013 would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.\n\nTotal US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ($186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it\u2019s difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports \u2013 or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff \u2013 without the specifics of the tax.\n\nMoving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that \u201ceven a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year.\u201d But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year \u2013 and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees \u2013 that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.\n\nThe biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.\n\nAccording to the bank of Mexico, Mexico received $24.8 billion in remittance payments in 2015. A Fox News Latino report calculated that 97% of remittance payments received by Mexico in the first three months of 2015 came from the US, and the Pew Research Center similarly reported that \u201cnearly all\u201d of Mexico\u2019s remittance payment revenue comes from the U.S.\u201d Seizing all of that money would probably be more than enough to pay for the border wall.\n\nTrump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump\u2019s plan would likely face multiple legal battles.\n\n\u201cThe Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the \u2018Radical Islamic Terrorists\u2019 that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,\u201d says Callan. \u201cThe courts are likely to view Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.\u201d\n\nThe size of Mexico\u2019s remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it\u2019s difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.",

    "text":"In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump.\n\n\n\n\"We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,\" he said. \"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\n\n\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",

Bad news for President Obama.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: This weekend marks a major milestone in the seven-year war in Iraq. U.S. forces have now handed over control of all combat duties to Iraqi forces, and by the end of this month, all U.S. combat forces will be out. A transitional force of about 50,000 troops will remain, though.\n\nEarlier this week, President Obama spelled out their mission.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Our forces will have a focused mission -- supporting and training Iraqi forces; partnering with Iraqis in counter-terrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts. But make no mistake: Our commitment in Iraq is changing from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: But five months after elections, Iraqi politicians have not yet formed a government, and violence continues. Last night, three explosions at a market in southern Iraq killed dozens of people. And today, two car bombs went off west of Baghdad.\n\nJoining me this morning from Baghdad, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, General Ray Odierno. General Odierno, thank you very much for joining us on \"This Week.\"\n\nAnd I want to start by asking you about the handover. You have just handed over all combat operations to Iraqi forces. Are they really ready to stand up once you draw down by the end of this month?\n\nODIERNO: Well, this is something that we've been working for a very long time with the Iraqi security forces. For the last 20 months, we've been slowly and deliberately turning over more and more responsibility to them, and they have stepped up. They continue to do broad-scoped operations across all of Iraq. We continue to help them as they do these, and that will continue after 1 September, our assistance. But we do believe they are ready to assume full operations in Iraq.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you about the violence. This weekend alone in Basra in the south, there has been a big explosion that's caused dozens of deaths. What is it? Do you know what it is, in fact, was it a terrorist attack?\n\nODIERNO: Well, I think it probably was. We're still sorting through that, because there was conflicting reports, but my guess is it was probably some sort of an improvised explosive device that went off.\n\nI would just say, this is a reflection -- we have ups and downs here. As I step back, having been here since the dark days of 2006 and '7, to where we are today, what I see is a broad change in the security environment here in Iraq.\n\nHowever, there are still groups out there who are conducting terrorist acts against the people of Iraq, and they are doing this to stop the political way forward, to stop the political process moving forward, to stop democracy moving forward, and to cause the government of Iraq not to continue its progress. And that's what we're seeing that's playing out on the ground now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, General Odierno, in fact, it seems that the political parties in Iraq are not moving forward with the democracy as you describe it. Five months or more after the election, there is still no government. How much does that worry you, and what kind of vacuum is that creating there?\n\nODIERNO: Well, again, first off, we've seen during this time, this governmental formation timeframe, the Iraqi security forces have acted neutral; they've continued to conduct operations across the broad spectrum of operations that are necessary. In fact, I have found them to be very professional in continuing to execute the security profile. So we have seen no degradation in their ability to execute the security profile. And I think that's actually an extremely positive step forward for them, that they've continued to operate, even though -- or during this time of governmental formation.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, how concerned are you and at what point will you be concerned if there is no government, and do you think that that is providing space for insurgents to reorganize, as many suggest?\n\nODIERNO: Well, I will just tell you, is what we -- again, what we can't do is overreact to incidents. There are going to be incidents that occur here. There is a level of violence and a level of terrorism here that's going to occur. But I will tell you, over the last six to seven months, the success that we've had against Al Qaida in Iraq specifically in decapitating the leadership has in fact affected them. The kind of operations that they now conduct are very different than what they did just six months ago or eight months ago. And the kind of their ability to surge and do this over a sustained period of time is limited, and that's due to a lot of the work of the Iraqi security forces, working with us to conduct these operations.\n\nSo I think they can handle it. I think the bottom is for us here now, it's not about the number of people on the ground. It's really about how we continue to sustain stability. And you have to do that through continued development economically, continued development diplomatically and politically, as well as the continued improvement of the security forces. And I think we have a plan to do that beyond 1 September.\n\nAMANPOUR: So let me ask you about the diplomatic engagement, as you say. Do you think that the effort on military drawdown and the engagement that you have had with the Iraqis on the military drawdown may have not been matched by the effort on the diplomatic and political front?\n\nODIERNO: Well, I think, again, they come at different times. I think what we now have is -- it's about -- it's not only about our commitment; it's about the Iraqis now having the capability to move forward. And what we've seen over the last two years, that their governmental entities have improved significantly, and they are starting to move forward economically. For example, they have signed a whole bunch of oil contracts now that are just beginning to be executed across Iraq. So we're starting to see this economic progress.\n\nYou know, the political progress is slow because of the delaying of formation of the government. But I would say that's because we had legitimate, credible elections. The results were very close, and so now it's made it very difficult to form the government. But all the sides are talking. They are working through the formation of the government.\n\nAnd so I think they understand the importance of getting a government formed, so they continue to get assistance from the United States in developing their capacity across the economic and diplomatic spectrum.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think, General, that the government will be formed by September 1, when you are meant to be withdrawing to 50,000 force?\n\nODIERNO: Again, I would say the numbers and our numbers of withdrawing is not linked to the governmental formation process. Do I think they will have made progress by the 1st of September? I think so. I think we'll see some first steps toward forming a government by 1 September, but our numbers are not linked to that formation of the government. Our numbers are linked to the capacity that the Iraqis -- of the Iraqi security forces being able to sustain stability. And I think they are moving toward that capacity.\n\nAnd I remind everybody that we'll have 50,000 troops on the ground post 1 September, and that is still a very significant presence to continue to assist the Iraqi security forces as we move forward.\n\nAMANPOUR: What are you noticing in terms of interference potentially from other funded groups from the neighbors? Do you notice or are you alarmed that there may be any kind of other countries trying to take advantage of what is a bit of a political vacuum right now?\n\nODIERNO: Well, Iraq, as you well know, Christiane, Iraq is a strategically important place in the Middle East, just by its geographic location, by its population, by the influence it's had in the Middle East for a long time. So neighboring countries from around the Middle East have an interest inside of Iraq.\n\nBut I will tell you that I think Iraqis themselves are nationalistic in nature, and that's why it's important. A strong Iraq will defend itself against interference from outside countries, and I think as we build a strong Iraq and as we continue to build a strong security mechanism and as we continue to help them economically and diplomatically, that will make it less likely of others from the outside being able to interfere.\n\nNow, for the vacuum as we see today, again, I remind everyone is that we still have a significant presence here, and we are not going to -- we will not allow undue maligned influence on the Iraqi government as they attempt to form their government. What we're trying to do is provide them the space and time for them to do that, and we will continue to do that post 1 September. We'll still have a significant civilian presence, and again, we'll still have 50,000 troops on the ground here to ensure that this government can be formed by the Iraqis. And that all the other nations respect their sovereignty as they go about forming their government.\n\nAMANPOUR: What gives you the most concern right now? You are obviously speaking with great confidence about the Iraqi forces that you've been able to stand up. I think it's somewhere over 125,000 Iraqi forces since the surge. What gives you the most concern at the moment as you approach that August 31st date?\n\nODIERNO: I think I would just say it's not the security profile. Obviously I believe there will be people who attempt to take advantage of the opportunity of the attention being brought upon the August 31st date. And so, there will be groups who will try to take advantage and show weakness in the government of Iraq and try to create some sort of lack of confidence of the people in the process as you move forward. So that's probably my first concern. But I believe we can overcome that concern.\n\nThe second is, is that the Iraqis have to understand the importance of forming a government, doing it as quickly as possible, and getting themselves ready to leap forward so they can make progress on the economic front and the diplomatic front. And they've got to set themselves up for that, so it's important for the Iraqis to understand the importance of moving forward quickly, and I think we're starting to see that as we see negotiations pick up over the last couple of weeks.\n\nAMANPOUR: OK, and final question -- do you think U.S. diplomats have done enough to push the political parties together?\n\nODIERNO: I think it's a very fine line here, Christiane. What we want is we want to have the Iraqis form their own government. What we try to do here is facilitate that process, and I think that we behind the scenes have tried to facilitate the process without being directive in who should do what. And I think we've done a pretty fair job of that. And I think as time goes on, we'll try to facilitate it a bit harder to get them to move forward a bit quicker.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you very much, General Odierno. Thanks for joining us.\n\nODIERNO: OK, thank you very much. It was good to be with you today.\n\nAMANPOUR: General Chiarelli, thank you very much for joining us on THIS WEEK.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, it's great to be here.\n\nAMANPOUR: One of the most extraordinary lines that I think I took away from the entire report was when it says, simply stated, we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy. That is pretty stark.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, we have an army that's, for almost a decade, has been going very, very hard with our operational tempo; having our soldiers deployed for 12 months, home anywhere from 12 to 16 months, and back for another 12 or 15-month deployment.\n\nAMANPOUR: It's too much.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well -- and during that time, we've seen an increase with some soldiers, a very small number of soldiers, of high-risk behavior.\n\nAMANPOUR: What do you mean by \"high-risk behavior\"?\n\nCHIARELLI: Well the abuse of alcohol, drugs, getting in trouble with the law.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is it just people who are predisposed to high-risk behavior or is it the -- the pressures of, as you said, these multiple deployments on such short turnaround?\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, we definitely think, and we have some pretty good data to show, that deployment plays a role in the increase that we've seen. But at the same time, there's all kind of stressors in a soldier's life.\n\nAMANPOUR: So let's talk about the particular problems. Let's talk about suicide-- so what did you notice about the suicide rate amongst the soldiers and those who are coming back?\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, some of the things that we're seeing in suicides is 60 percent of our suicides take place(AUDIO GAP) with our soldiers who are in their first term of enlistment. Normally, it's six --\n\nAMANPOUR: Sixty percent?\n\nCHIARELLI: Sixty percent.\n\nAMANPOUR: And most of those suicides are happening back home.\n\nCHIARELLI: There are two-thirds that are occurring back home and about a third that are happening in theater.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me put up a statement that comes from the report. It says that there are instances where a leader's lack of soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they have been dead for three or four weeks. And then it goes on to say that in an organization, the military, that prides itself on never leaving a soldier behind, this sobering example speaks to the leadership breakdown, the breakdown of leadership in a Garrison which appears to be worsening as the requirements of prolonged conflict slowly erode the essential attributes that have defined the Army for generations.\n\nThat's very serious language.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well it is, and it needs to be serious cause we need to go back to doing things the way we used to do things.\n\nAMANPOUR: But how does this happen? I mean, why aren't people looking at these young men? You've already mentioned that they are under extraordinary stress because of the redeployments in a much shorter period of time than is much generally called for.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, commanders --\n\nAMANPOUR: So you know that they're at risk.\n\nCHIARELLI: Commanders are getting ready to take their soldiers into harm's way. And let's say you have a soldier that has a minor problem with alcohol, gets stopped at a roadside spot check and blows just over the legal limit six weeks before deployment.\n\nNow, this soldier has been downrange with you, done just a fantastic job in his last deployment and you're faced with either putting him into a drug and alcohol program or turning to the platoon sergeant and saying, listen, PFC. Chiarelli's a good soldier, let's do what we can. Let's forget this time.\n\nAMANPOUR: So no accountability?\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, I'm not saying no accountability --\n\nAMANPOUR: Repeat offenders.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, that's how repeat offenders happen. He comes back from his next deployment, has a more serious issue with alcohol, no one knows about the first cause the leadership has changed out or he's moved to another unit, and we have this problem.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I ask you, because I want to sort of stop you when you say high-risk behavior. Obviously some of it is because of high-risk behavior, but there are parents who have told us that it's not just about high-risk behavior. They're children were absolutely fine until they went to the front over and over again. One mother said, that she's offended at how suicide victims are being stereotyped as reckless losers predisposed to engage high-risk behavior, her son didn't leave home that way.\n\nYou know, do you think that -- do you think that all of these people are simply predisposed to high-risk behavior?\n\nCHIARELLI: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. What are soldiers are seeing downrange every day human beings shouldn't see at times, and we have problems with posttraumatic stress. We know we have soldiers who come back, and I like to call it a chemical injury that takes place because of the way their body reacts to some kind of event.\n\nAMANPOUR: And yet, you know, I know, because I've reported on these soldiers, and you know because you've had to deal with them and take care of them that this still is an enormous stigma\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me put up something that President Obama said this week about this very issue. Listen.\n\n(BEGIN CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: To anyone who is struggling, don't suffer in silence. It's not a sign of weakness to reach out for support, it's a sign of strength. Your country needs you. We are here for you. We are here to help you stand tall. Don't give up.\n\n(END CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So President Obama speaking to veterans earlier this week.\n\nBut the thing is, whose here? How many behavioral experts do you have? How many people do you need? How many do you actually have?\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, I don't know if we know how many we need. We have a force that has been stressed after almost a decade of war. We're looking for new ways to be able to deliver behavior health, such as virtual behavior health where we literally bring up a network using the internet, using the network of doctors, say 200, from all over the United States who can, in fact, provide a good, good look at our soldiers when they return.\n\nAMANPOUR: I've heard that perhaps you have a shortfall of hundreds of people who can actually provide this kind of help.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, we do have a shortage.\n\nAnd if you want to get at stigma, you start with the brigade commander, brigade command sergeant major and work right down the chain of command so every soldier sees his leader going through the same checks that the soldier's going to go through.\n\nAMANPOUR: I want to also have you listen to a young soldier in -- on the battlefield. Listen to this little clip for a moment.\n\n(BEGIN CLIP)\n\nMALE: You can't get a better high. It's like crack, you know? You can skydive or bungee jump or do kayak, what? Once you've been shot at, you really can't come down. There's nothing -- you can't top that.\n\nQUESTION: Are you going to go back to the civilian world then?\n\nMALE: I have no idea.\n\n(END CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: There it is.\n\nCHIARELLI: Well, that's the kind of individual -- that individual needs that help that we've got to convince to get that help. And we've got to get leadership to be attuned to those kind of reactions.\n\nAMANPOUR: What can leadership say to young soldiers, young servicemen and women who find themselves at the front and who have that reaction that there's no bigger high, that we cannot cope with civilian life once we come back?\n\nCHIARELLI: Leaders need to lead, to know their soldiers, to look for those signs that they see that PFC. Chiarelli has changed. PFC. Chiarelli is going out and maybe drinking a little bit too much, showing up for work late, whatever it might be.\n\nAMANPOUR: And just so that it's clear, it's not just suicides we're talking about, we're talking about crime, we're talking about rape, we're talking about addiction and dependence.\n\nAnd for instance, one of the statements in the report, as we continue to wage war on several fronts, data would suggest we're becoming more dependent on pharmaceuticals to sustain the force. In fact, anecdotal information suggests that the force is becoming increasingly dependent on both legal and illegal drugs.\n\nI mean, that's terrifying.\n\nCHIARELLI: That's a concern. We know that we had over 106,00 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant, anti-anxiety medicine.\n\nAMANPOUR: Because I mean it sort of raises the specter of a significant number of people out there heavily armed, afraid, under fire, IEDs and drugs are sort of the motivating --\n\nCHIARELLI: But but, we know that the drugs that we're talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when they're downrange. So we're not sending any soldier into harm's way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others.\n\nAMANPOUR: So now the big picture. Obviously, you've got this human drama. You mentioned already that they're being redeployed at much shorter intervals than many suggest are the correct intervals. For instance, some are saying that for a year in combat you have to have three years in Garrison, at home base. Are you able to do that?\n\nCHIARELLI: That's our goal.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you able to?\n\nCHIARELLI: No, we're not there yet, but we're going to see ourselves get further, what we call, into balance. The first step for us is getting one year deployed, 24 months at home. That's our first step. We would like to get to one to three, which would be either nine months deployed, 27 months back home or 12 months deployed, 36 months back home.We know when that happens many of the problems that we've seen will in fact meliorate themselves.\n\nAMANPOUR: And how do you make sure you maintain your combat edge, as a military, as a force, and still have these appropriate cares for these people who are obviously coming back stressed and very fragile?\n\nCHIARELLI: You need that time at home. A portion of those 106,000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication, it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue.\n\nThere are soldiers who have been on two, three, four deployments, hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8,000 feet and they've got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful. Probably should stay home and get operated on, but they go back for the second deployment and they're on some kind of a pain medication. We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when they're hurt.\n\nAMANPOUR: For their country.\n\nCHIARELLI: That's exactly right. Who feel a tremendous need that we all do in the military -- to be with our buddies. That's what it's all about.\n\nAnd that's one of the issues that we have to get through is we try to break down stigma. To get soldiers to understand that these hidden wounds of war are things that they've got to seek help for when they have problems.\n\nAMANPOUR: General Peter Chiarelli, thank you very much indeed for joining us.\n\nCHIARELLI: Thank you.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Birthright citizenship I think is a mistake.\n\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: This is the kind of thing that irritates Americans quite a lot.\n\nSEN. ARLEN SPECTER, D-PA.: Political pandering on the immigration issue has reached an hysterical (ph) level.\n\nSEN. JEFF SESSIONS, R-ALA.: I don't think the founders understood when (inaudible) the 14th Amendment that it would create a circumstance that people would fly into America from all over the world and have a child.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: The debate over the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to those born in America. One of the topics we'll discuss this morning on our roundtable with Gillian Tett of the Financial Times; Michael Gerson, former Bush speechwriter and Washington Post columnist; George Packer of the New Yorker and John Harris of Politico. George Will is on vacation.\n\nAnd before turning to domestic news, I want to start with Iraq, because we just heard from General Odierno and we know that the drawdown -- President Obama made his speech today reaffirming the drawdown -- rather, this week.\n\nDo you think everybody is taking credit but not giving credit where credit is due?\n\nGERSON: I didn't find the speech a particularly generous search. I mean, this is really the implementation of the status of forces agreement that was agreed to in 2008, under the Bush administration. Barack Obama, people forget, actually voted against funding for the troops. He opposed the surge. He gave a speech without mentioning the surge or General Petraeus. I think that that's probably -- you know, he's attempting to take credit for something that he opposed.\n\nAMANPOUR: The surge, let's face it, has worked up until now. We can see that it's had a huge, huge impact on stability in Iraq, despite a spike in violence. Do you think that it would have been even politically expedient to actually praise the surge? Because the future of Iraq is this president's future.\n\nHARRIS: Well, probably, the more cynical thing to do or the more sort of Machiavellian thing to do for President Obama would have been to lavish credit on President Bush. One of the central parts of Obama's brand, at least when he came into Washington, was that he was a bridge builder and could sort of drain (ph) politics. And he would have therefore sort of cut off the conservative critique, which is out there, that he is leaving too soon, and look gracious in doing so. I don't know, I think that may have just been -- that does not come naturally to him and it might have been a little much to swallow.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me put up this byte, this little bit of sound from Vice President Biden on this issue.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.: I'm very optimistic about Iraq. I think it's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPACKER: Yes, it's a bit much. I mean, no one was for the surge. The surge had the support of a tiny group of people in Washington. Basically, the White House and its close allies, and the people in the military. And it stabilized Iraq, along with political developments inside that country. Let's not forget that there was the Sunni awakening. There was Muqtada Al-Sadr's decision to stand down his Shiite militias. So all of those things, the surge took advantage of. It has stabilized. But let's not exaggerate what kind of Iraq we're going to be leaving as we leave in the next year and a half. I mean, we spent $10 billion on that country's electrical system. How many hours a day are there of electricity in Baghdad now? Five hours a day. It's better than it was three years ago; it's still a pretty intolerable level of daily life and violence for ordinary Iraqis.\n\nTETT: And let's not underestimate the costs to the American people. I mean, we are seeing not just the financial costs. It's a human cost too, and I imagine that questions about that actually (ph) are going to keep mounting as we go forward not just in Iraq but Afghanistan as well.\n\nAMANPOUR: Michael?\n\nGERSON: And the next stage is complicated. I mean, we are -- our combat troops are leaving, but the political process is a difficult one, as you discussed earlier. The United States approach has been pretty hands-off. But if a government doesn't form after Ramadan, I think there is going to be a big argument over whether the United States is going to need to use a lot more leverage in this circumstance to try to get a good outcome and not convey that we're cutting and running, that we are no longer interested in Iraq. I think that would be a real mistake.\n\nAMANPOUR: And as we turn to the economy, which is obviously a huge, huge issue for the American people and, of course, people around the world, let's just put up this statistic that has come out this week, that there was a loss of 131,000 jobs, although private-sector jobs rose by 71,000. That's according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate remains pretty much the same at 9.5 percent, and there are 14.6 million Americans looking for work.\n\nWhat to say beyond throwing up one's hands? What can be done?\n\nTETT: Well, they're shocking numbers. And I think it's important to realize that what it illustrates is that the president, right now, is at a pretty important juncture point. For the last year, we have had some growth in the American economy, but much of that has been due to government aid, government spending, or what economists call an inventory rebuild. Basically, companies and shops ran down the stocks back in late 2008. They rebuilt them, but that process is kind of finished. And the big question now is, can the economy keep growing if the government doesn't keep pumping in money?\n\nAMANPOUR: The secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, went out earlier this week to talk a lot about the economy and pumping it up. There was an op-ed that he actually penned for the New York Times, and I believe the title was \"Welcome to the Recovery.\" Is that something that he would have liked to have seen as an op-ed title?\n\nHARRIS: Well, the Treasury secretary was put in the same position as a newspaper reporter everywhere when we have to protest, hey, I don't write the headline. He definitely did not write the headline. The people in the Treasury actually saw that as almost -- almost a malicious move. They say it as a sarcastic or even taunting headline.\n\nThe substance of his op-ed in the New York Times was nuanced, saying, look, a lot of people are hurting, but the economy is getting better. And they were very purposeful in wanting to do that. The administration does feel that there is an important psychic element to recovery. They recognize that people do not have confidence. They recognize that many in the business sector believe that Obama is hostile to them, and they are tying to change that perception.\n\nPACKER: Seems like there is a widespread view that we're just entering a period in which growth is very slow and unemployment is very high. And there is not a lot that the private sector is going to be able to do about it, so the real question is, public policy. And there's a big debate in Congress and I think in this upcoming election as to the role of government.\n\nRight now, it seems like a lot of Democrats have joined Republicans in saying, we've done what we can with government spending, and yet there are millions of unemployed people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGERSON: Democrats are pretty much at an ideological dead end. The reality is that this week, when Biden addressed these issues, he said the stimulus should have been larger. Pelosi is calling back the Congress to spend more money on public employees. The answer, they have really -- the Democrats in America have one answer, which is more spending, but that's precisely what independents are so concerned about in this upcoming election. Deficits, debt and spending.\n\nSo their economic answer is very much at odds with their political, you know, future here.\n\nTETT: But the problem in a way is that, you know, in a sense also the social contract in America, the American dream is starting to fragment. Because for years, America's prided itself on having an unemployment rate that was a lot lower than Europe's, but it didn't have a social safety net like Europe. Now in a sense it doesn't have a social safety net, and yet shockingly, the unemployment rate is approaching European levels, in some cases actually exceeding it, and that's a real challenge not just in an economic sense, but in a political sense too, about what is the American dream?\n\nAMANPOUR: And what about ingenuity in an economy? In other words, coming up with new ways to sort of spur the economy. Obviously, America and we've all been reading about how it has been losing its competitive edge in manufacturing. What is -- where are the new ideas in generating a new kind of economy that will generate jobs?\n\nPACKER: Well, the stimulus bill was supposed to fund a million new projects in terms of new energy, transportation, et cetera. Maybe we're not seeing the results right now. Maybe we have all become so used to instant analysis and instant results that we are just disappointed prematurely, and we'll see that in a few years, that spending is going to be having an effect in a lot of different parts of the country. But right now, there's just a sense of stagnation, which is truly lethal to the party in power.\n\nTETT: And what's fascinating is that so much of America in the last few decades has been about trying to focus on growing the pie, not worrying about how it is divided up. Because if you keep growing the pie, through innovation, through private-sector enterprise, then you don't have to worry about social equity and things like that. But if we are entering a period when the pie is stagnant, the question is going to be very political (ph), how do you divide that pie up?\n\nAMANPOUR: And political, what is this going to do for these upcoming elections?\n\nHARRIS: I think the larger sort of anemic state of the economy almost makes the traditional things that political reporters obsess about -- what is the message, what is the campaign strategy, where are they going to put the resources, almost makes them all irrelevant. An unemployment rate nearly 10 percent is the dominant fact. And the fact that there don't seem to be good policy remedies out there, and the Obama administration does indeed seem at somewhat loose ends as to what its next step is, that just makes it a very, very tough climate, and really makes all the other kind of tactical questions almost irrelevant.\n\nTETT: And poisonous as well. I mean, you really are starting to see the beginnings of a sort of a culture of hate, of finger-pointing, of scape-goating, and that could fuel the way for some very nasty, very negative politics going forward.\n\nAMANPOUR: And is it going to, you know, obviously the Obama administration wants to use the word choice coming up to this election, there is a choice between what we're doing and what the previous administration did. How is that going to play out? Because obviously a lot of the structural issues right now started in the previous administration?\n\nGERSON: I think some of that is true. But the reality is that the decisions that are made by current job creators about whether to invest in plants and equipment are decisions that are made about current events, not about two years ago. And right now, entrepreneurs see endless deficits and likely much higher taxes. A pretty hostile environment for investment in America. That is going to have to be turned around. You can't create jobs at a level we need in this economy without about a 4 percent growth rate, which is twice what we have now. And you know, politicians are going to have to step forward and say, how are we going to get growth?\n\nPACKER: I would add that it's been a somewhat one-sided ideological argument. The Republican Party has been united, vociferous and simple and clear in its message about what they don't want. And yet the Obama administration has been I think almost reluctant to say what they do want and what principles underlie it. They don't like to argue philosophically, unlike, say, Reagan, whom Obama has said good things about in the past. And that's left them exposed to the ideological arguments of the other side without being able to tell the country, here are the principles and the values and the reasons why the stimulus bill, the health care bill, the financial reform bill were all essential to correcting the failed philosophy of the last administration. They don't like to talk that way. And I'd say it's left them exposed in the fall elections.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's move on to another issue, which was and has been a big issue this week, and that's the debate over 14th Amendment. We just saw clips from various political leaders talking about potentially having hearings on changing the Constitution.\n\nMichael, you have written about this, and I think you were very shocked that this is coming out of the Republicans right now.\n\nGERSON: Not just the Republicans, but you have Lindsey Graham, who has really been the voice of humanity (ph) and reform in immigration reform, and John McCain, who has changed his views in a very tough primary in this case. So the biggest defenders of the essentially pro-immigrant message in the Republican Party are turning for political reasons. That shows how powerful it is within the party, which I think it's bad in the long term for the Republican Party.\n\nOn this issue in particular, it's terrible policy. I mean, I think few constitutional scholars will disagree with that, but it's terrible politics for the Republican Party. Not in this election, but really decades down the road, appealing to the, you know, largest growing group of voters in America.\n\nAMANPOUR: And just so that we're clear, just describe for us exactly what the 14th Amendment was. It was to protect the children of African-American slaves who were born here.\n\nPACKER: It made them citizens. It gave them equal rights and due process under the Constitution. It's foundational. I mean, you could argue that along with the free expression amendments of the Bill of Rights, it's the most important constitutional amendment there is, and for the constitutionalist party, a party who has really become captive to a movement that wants to go back to a minimal reading of the Constitution and for government to do very little else, it's very strange that they should be tinkering with a sacred constitutional amendment.\n\nHARRIS: Also, Christiane, I would say it undercuts Republicans' own message. They said look, Arizona needed to act, right now, because there's a tangible problem right now and the federal government wasn't acting. Talking about the 14th Amendment is not serious politics. I mean, it would take years for a constitutional amendment to get passed. I mean, it's truly 100 percent symbolic politics.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTETT: ... quick fix sound byte politics and this culture of hate, and this, you know, scape-goating that's going on right now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let's show some pictures. Actually, I wanted to ask you because there's a European connection to all of this as well. There has been protests in France, and President Sarkozy, who likes to call himself Sarko the American, has come out with some rather terrifying ideas about sending back foreign-born citizens if they're convicted of any crimes, about putting all sorts of anti-Muslim cultural crimes that he would use as a basis for sending them back.\n\nTETT: You only have to go back to the era of the great crash, the Great Depression, to see what happens when you have a period of profound ...economic dislocation and pain, and people start putting up barriers and pointing the fingers. And there's a risk that is now the era we're entering.\n\nGERSON: And that is the wisdom of the authors of the 14th Amendment. They essentially wanted to take this very, very difficult issue -- citizenship -- outside the political realm. They wanted to have an objective standard, birth, instead of a subjective standard, which is the majorities at the time. I think it's a much better way to deal with an issue like this.\n\nHARRIS: In fairness, one argument you could make, Michael, is that immigration reform is never going to happen unless this issue is really at a boil, and so perhaps that's what Lindsey Graham is doing. OK, let's turn this up to a boil and--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGERSON: -- cynical approach, to essentially take an issue this sensitive and this symbolic, and use that as way to leverage other political reform. I think that would be really cynical.\n\nPACKER: And I think a question -- something I'm looking for is how many Republicans and conservatives like Michael are going to stand up on this. Because what we've seen over the last year and a half on issue after issue is the more extreme tendencies in the Republican Party have been the loudest and have dominated the party's public posture. And few Republican leaders have been willing to distinguish themselves from it, because they pay a price.\n\nAMANPOUR: You've just written an article in the New Yorker this week about what you call the broken Senate. What exactly do you mean? We've got a quote from the article and then I want you to explain what you basically found there. That the Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and secret holds -- when a senator anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent.\"\n\nPACKER: Historically, the Senate has been the slower-moving of the two houses. The famous and maybe apocryphal story is that Jefferson asked Washington, why do we need a Senate? And Washington said, why did you pour your coffee from the cup into the saucer? And Jefferson said, to cool it. And Washington said, that's why we need the Senate, to cool the hotter, more impulsive passions of the people's chamber.\n\nBut right now, the Senate is -- it's gelatinous, it's stagnant. It -- I spent weeks sitting in the press gallery and wandering the halls and talking to senators. I sort of approached it as a newcomer. What goes on here? What are the customs, what are the rules? How do people treat each other? How much time do they spend having lunch together? How much time do they spend fund-raising? What I learned was, everything happens there except deliberation. And this is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body.\n\nAMANPOUR: And yet, quite a lot of legislation, quite a lot of big bills and laws have gone through.\n\nGERSON: I think you can argue with something like the health care reform that the Senate did exactly what it was supposed to do. It passed the bill, but it moderated it in some key ways, that I think took care of some of the worst excesses. That's what the Senate is supposed to do. And I think that some of these other issues like cap-and-trade and immigration, the reason they're not passing is not because the Senate is dysfunctional. It's because we don't have a national consensus on those issues.\n\nPACKER: Those are the big, big bills that get public attention, but daily life in the Senate, even on health care for example -- there was one moment in December when it was coming up for a vote, and in order to delay it as close as possible to Christmas, just to be a pain, the Republicans decided to filibuster a military spending bill -- imagine, during two wars, military spending was going to be held up in the Senate. And one Republican in particular, Thad Cochran, who didn't want to filibuster it because he wanted the money to go out, finally had to cave in because his leadership told him, we need your vote for the filibuster. That's daily life in the Senate, where senators aren't even really thinking and acting on their own.\n\nAMANPOUR: You quoted a lot of senators as sort of bemoaning glorious yesteryear where everybody was congenial and collegial and eating and drinking and basically doing deals together. This is what Senator Mitch McConnell said in response to your article.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMCCONNELL: I don't see the same, David, Senate, that this New Yorker author sees. Some of my best friends are Democrats. Chris Dodd, Harry Reid. I don't think we have a collegiality problem. What we are in the middle of is a great debate about the future of the country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Last word to all of you.\n\nHARRIS: He said \"that New Yorker author\" as though he was taking out the trash.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARRIS: I mean, it was a great portrait of how sullen, snarling the Senate is.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is it about a huge debate over the future of the country?\n\nGERSON: I think we're having a major debate about the role and size of government, and the Senate is going to reflect that.\n\nTETT: And it's not just about the future of the country. It's about whether the government that has the machinery in place to actually solve the most pressing problems, be that unemployment or Iraq.\n\nPACKER: Like Wall Street, our political institutions are decadent and it's because of failure of elites to restrain themselves and behave in a larger interest.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we'll continue this discussion and the roundtable in the green room on abcnews.com\/this week, where you can also find our fact checks in conjunction with PolitiFact.",

    "text":"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\n\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"\n\nThe report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"\n\nThe National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.\n\nMexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.\n\nDrugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.\n\nSmugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn\u2019t been studying drug facts for nothing.\n\nWe rate this claim True.",

    "text":"Dear Patriot,\n\nGreetings to our constituents, fellow Floridians, and indeed all Americans, it is time to prepare our weekly update for dissemination.\n\nToday is the 71st Anniversary of the attack on US Naval Base, Pearl Harbor which truly marked our entry into World War II. I can still remember my dad sharing with me his feeling when he heard about this attack on the radio. Of course, he would go forth and serve in the US Army during World War II in the European Theater of Operations (ETO).\n\nLittle did my dad realize at the time, that he was beginning a legacy of service to our nation that has now spanned four generations. My dad was a member of that \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d and today his grandson, my nephew, carries that honor to this day.\n\nAs with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, America has, and always will, produce the caliber of men and women who stand as guardians for our nation\u2019s honor. These are men and women who have answered the call then and continue to do so now.\n\nTomorrow many in our nation will watch the next generation of these men and women as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Football Game\u201d takes place, Army vs. Navy. I wonder how many of these young men and women have relatives who were at Pearl Harbor, or served in World War II?\n\nI am proud to know that my own godson, Midshipman John Melvin Hendricks (that rascal who joined the Navy) will be taking that field tomorrow, his second year.\n\nSo as we remember Pearl Harbor today, let us never forget those who will stand and answer the call to arms to protect this Republic, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.\n\nAnd in speaking of those who serve, I was angered by the developments this week surrounding Army Major Nidal Hasan who three years ago shot 43 soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians, killing 13. An Army appellate court decision removed the current assigned judge from the case citing that he was not impartial. Furthermore, the court backed the assertion that Major Hasan did not have to be forced to shave his beard.\n\nIt just appears again that we are placating and playing the game of political correctness. It is horrific enough that we have classified this terrorist attack as \u201cwork place violence\u201d but consider the continued disappointment of those who lost loved ones on that day\u2026 for them, it will always be a day which shall live in infamy.\n\nThis week we voted in the House of Representatives to remove the word \u201clunatic\u201d from federal law. However, that does not mean there isn't plenty of lunacy going on in the workings of the federal government!\n\nFurther, I find it interesting when media pundits and talking heads ask the disturbing question, \u201cWhat will America do if Bashar al-Asad uses chemical weapons in his people?\u201d I would have hoped it would never get to the point of his feeling empowered to use those weapons. It just seems we continue to take a defensive posture reacting to events.\n\nIf we had done as military generals on the ground had suggested in Iraq and retained a viable and credible military presence in the region, we could have precluded this. Instead we now have Iran transiting across Iraq to support Asad\u2026 and continuing to support terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad.\n\nThe Obama Administration was in such a rush to demand former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down. Why not the same vigor when it comes to Mohammed Morsi?\n\nI also recall the Obama Administration supporting a Marxist\/Socialist President in Honduras and not supporting the movement in Iran against Mahmoud Ahmandinejad.\n\nConfusing? Just imagine what our allies are thinking.\n\nAnd what happened in Benghazi? America must never stop asking that question, regardless of what the mainstream media wants to hide. Losing an Ambassador, a Foreign Service officer, and two former US Navy SEALS must never EVER become the new normal.\n\nToday, we received the monthly jobs report for November, with 7.7% unemployment and 146,000 jobs created. On the surface it is good news. However, one step beyond the superficial, we realize this is still an economy limping along.\n\nFirst, the previous job creation numbers from the months of September and October were revised downward by 50,000 respectively. Second, the unemployment rate dropped due to another 350,000 Americans dropping out of the labor force. This means we still have a labor force participation rate hovering at 63.6%, which has and continues to be a record low. At this rate, we could theoretically achieve an unemployment rate of zero if everyone just quit working altogether.\n\nFinally, our U6 computation rate remains dangerously high, due not only to 12 million unemployed Americans, but also a little over 8 million underemployed Americans.\n\nCombined with a fragile economy where the US Federal Reserve is printing money in order to cover a monthly $40 billion mortgage debt, America is hardly out of the woods.\n\nThese simple facts just reinforce the need to have sound fiscal, tax, and regulatory policy -- not politics -- that will incentivize economic growth and wealth expansion. The last thing the private sector and job creators need worry about is more confiscatory economics masquerading as viable solutions to a serious fiscal problem.\n\nWashington DC spends too much, and sending this Administration more American taxpayer dollars is not the answer. It is mathematically impossible to tax \u201cthe rich\u201d enough to make a dent in our debt. We must be talking about where to reduce spending first. And why is it that only taxpayers, not the federal government, are expected to \u201cshare the burden?\u201d\n\nThis is my final weekly update from our Congressional office, but it is by no means my final weekly update... When one door closes, another opens and we shall continue to advocate for truth, the restoration of this Republic, and promote Constitutional conservative principles in the New Year.\n\nIt has been my honor to serve as the Representative of the People of Florida\u2019s 22nd Congressional District. The fight for our Constitutional Republic has truly begun and I will be on the frontline.\n\nMay everyone have a wonderful holiday season and may God bless the United States of America.\n\nSteadfast and Loyal,\n\nLegislative Update:\n\n-This Week\n\nCoast Guard Authorization\u2014On Wednesday, the United States House of Representatives passed legislation to authorize appropriations for the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) through Fiscal Year 2014 and for the Maritime Administration through fiscal year 2013. H.Res.825, Providing for the concurrence by the House of Representatives in the United States Senate amendments to H.R. 2838, with an amendment, passed by voice. The amended Coast Guard authorization would authorize$17.34 billion for Coast Guard operations and $296 million for the national security aspects of the Maritime Administration. H.R. 2838, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2011, originally passed the House of Representatives in November, 2011. That bill passed the United States Senate with an amendment in September, 2012.\n\n- Next Week\n\nThe United States House of Representatives will meet next week on Tuesday, December 11, for legislative business. The House will consider a number of bills under a suspension of the rules throughout the week. Last votes for the week are now expected on Thursday, December 13 (this is a change from the announced calendar).

    "text":"November 14, 2010 \u2014 -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Welcome to our viewers here and around the world. I'm Christiane Amanpour. And at the top of the news this week, the Gang of 20. At the big summit in Seoul, U.S. economic policies come under fire from China and Germany. Are America's woes putting its global leadership in question?\n\nOBAMA: A whole host of other countries are doing very well. Naturally, they are going to be more assertive.\n\nAMANPOUR: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham debate America's role in the world.\n\nThen, American austerity.\n\nBOWLES: The path we're on today is not sustainable. We are headed for disaster.\n\nAMANPOUR: Two members of the president's deficit commission, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and Honeywell International Chairman and CEO David Cote share some sobering views on tough economic choices the United States faces.\n\nAnd the coming showdown over tax cuts.\n\nBOEHNER: Making these permanent will be the most important thing we could do to help create jobs in the country.\n\nAMANPOUR: That and all the week's politics on our roundtable with George Will, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.\n\nAnd the Sunday funnies.\n\nFALLON: China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, \"That hasn't happened already?\"\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: And hello again.\n\nBy the time Air Force One lands in Washington this evening, it will have flown around the world, a world that is fast changing, as the president found out during his 10-day trip to Asia. ABC's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper has been with the president and brings us this report.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTAPPER (voice-over): Rebuked by American voters and reminded to focus more on the economy, President Obama began his Asian trip talking it up as a sort of international stimulus to open markets to American goods and bolster American jobs.\n\nOBAMA: We're actually doing some business while we're here. With every $1 billion we sell in exports, 5,000 jobs are supported at home. For America, this is a job strategy.\n\nTAPPER: In Mumbai, India, flanked by American CEOs, the president announced deals between U.S. and Indian companies totaling nearly $10 billion in U.S. exports and maintaining more than 50,000 American jobs.\n\nA cause for celebration, as he and the first lady joined in on the festivities marking the Hindu holiday of Diwali.\n\n(on-screen): By the end of the week here in South Korea, there was no cause for dancing. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies refused President Obama's entreaties to alter their economic policies, policies the president needs changed to fully implement his export strategy, his job strategy.\n\nOBAMA: Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.\n\nTAPPER (voice-over): And sometimes he struck out, failing to convince South Korea to open their markets to American beef and cars. At stake: $10 billion in exports and 70,000 American jobs.\n\nFailing to convince Chinese President Hu Jintao to stop artificially building up the dollar and holding down Chinese currency.\n\nAnd failing to convince his fellow G-20 leaders to use stronger language in the joint declaration on China's currency manipulation.\n\nOBAMA: That is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world.\n\nTAPPER: The president was even forced to push back on attacks that the U.S. was engaging in its own currency manipulation, defending a move by the independent Federal Reserve to inject $600 billion into the U.S. economy.\n\nOBAMA: From everything I can see, this decision was not one designed to have an impact on the currency, on the dollar. It was designed to grow the economy.\n\nTAPPER: Criticisms from G-20 leaders who questioned President Obama's spending habits were made all the more relevant when the co-chairs of the president's own debt commission put forth controversial proposals to reduce the deficit.\n\nBOWLES: This debt is like a cancer that will truly destroy this country from within.\n\nTAPPER: Ones attacked by liberals and conservative, showing how difficult reducing the deficit will be. Modesty was forced upon the president in this trip full of complications.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Jake Tapper, ABC News, traveling with the president.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And to discuss all of this, we're joined now by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He's just come back from a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThank you both for joining us. And let me ask you first, Secretary Albright, because you have been to many of these summits, isn't it extraordinary that the president, that U.S. leadership is being questioned so openly, not just by China, but by Germany, who called the Fed's action, for instance, \"clueless\"?\n\nALBRIGHT: Actually not. I mean, I think -- I've been to lots of meetings, and they are discussions. And I think the thing that people have to remember is that the G-20 was not set up to solve the world's economic problems. It was, it fact, set up as a way to bring the developing countries in to show what the various disagreements can be and to come to various consensus agreements.\n\nAnd it takes a while. I think as the president said, it's an incremental thing.\n\nAnd I don't know. Christiane, I was asked by the Obama administration during the transition to meet with the G-20 when they were here, and I met with everybody individually, and you could see the fact that they all have their own interests. And it is a matter of listening to the various ideas. I think that it is a process, and I think it's very clear that America continues to be central to the process.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Graham. Certainly China and Germany, as you heard, did question America's global leadership. Do you think that is, if not actually, at least symbolically and psychologically damaging for the United States?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I don't want to overreact here. The currency issue was disappointing to me. Clearly, China does manipulate the value of the yuan to get an advantage in exports. They already have enough advantages. I was disappointed with the other nations who would not get behind President Obama to push the Chinese to change their currency policy.\n\nBut, yeah, you know, at the end of the day, we're getting criticism. Does that mean we're losing influence? Not necessarily so.\n\nBut on the currency front and trade front, this was a disappointing meetings. We need a trade agreement with Korea. We need to fight back against China currency manipulation. And I think you're going to see the Congress get more involved on the currency front after this trip.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, certainly the U.S. also being accused of trying to push down and weaken its own currency. You know, you say that this is perhaps just a sort of temporary statement by these countries, but doesn't -- doesn't America have to get its economic house in order, in order to be able to lead on a whole number of other issues, Senator?\n\nGRAHAM: Yes, I think Secretary Clinton -- I think Secretary Clinton got it right that our looming deficit is a national security problem for us, and the only way you can get America's financial house in order is do a bipartisan agreement on entitlement reform.\n\nEarmark's important. That's just on the margins. But if you really want to get America back in business, we've got to come to grips with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and find bipartisan agreements to reform entitlements before it's too late.\n\nWe're an aging population. A lot of baby boomers are going to retire. We've got fewer workers, and we need to do that sooner rather than later.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, we're going to discuss this later on, but do you think there will be compromise?\n\nGRAHAM: There must be. Look what happened with health care when you tried to jam it through on a party-line vote. We need to get Social Security stabilized before it goes into permanent bankruptcy. We're going to have to increase the age. We're going to have to manipulate benefits for upper-income Americans. We've got to put everything on the table, including stable revenues. And I'd like to see this commission help lead the Congress to get some results that have been kicked down the road for far too long.\n\nAMANPOUR: OK. Let me bring up now some of the key foreign policy issues that go to the heart of American prestige and for the president's prestige, the START Treaty, the New START Treaty. Do you think that it will be ratified coming in this lame-duck session?\n\nALBRIGHT: I think it's very important that it be ratified. The president has said it's a priority issue during the lame-duck session. He just finished a meeting with President Medvedev when they were in Japan, and the president restated that it was a priority issue.\n\nAnd the reason it is, is that it's -- first of all, it's a good treaty. But part of the problem is we remember President Reagan said trust, but verify. And what has happened is that the verification procedures have now not been in place for almost a year, so we need that treaty for that.\n\nPlus, I think that we really do -- the relationship with the Russians is very important. They've been very helpful on Iran. And I think -- I hope very, very much that the lame-duck session recognizes the importance of the treaty.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Senator Graham, Senator Kerry has already said that he believes it can happen in December. President Obama said it must happen in the lame-duck session. Do you believe that it will be voted on and ratified in the lame-duck session?\n\nGRAHAM: I don't know. I'm very open-minded about the treaty. As Secretary Albright indicated, it's an important relationship between the United States and Russia. I think Russia could do more, but they have been more helpful.\n\nYou've got two impediments. Modernization. Not only do we need a START Treaty; we need to modernize our nuclear force, the weapons that are left, to make sure they continue to be a deterrent. And we need to make sure that we can employ -- deploy missile defense systems that are apart from START.\n\nSo you've got two stumbling blocks, the modernization program and how missile defense works apart from the treaty.\n\nAMANPOUR: Will you vote for it?\n\nGRAHAM: Jon Kyl is -- in its current condition, no, but Jon Kyl is working with the administration to get better modernization to make sure that missile defense is not connected to START. If you could get those two things together, I would vote for the treaty.\n\nI'd rather have a treaty than not have a treaty, but modernization and missile defense have to be better dealt with before we get there.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you about some news today. You've just come back from Afghanistan and Iraq with a congressional delegation. And there's a story in the Washington Post about how President Karzai seems to be at odds fundamentally with U.S. policy there. Did that come up at all in your conversations with him?\n\nGRAHAM: You know, Christiane, I'm just stunned. We had a great meeting. We had dinner with Senator McCain, Lieberman, myself, Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry with President Karzai. The focus of the article is the night raids.\n\nWe were briefed by our military commanders that the night raids are -- we own the night (ph) militarily, are making huge impact on the Taliban, the insurgency as a whole, and we're having Afghan partners. This didn't come up at all.\n\nWe talked about, quite frankly, looking long term with Afghanistan about having two air bases in a permanent fashion in Afghanistan to provide stability, so at the end of the day, there was no discussion about a difference between Petraeus and Karzai, in terms of strategy.\n\nAnd I would just add this: If we cannot use night raids with our Afghan partners, then that's a big loss in terms of gaining security.\n\nThe Petraeus plan, the Petraeus strategy must be allowed to go forward for us to be successful. The security gains are -- are obvious. We're not there yet, but we're moving in the right direction, and to take the night raids off the table would be a disaster.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you quickly and briefly on this issue of Afghanistan, also. Was President Karzai -- or, rather, do you believe that the U.S. troops will stay in significant numbers post the summer 2011 deadline?\n\nGRAHAM: Yes, I do. I think in summer of 2011, we can bring some troops home, but we're going to need a substantial number of troops in Afghanistan past that.\n\n2014 is the right date to talk about. That's when Karzai suggests that Afghans will be in the lead, and I'm very pleased to hear President Obama talk about 2014.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is winning, having the ability to stabilize Afghanistan and be a good partner with the United States forever. That means we're going to need military force for quite a while. Post-2014, when the Afghans hopefully get in the lead, it will be great to have a couple of air bases there in perpetuity to help the Afghans to send the right signal to the regions, but none of this is possible unless you have a reliable partner in the Afghan government, so they need to do more quickly on corruption.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think, Secretary Albright, that the president is going to move beyond this deadline? I know it's always condition-based, but the acceptance now is it is going to be significant troops for much longer than next summer.\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, they are definitely doing a review, as we -- they've begun it as we speak, and they are going to do a review again, a larger one in December.\n\nI think that the president has said that we're not just going to abandon, that we're in a transition strategy, not an exit strategy, and that it's going to be very important for there to be training of the Afghan police forces and the military forces.\n\nAnd part of the issue, in reading what President Karzai said, is that he keeps saying he wants to take over, but part of the business here is they have to be trained properly and the NATO -- there's going to be a NATO summit, and one of the things they're going to be talking about is how to do this transition policy. And President Obama and Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have said that this is going to be conditions-based.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you a broader question, Secretary Albright, on American engagement. Now that you've got the Republicans in control of Congress, you've got the Tea Party influence, do you think America will keep engaging and keep its leadership roles in so many of these areas? Or will there be a period of turning inwards, whether it's protectionism or in any other foreign policy?\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, I certainly hope not. And President Obama spoke about the problem of protectionism and the fact that we do have to be engaged internationally.\n\nEvery single problem that we are looking at -- whether it's fighting terrorism or dealing with a broken nuclear nonproliferation system or the climate change and energy issues or the gap between the rich and the poor -- requires American leadership, but it also requires being engaged in partners.\n\nAnd so I hope very much -- we don't know what the Tea Party's foreign policy is. And I think that Senator Graham has stated very clearly what the role of the Republicans is in looking at it.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think -- because you've been quoted, Senator Graham, just recently -- that there are two wings now of the Republican Party when it comes to foreign policy, that you will look inwards or outwards. And I also want to ask you about your trip to Iraq.\n\nGRAHAM: Well, let me tell you, I think -- I'm in the wing that wants to look outward and have effective engagements throughout the world, so that's why I'm glad to see that President Obama is backing off this idea we're going to leave in 2011 and talk about 2014 and make everything conditions-based.\n\nYou know, I worry that we're going to fumble the ball in Iraq. President -- Mr. Allawi, the biggest vote-getter in the recent elections, who is a Shia who married up with Sunnis to give a different vision for -- for Iraq, has said that this the new government is a joke. If he feels that, that's disappointing.\n\nIt's very important we get a government formed in Iraq that's inclusive, that represents the results of the Iraqi election, and that is a reliable partner with the United States and the region.\n\nSo I've got concerns about this new government. But we need to stay involved -- effectively involved. And I'm in the camp of the Republican Party that wants to work with President Obama to end it well in Iraq, to get it right in Afghanistan, contain Iran through effective sanctions.\n\nAnd to my friends in the Republican Party who want to withdraw, you do so at your own peril, but the administration has to do their part. They're not being as effective as I think they can be in Iraq and Afghanistan. And when it comes to Iran, our sanctions efforts are not working as well as I would like, so I'd ask them to step up their game, as well.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Secretary Albright, do you think Iraq is -- I mean, you just heard Senator Graham saying he's worried that it's not inclusive and it's not reliable, this -- this new government.\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, it's a work in progress. I mean, there's no question about that. And every day brings a somewhat different story.\n\nI -- I do think that the American government is very involved. Vice President Biden has been talking to them, as have our ambassadors, in a variety of places, so I do think that it is a difficult process. We do need Iraq...\n\nAMANPOUR: The Sunnis just walked out.\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, no, they came back.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right, but...\n\nALBRIGHT: But I think that we are going to be watching this, but they understand that we will be there, and I agree that we need to make sure that the place works.\n\nI think that the administration is committed to that, and it is committed, also, to making Afghanistan work. I think the issue is -- as Senator Graham said, winning, I don't know what that means at the moment, but I do think that we need to have stability in both those countries, and I see the administration as looking outward. We are the strongest country in the world, and we do need partners, and that is what diplomacy's about.\n\nAMANPOUR: Discussion to be continued. Secretary Albright, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nAnd, Senator Graham, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us this morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: And as we've heard, America's growing debt is having an impact on the international stage. The draft recommendations released by the co-chairs of the president's deficit commission add up to nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction through 2020.\n\nBut the proposed spending cuts -- Social Security and Medicare cuts -- and tax increases are getting a chilly reception from Democrats and Republicans, a sure sign of the difficult task ahead, while deep spending cuts in Europe are bringing people to the streets in protest.\n\nTwo members of the commission appointed by President Obama are with us this morning: David Cote, chairman and CEO of Honeywell and Democratic Senator Kent Conrad.\n\nThank you both for coming. Welcome to both of you. You were just on President Obama's trip abroad. How does this deficit and the big troubles and problems ahead with this play in trying to gin up business abroad, jobs?\n\nCOTE: Well, I think everything ends up being interconnected. You certainly, in my view, want increased trade. Trade, I'm -- you might expect I believe is a good thing, and it benefits both sides, and you want to have countries arguing about commercial issues, not geographic issues. I think it makes a lot of sense.\n\nAMANPOUR: You know, Americans are worried that their jobs are going overseas. You've said that it can't be seen as a zero-sum game.\n\nCOTE: Well, that's one of my issues. And, quite honestly, I think the media helps to perpetuate this, is that economics is viewed as a zero-sum game, my loss is your gain, my gain is your loss.\n\nAnd the only reason you do things economically is because both sides win. When you go to the store and you buy something, the store's happy, you're happy. You both benefit. And that seems to get lost when we start talking about economics on a grander scale.\n\nAMANPOUR: Senator Conrad, there has been so much talk now about the recommendations by the co-chairs of the -- of the -- of the deficit commission, the fiscal commission. Is there any area you think that there's going to be any compromise on this? I mean, they're attacking and talking about really sacrosanct parts of the American political sphere here.\n\nCONRAD: You know, a certain amount of this is shock therapy. You know, there are different options. And, of course, what everybody has fashioned -- fastened on are the most extreme of the options.\n\nBut, look, the important thing for people to know is we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. That's utterly unsustainable; it can't continue much longer, so it's got to be dealt with.\n\nIf you look at our spending, it's the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, so we're going to have to work both sides of the equation.\n\nIt's critically important we do or we will become a second-rate economic power. That is the hard reality.\n\nAMANPOUR: But in terms of things like mortgage interest and all those things that the panel is recommending, these are things that Americans have really relied on forever, just about, and so many of them. Is that even a starter?\n\nCONRAD: Well, there is -- as I referenced earlier, there is one proposal that eliminates all the tax preferences, all the tax deductions, all the tax exclusions, and uses 90 percent of the revenue to reduce rates, only 10 percent to reduce the deficit. I don't favor that approach.\n\nI think we need something that represents a continuation of the mortgage deduction, although reformed, to apply only to primary residences, for example, but we need to continue the child credit, we need to continue the earned income tax credit.\n\nBut fundamentally, if we're going to raise revenue, I don't think the way to do it is to raise rates. I think the way to do it is to eliminate some of the loopholes that exist in the system. We have a tax system now that is just loaded -- chockablock full of preferences, loopholes. We're allowing $100 billion a year to be lost to offshore tax havens, another $50 billion to abuse of tax shelters. That can't be allowed to continue.\n\nAMANPOUR: And on another -- well, on the same issue, but Paul Krugman, the economist, Nobel Prize-winner, who's going to be on our roundtable, has written this week that it really is basically tax breaks again for the rich and more onus on the -- on the middle class dressed up as something new.\n\nCOTE: Well, in my view, democracy seems to be uniquely suited to putting a traffic light up after the fourth accident. Now, we can't wait for the fourth accident here.\n\nAnd that's why I applaud Senator Conrad, for Senator Graham, when -- his comments, trying to get out in front of something, because it's too easy for the demagogues and the polemicists to respond to something, just kind of go into their neutral corner and screaming, as opposed to saying there's a time to pull together.\n\nThis is one of those times. There are times when we should pull apart and pluralism and all that good stuff where people argue their point of view, but there are times when we have to pull together, and this is one of those times.\n\nAnd it scares me that as a financially conversant CEO, I didn't know how bad this was going to get in the next 10 years. I could see where it was today, but I couldn't see what was going to happen in the next 10 years, because people want to point to stuff like Obamacare, stimulus, Bush tax cuts. And the thing that everybody misses is it's my generation, the baby boomers, who are going to flow through Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. It's going to crush the system.\n\nAnd I think the American public is ready for this discussion, but I don't see anybody having that discussion with them, and that needs to happen.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, are the Democrats going to allow these cuts that have been suggested in Social Security, Medicare?\n\nCONRAD: Well, I'm a Democrat...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well?\n\nCONRAD: ... and I'm saying to my colleagues...\n\nAMANPOUR: And the liberal wing of the party?\n\nCONRAD: ... it is absolutely imperative that we take this on for the country's sake. And are we going to have to make some changes to Social Security? Certainly we are. Social Security is going to go cash negative in five years. It's going to go broke in 2037.\n\nMedicare, we've just extended the life of it by the health care reform package, which has gotten almost no attention, but still it's prepared to go permanently cash negative in just 10 years. So, obviously, those things have to be reformed; there have to be some changes.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me talk about the international implications of the currency wars that we were just talking about that came up during the Seoul trip. Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, has said that America's pursuing a policy of weakening its currency, and this is what the current treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, said in response to that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGEITHNER: I have enormous respect for Alan Greenspan, of course, had the privilege of working with him for a long period of years, but that's not an accurate description of either the Federal Reserve's policies or our policy. We will never seek to weaken our currency as a tool to gaining competitive advantage or to grow our economy. It's not an effective strategy for any country, certainly not for the United States.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, how do you assess, first, what the QE2 is, which is what he's talking about, quantitative easing? And isn't that viewed as -- certainly overseas -- as an attempt to weaken the currency, just as they're accusing China of doing?\n\nCOTE: Well, I would say managing currency is beyond my pay grade, so I don't normally get into that one. But I would say, in my view...\n\nAMANPOUR: But the affects thereof in business is your pay grade.\n\nCOTE: But I would say -- well, I was one of the guys -- I've been in favor of everything. So when they were talking about stimulus, home modification, the Federal Reserve is doing what they needed to, I don't think the country realized how close we were to a depression.\n\nAnd I've said to the senator several times: I don't think any politician ever gets credit for the problem they avoid. They get a lot of credit if they're in the middle of the crisis and start screaming and yelling, but avoiding a problem doesn't get a lot of merit. This deficit is one of those situations.\n\nAMANPOUR: Were you -- were you shocked that -- that the president could not close a trade deal with Seoul, a major ally? The United States has propped up South Korea, troops there. I mean, how is this possible?\n\nCONRAD: No, I'm not at all shocked. In fact, I think the president -- what he did is a show of strength, rather than weakness.\n\nAMANPOUR: How?\n\nCONRAD: Because he refused to take a bad deal. Look, I've been deeply involved with negotiating with our Korean friends, and they have used every stratagem to avoid previous commitments they have made. And the president called them on it and said, look, you said you would open our market, your market, and you've got an obligation to do it, and I'm not going to accept just any deal in order to have a deal.\n\nThank goodness we've got a president now who is standing up, even to some of our allies, and saying we're insisting on fair treatment.\n\nAMANPOUR: And what did you think when some of our allies called American policy clueless, economic policy?\n\nCONRAD: Well, this was separate...\n\nAMANPOUR: That doesn't show a huge amount of respect.\n\nCONRAD: Yeah, this was separate from...\n\nAMANPOUR: Right.\n\nCONRAD: ... separate from the Korean deal. This -- this involved the question of what the Federal Reserve was doing, which is not the president.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right\n\nCONRAD: This is the Federal Reserve policy to inject liquidity into the economy, given the fact 1 in every 6 people in this country is either underemployed or unemployed, so certainly additional steps need to be taken. I think it's very clear on the fiscal side we've about run the course. There's not going to be another stimulus package.\n\nSo if there's going to be more liquidity, it's going to have to come on the monetary side from the Federal Reserve. And to say that they're clueless, I think, frankly, demeans those who make the charge.\n\nLook, we have -- I would be quick to remind them -- we have saved their bacon over and over and over all across Europe. They need to remember who's been there for them when they needed help.\n\nAMANPOUR: On that note, Senator, Mr. Cote, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nAnd coming up next, analysis on our roundtable, with George Will, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and foreign policy analyst Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBUSH: And it's too bad they call them the Bush tax cuts. They might have a better chance of being extended if they were the Lauer tax cuts.\n\nBOEHNER: I think extending all of the current tax rates and making them permanent will reduce the uncertainty in America.\n\nOBAMA: I continue to believe that extending permanently the upper-income tax cuts would be a mistake and that we can't afford it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: The back-and-forth on whether to extend the Bush tax cuts, one of the topics for our roundtable with George Will, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of the New York Times, Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus, and Robert Kagan, foreign policy analyst and author from the Brookings Institution.\n\nThank you all for joining us. Thank you for being here.\n\nThe deficit commission, we had two members just -- just -- just earlier. You've written very, very strongly about a lot of the proposals, among other things, saying this proposal clearly represents a major transfer of income upward from the middle class to a small minority of wealthy Americans.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes. I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all.\n\nBut, you know, anybody, it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while padding my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?\n\nAMANPOUR: What should they have done?\n\nKRUGMAN: What they -- what they were supposed to do was produce something that was good enough to have an up-and-down vote, something that a lot of people could sign on to, and they did not do that.\n\nIn particular, now, leaving aside the distributional stuff -- which is awful -- the core of the deficit problem, everybody who's serious knows the core is health care costs, and you have to reduce health care costs, not reduce them, but reduce the rate of growth. The way you have to do that is by deciding what you're going to be willing to pay for.\n\nThey completely wimped out on that. They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary.\n\nSo the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on Earth is that doing in there?\n\nAMANPOUR: What on Earth, George?\n\nWILL: Well, Paul is speaking about the commission in the past tense, as though it has just reported. If fact, 2 of 18 members have now given their ideas; the other 16 have yet to be heard from.\n\nThe most interesting thing they did propose, interesting, A, because it's somewhat radical and, B, because it's opaque as to what it means is a 21 percent limit on revenues, not on spending, but on revenues. And I don't know what a cap means.\n\nOne Congress can't bind the other, and I don't know how institutionally how that would work, but certainly raising the early retirement age to 64 is overdue. Raising the retirement age under Social Security to 69 by 2075 is dilatory, should be done next Thursday.\n\nAMANPOUR: A goer at all? I mean, certainly, the liberals are screaming bloody murder over this.\n\nMARCUS: Actually, both sides are screaming bloody murder. And like most people screaming bloody murder, I think they're behaving incredibly childishly...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you've told the president to be professorial about this, didn't you?\n\nMARCUS: Professorial and the grown-up...\n\nAMANPOUR: Written about it, anyway.\n\nMARCUS: ... and the grown-up in the room. I agree with what Senator Conrad said. The non-report, the recommendations from the co-chairs were a useful dose of shock therapy just to educate people about the incredible gulf that we have between the government that any reasonable person wants.\n\nYou could have a discussion about what size it should be and the revenue that we have to fund it going forward, and you need to understand the scope of the problem before you can agree on solutions.\n\nRight now, 75 percent of people believe you could balance the budget without touching Medicare or Social Security; 75 percent of people believe that you can balance the budget without raising taxes. Well, you could, but it would be extraordinarily painful.\n\nPeople need to get a little bit of reality therapy. There's going to be another dose coming on Wednesday when another group is going to submit their recommendations, very concrete recommendations about how to do it. That's the conversation we need to have before we start picking apart solutions.\n\nKRUGMAN: If they were going to do reality therapy, they should have said, OK, look, Medicare is going to have to decide what it's going to pay for. And at least for starters, it's going to have to decide which medical procedures are not effective at all and should not be paid for at all. In other words, it should have endorsed the panel that was part of the health care reform.\n\nIf it's not even -- if the commission isn't even brave enough to take on the death panels people, then it's doing no good at all. It's not educating the public. It's not telling people about the kinds of choices that need to be made.\n\nMARCUS: But they did talk about -- just -- just as a fact, they did talk about strengthening that commission, the famous IPAB...\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes.\n\nMARCUS: ... and giving it more power to go after more aspects of the health care system, which -- because it's now rather constrained.\n\nKRUGMAN: They made no headlines with that. And some friends of mine are calling this the commission -- the commission to put caps on lots of stuff. It's a lot of numerical caps without any explanation of how they're going to happen.\n\nAMANPOUR: What about the tax fight which is going to come up? I mean, does that even register with -- in terms of -- in terms of the Brookings Institution, in terms of what you're looking at?\n\nKAGAN: It certainly registers with one-half of the Brookings Institution. It doesn't happen to be the half that I'm in, but, I mean, I think that clearly the whole bundle of issues are going to have to be dealt with together, including, by the way, issues like the national security budget and defense budget, which I think a lot of people think, oh, there's a good pot of money we can go into, but if you look at the foreign policy of this administration, I don't see where they're going to be able to find those kinds of savings.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, we had Rand Paul on last week and he said, for instance, he is willing to talk about cuts in military spending. He thought that that was one area where perhaps a wing of Republicans could start talking about in return for a wing of Democrats who could talk about real cuts in Social Security and Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: ... Secretary Gates is talking about that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Precisely.\n\nWILL: Secretary Gates doesn't want to buy any more C-17s. He wants to put a lid on F-22. There are lots of ways of...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: Can I just get into magnitudes here, though? The cost of permanently extending just the upper-end Bush tax cuts, as opposed to only extending the middle-class tax cuts, the 75-year cost of that is just about identical to the 75-year accounting shortfall in Social Security. So we've got people who are saying, oh, Social Security, got to do something about it, but let's extend those tax cuts for rich people. This is showing how the priorities are all skewed (ph).\n\nAMANPOUR: But what is going to happen? I mean, are you clear on where a compromise is going to be? It's got to be discussed before the end of the year, no?\n\nKRUGMAN: No. Some years down the pike, we're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes. It's going to be that we're actually going to take Medicare under control, and we're going to have to get some additional revenue, probably from a VAT. But it's not going to happen now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: ... on the tax thing, for the Bush -- yes, the specific...\n\nMARCUS: I think we know where this is coming out. It's not where it should come out, but I think because everybody agrees that we're going to extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of the people, and because the president doesn't have the votes to not extend the rest, what we're going to do is have some kind of extension for a few years, perhaps, and Senator Warner from Virginia has suggested this. Perhaps we could tweak those cuts to actually make them more attractive to business, more stimulative, more intelligent.\n\nThis is not my preference. I think that the conversation right now is deranged. We have in one room the deficit commission folks saying, \"Look at this huge hole. Look at the tax increases and serious spending cuts that we need to do to fill it.\" And then outside the room, we're having a debate about whether we should add $4 trillion to the deficit long term or a mere $3.3 trillion. This is crazy.\n\nWILL: All the tax cuts are going to be extended. They will not be decoupled. We'll have this argument two, maybe three years from now.\n\nNotice what Paul referred to, the value-added tax. Some while ago, it was thought that this was kind of big bomb that the deficit commission would come in with, an entire new source of revenues. They did not notice that last April the Senate voted 83-13 on a resolution condemning the value-added tax. It will not happen.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's take it overseas. I mean, there is obviously in Britain a value-added tax. There's this debate going on right now in England, in France, Ireland, all over the place, and they're doing serious austerity. And people are asking, can their economies handle that?\n\nWhat do you think is going to be the picture in -- in Britain over the next few years?\n\nKAGAN: Well, it's going to be some very extreme austerity...\n\nAMANPOUR: People are already on the streets.\n\nKAGAN: Right. I mean, we'll see how -- I think that probably Cameron has enough of a -- of a -- of a majority in parliament to hang on, if he's tough. I mean, Sarkozy is fighting this battle right now in France. I think that they can probably hang on.\n\nBut there is a price to be paid. And, again, sorry to return to world affairs. I mean, Britain has taken itself out as a major player in the international system, at least for a while, with the kind of cuts that they've made in their national security budget.\n\nThe problem is, the United States doesn't have the luxury of doing that. I mean, Britain can become a free-rider in the international system, but that is the price that they've paid.\n\nAMANPOUR: And does this -- do these recommendations from the commission, do they amount to any kind of austerity?\n\nKRUGMAN: Oh, no. It's very, very different. Yes, it's austerity long run, although they're very vague about what form that takes. Again, it's caps without real explanation of how they're going to happen.\n\nBut there's a huge difference. There's two kinds of austerity. There's doing things to bring down your long-run costs, which is what Sarkozy is doing in France -- he's trying to change their retirement age -- and slashing right now, when you're in the middle of a deeply depressed economy, which is what Cameron is doing.\n\nThe first I'm all in favor of, if you do it right. The second is basically crazy, but that's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: So where do you see the British economy going?\n\nKRUGMAN: And we're going to have -- we're going to have Cameron-type austerity in this country, not as a deliberate policy, but because the state and local governments are going to be slashing their spending. There's going to be no further aid coming from -- from Washington.\n\nAnd so, if you look at the global government budget -- global in the sense of all levels of government in the United States -- we're heading -- we're in Herbert Hoover territory in the United States for sure.\n\nAMANPOUR: I just want to switch a little bit to -- to what you heard Senator Lindsey Graham saying about Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq, he's not happy at all with the -- with the current government and doesn't think the U.S. administration has done a good job. What do you think about that?\n\nWILL: I don't think it's the administration's job to pick Iraq's government, which it's powerless to do. Look, every four years, we flood this little state of New Hampshire with politicians, journalists, poll-takers, political scientists, candidates, consultants, and at the end of the day, we're surprised by what they do in New Hampshire. Why should we be surprised that we're surprised at what the Iraqis are doing?\n\nKAGAN: Well, we don't have -- we don't have, you know, almost 100,000 troops or 50,000 in this case, 50,000 troops in New Hampshire, which might have a greater impact on what voters did. And the truth is, we have been an occupying power in Iraq. We can't pretend that we're not.\n\nIt matters greatly to us what kind of government Iraq has. And I really think the administration -- especially during Chris Hill's ambassadorship -- just took a hands-off attitude. It matters. And it matters before there has to be a feeling among all the different ethic sectarian groups in Iraq that they have some purchase in this government. And right now it feels to them like a Shia government, which is not necessarily...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, talk about the hands-off, because, obviously, during General Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, when he was the ambassador, there was a real hands-on, a real sense of guiding and shaping. Which is better?\n\nKAGAN: Well, when you're the occupying force, you have to have some guiding and shaping. I mean, when we finally leave Iraq, we'll have to leave it to whatever -- you know, the tender mercies of its own political system, which will be -- have its own dysfunctionalities. That's fine.\n\nBut right now, we're looking to pull out. We need to have a government that is capable of satisfying these needs so we don't see the return of Al Qaida in force or you don't see the return of terrorism, which -- which is going to make it harder for us to leave.\n\nAMANPOUR: In Afghanistan, they're trying to do the same thing in Afghanistan, and you've just seen the Washington Post article saying that Karzai does not like the night raids. You heard what Lindsey Graham is saying, that's very disappointing, it's that -- that's the backbone of their strategy right now, and that he heard nothing about that from Karzai.\n\nWhere is Karzai's head right now, do you think, on this?\n\nKAGAN: Well, I'm not sure I know where Karzai's head is, but I do think we have to recognize he's in a difficult position. I don't -- by the way, I'm not totally sympathetic to him, but I am a little bit sympathetic.\n\nHe's the head of a country that's an occupied country that's at war where there are civilian casualties, and -- and he's a politician. And so as a politician, he's reacting to this. But do I think that he wants the United States to pull out of Afghanistan? No. Does he have to say things which look like he's unhappy about some of the things we're doing? Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: So I want to put up this latest commercial about \"don't ask\/don't tell.\" I want to show you what Cindy McCain has been saying, talking about war policy and the military.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPINSKY: LGBT teens are six to nine times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers.\n\nC. MCCAIN: Our political and religious leaders tell LGBT youth that they have no future.\n\nNAVARRO: They can't get married.\n\nC. MCCAIN: They can't serve our country openly.\n\nBERGERON: What's worse, these laws that legislate discrimination...\n\nPROBST: ... teach bullies that what they're doing is acceptable.\n\nC. MCCAIN: Our government treats the LGBT community like second-class citizens. Why shouldn't they?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, that's one issue of the gay situation right now, but particularly gays in the military. Do you think in a lame-duck session that they're going to vote on this, on \"don't ask\/don't tell\"?\n\nWILL: A, I don't think they will. And, B, if they don't do it, it won't happen for at least two more years.\n\nKRUGMAN: No real opinion on that.\n\nMARCUS: I don't think they'll get it done in the lame-duck. The fascinating thing about Cindy McCain is she's put out a statement saying, well, actually she also agrees with her husband's position, wait, wait, wait, don't do it right now on \"don't ask\/don't tell.\"\n\nKAGAN: Exactly.\n\nAMANPOUR: And what's extraordinary, though, is that so many former military chiefs, so many of the former defense secretaries actually back repealing \"don't ask\/don't tell,\" and it looks, again -- thanks to the Washington Post -- it looks like the Pentagon review shows that the military in general say that it will have no effect.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how, in this day and age, when you need as many people as you can fighting these wars, when you have our allies who have open gays serving in the military, how it's still this issue here and why you don't think it's going to be taken up in the lame-duck session?\n\nWILL: Well, you referred to a lot of former military people.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, right, but they have experience.\n\nWILL: Well, check with the...\n\nAMANPOUR: They've been there.\n\nWILL: Check with the commandant of the Marine Corps, which is a small service...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, I know the commandant of the Marine Corps, but...\n\nWILL: ... a small service that's specialty is small-unit combat, and that's where they think the issue matters most (ph).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: But the review is meant to suggest that the military thinks that it won't have any impact.\n\nWILL: Then the -- then the review is not representing a consensus of the military.\n\nMARCUS: It's irrational. It's incoherent. It's going to end, but slowly.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, we're going to talk about this -- hopefully, you'll talk about more of this in the roundtable, because it is really fascinating. And if it won't come up for another two years, that's a long time down the road.\n\nSo -- and the roundtable does continue in the green room at abcnews.com\/thisweek, where you can also find our fact-checks in conjunction with PolitiFact.\n\nStill to come, \"In Memoriam,\" the Sunday funnies, and the story of a politician who won an election and then had it taken away from him. You won't believe why.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: The midterm election here in the United States was the most expensive and also one of the most negative campaigns in recent history. Many candidates simply misrepresented their opponent's positions with little consequence, but not so in Britain, where as ABC's Jim Sciutto reports, one politician learned a hard lesson in truth in advertising.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCIUTTO (voice-over): For a country that's raised campaign mud-slinging to high art...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Reid actually voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Taliban Dan Webster.\n\nSCIUTTO: ... British politics can sound pretty tame.\n\n(UNKNOWN): The right honorable gentleman...\n\nSCIUTTO: And they may just have gotten tamer. Philip Woolas, parliament member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, was hustled out of office, his May election victory overturned for allegedly lying about his opponent.\n\nSTEWART: So, wait, in Britain, politicians can lose their seat for making false statements about their opponents? Wow, that's how our people get elected.\n\nSCIUTTO: This was the offending flier, which accused his opponent of wooing Islamic extremists.\n\nWOOLAS: I was devastated by the process.\n\nSCIUTTO: The now-former M.P. spoke to ABC News exclusively.\n\n(on-screen): It's an enormous price to pay. You won an election, and you've had that seat taken away from you.\n\nWOOLAS: The case hinged around in the end three lines in a leaflet. I took responsibility for that leaflet, but my election team actually wrote it, because he's not a criminal. This is an election matter. It's about who said what to who when. To my mind, it's the stuff of politics.\n\nSCIUTTO (voice-over): The stuff of dirty politics, two British judges ruled, dirty enough to nullify an election for the first time here in 99 years. Not surprisingly, Woolas' opponent, the target of those fliers and loser of the election, welcomed the ruling.\n\nWATKINS: If you lie to the electorate, you have no place in politics.\n\nSCIUTTO: The decision has sparked a firestorm, his own party abandoning him, but others warning of a chilling effect on free speech.\n\n(on-screen): Like in the U.S., there are many here who aren't sorry to see a politician pay a price for lying, but critics of the decision say there is already a way to punish them, the parliamentary elections themselves. Let the voters, not a judge, decide.\n\n(voice-over): The judges in Woolas' case may have changed the very way elections are run here, perhaps, some say, with a wary look across the Atlantic.\n\n(on-screen): Is there any sense that British people, British voters in general, look to America and say, \"We just don't want to go that far. We see how bad it can get\"?\n\nFREEDLAND: There's definitely a recoil, a cringe almost in British politics about being told they're going down the American politics route.\n\nSCIUTTO (voice-over): Pending Woolas' appeal, British politicians will now face a rule almost unheard of in American politics: think before they sling.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Jim Sciutto, ABC News, London.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And finally this morning, from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, a rare image of freedom. Pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest yesterday, where she's been held for 15 of the past 21 years. Despite their best efforts, the military junta has never succeeded in crushing her supporters' hope for freedom.\n\nThat's our program for today. Thank you for watching, and we hope to see you next week.",

    "text":"Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image \u2014 in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's \u2014 will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution \u2014 was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: \"If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a \"wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\"\n\nIn what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.\n\nRouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.\n\nLast but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.\n\nNetanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.\n\nThe irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.\n\nFor now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.",

    "text":"A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran.\n\n\n\nThe ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a \"broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists.\" A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya.\n\n\n\nA female voiceover says, \"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology.\" (The words \"an apology\" flash across the screen.)\n\n\n\nThen it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, \"Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.\"\n\n\n\nThe voiceover says, \"He reached out.\"\n\n\n\nObama: \"It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran.\"\n\n\n\nVoiceover: \"Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. \u2026Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. It\u2019s time to stop Iran.\"\n\n\n\nThe claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth.\n\n\n\nHis first interview\n\n\n\nObama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al Arabiya\u2019s Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias.\n\n\n\nNews coverage at the time billed the interview as Obama\u2019s \"first television interview in the White House,\" according to the New York Times, and \"his first formal television interview as president,\" per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new president\u2019s first.\n\n\n\nThe Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obama\u2019s diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s fair to say this was Obama\u2019s first interview as president.\n\n\n\nNo apology\n\n\n\nThe interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nObama responds:\n\nWell, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals.\n\nAnd so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response.\n\nUltimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table.\n\nAnd it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress.\n\nThe ad uses only his comments, \"Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.\" But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we don\u2019t agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect.\n\n\n\nLater, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, \"My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that.\"\n\n\n\nNowhere in the interview did Obama use the word \"apology,\" \"apologize\" or \"sorry.\"\n\n\n\nPolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world.\n\n\n\nBut again, there isn\u2019t an \"I\u2019m sorry\" anywhere to be found in Obama\u2019s speeches or remarks. One expert we\u2019ve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.\n\n\n\n\"It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,\" John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. \"Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.\"\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nSecure America Now\u2019s ad says, \"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology.\" The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that.\n\n\n\nBy saying \"all too often the United States starts by dictating,\" Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. What\u2019s more, the ad criticizes Obama\u2019s approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n\n\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

    "text":"Impeachment talk becomes a cynical game\n\nOn Friday, a top White House aide said it was possible Republicans could impeach President Obama if he decided to take executive action on immigration. Days later, on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner fired back at this impeachment chatter: \u201cListen, it\u2019s all a scam started by Democrats at the White House.\u201d But let\u2019s be honest here: Both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- believe the impeachment talk is good for motivating their base. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it\u2019s raked in more than $3 million in online donations since Thursday with solicitations like this one from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (\u201cBoehner is planning a vote to sue the president. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step\u201d). Democrats also hope the impeachment talk can force a replay of 1998, when the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton backfired against the GOP that midterm season. As for Boehner and House Republicans, they\u2019re being disingenuous, too. The GOP base loves the impeachment talk (see Sarah Palin, Allen West, Drudge, and the rhetoric from some sitting House members). Indeed, Boehner\u2019s lawsuit seems intended to tap into that conservative impeachment enthusiasm -- but without going all the way to impeachment. It\u2019s impeachment-lite. The House will vote tonight on that lawsuit against the president, per NBC\u2019s Frank Thorp.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beneath the White House and the speaker\n\nSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country\u2019s problems. (Republicans: \u201cThis President is breaking the law!\u201d Democrats: \u201cThey want to impeach the president!\u201d) And what\u2019s particularly jarring is that this isn\u2019t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s beneath the White House, and it\u2019s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren\u2019t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.\n\nA Tale of Two Bills\n\nDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American\u2019s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that\u2019s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn\u2019t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that\u2019s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn\u2019t). In the case of the border, there just isn\u2019t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.\n\nHouse GOP \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about ability to get 218 votes for border bill\n\nAs for the House GOP\u2019s $659 million border bill, NBC\u2019s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are \u201ccautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a \u2018brick wall\u2019 in the House.\u201d Then again, it\u2019s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.\n\nLatest on the Highway Trust Fund standoff\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: \u201cThe Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,\u201d Roll Call reports. \u201cAfter the Senate\u2019s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 \u2014 Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a \u2018free vote\u2026because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out \u2014 after they\u2019ve left\u2019 for the August recess.\u201d So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund \u201ccliff\u201d of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.\n\nEconomy grew by 4% in 2nd quarter\n\nMore good economic news: \u201cAfter a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,\u201d the AP says. \u201cThe Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.\u201d\n\nTom Steyer\u2019s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in Iowa\n\nThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate\u2019s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it\u2019s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer\u2019s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science \u2018deniers,\u2019 elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer\u2019s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.\n\nPoll: Kasich still leading in Ohio\n\nA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio\u2019s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it\u2019s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He\u2019s still not out of the woods, but he\u2019s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.\n\nDueling coal ads in West Virginia\n\nDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia\u2019s Senate race hitting her party\u2019s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn\u2019t seem to be taking any chances here\n\nThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial\n\nIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: \u201cLawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her \u2018favorite playmate.\u2019 The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,\u201d NBC Washington\u2019s Julie Carey reported. More: \u201cThe couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. \u2018You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,\u2019 Burck said.\u201d Here\u2019s what\u2019s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.

Nuclear nightmare scenario inJapan. How prepared is the United States? Could it happen here?Libya and Japan, two crises with major consequences for the UnitedStates.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, D.C., \"ThisWeek\" with Christiane Amanpour, \"Target Libya,\" starts right now.\n\nAMANPOUR: As we begin our broadcast, the United States is at warin a third Muslim country, Libya. We'll take you there live in just amoment. ABC's team of correspondents is covering every angle of thisstory. I will have an exclusive interview with Moammar Gadhafi's sonand close adviser, Saif al-Islam. And I'll be joined here in thestudio by Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,to discuss what's being called Operation Odyssey Dawn.\n\nBut first, the latest headlines in this fast-moving story. Adefiant Moammar Gadhafi is promising a long war, one day after theUnited States and a broad international coalition launched militarystrikes on his country. British and American ships and submarinesfired 112 cruise missiles at more than 20 targets on the coast.\n\nAmerican B-2 bombers took out a Libyan airfield, all part of thelargest Western military intervention in the Arab world since thestart of the Iraq war. The show of force is designed to impose a no-fly zone to prevent the Libyan strongman from firing on his ownpeople.\n\nSunday, Tripoli shook with the sound of explosions and anti-aircraft fire. Libyan state television reported that 48 people hadbeen killed.\n\nBut today, in a phone call to state television, Gadhafi saidLibyans stand ready to fight what he calls \"crusaders.\" This is afight, he says, that he will win.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nM. GADHAFI (through translator): You are not capable of aprolonged -- for a prolonged war in Libya. We consider ourselvesready for a long war. Be aware of that. We're not retreatinganywhere, because this is our land. This is where we're staying.Then you're going to return defeated.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Joining me on the line from Tripoli in Libya, Saif al-Islam, Colonel Gadhafi's second son and close adviser.\n\nSaif, thank you for joining me. Can you tell me right now, whereare you? And what is happening there right now?\n\nGADHAFI: You know, we are in Tripoli, as you know. Butyesterday, we were surprised that -- you know, the Americans and theBritish and the French attacked Libya, attacked five cities,terrorized people, and (inaudible) children, women were so afraidyesterday, heavy bombing everywhere. So it was a big surprise that,finally, President Obama -- we thought he's a good man and friend ofArab world -- is bombing Libya.\n\nAMANPOUR: Saif, President Obama very explicitly gave your fatheran ultimatum and said cease fire, stop, and this won't happen. Hethen had to say that the attacks continue and the United States cannotsit idly by while a leader says that there will be no mercy. Why didyour father continue the attacks in Benghazi? Why didn't he have acease fire?\n\nGADHAFI: First of all, our people went to Benghazi to liberateBenghazi from the gangsters and the armed militia. So if you -- ifthe Americans want to -- want to help the Libyan people in Benghazi,so go to Benghazi and liberate Benghazi from the militia and theterrorists. So do it.\n\nAMANPOUR: My question, though, is, there is now missile strikesand an air attack against Libya. Will Colonel Gadhafi step down?Will he step aside?\n\nGADHAFI: Step aside why? I mean, to step -- again, there's abig misunderstanding. The whole country is united against the armedmilitia and the terrorists. You asked -- simply, the Americans andother Western countries, you are supporting the terrorists and thearmed militia. That's it.\n\nAMANPOUR: Saif, will there be Libyan retaliation against, let'ssay, commercial flights around the Mediterranean or other targets?\n\nGADHAFI: No, this is not our target. Our target is how to helpour people in Libya, especially in Benghazi. Believe me, they areliving a nightmare, a nightmare, really, a nightmare. They have nofreedom, nothing under the rule of the armed militia.\n\nSo we urge the Americans either to go there themselves and helpour people there or let the Libyan people help their brothers inBenghazi. But believe me, one day, you wake up and you will find outthat you were supporting the wrong people. And you are being a bigmistake with supporting those people. It's like the WMD in Iraq.It's another story.\n\nAMANPOUR: Saif al-Islam, thank you very much, indeed, forjoining us from Tripoli.\n\nGADHAFI: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: So that's the view from the Gadhafis in Tripoli.Let's go to eastern Libya, the rebel stronghold where ABC's AlexanderMarquardt joins us live.\n\nSo what is the mood there where you are?\n\nMARQUARDT: Good morning, Christiane. We are in Tubruq, ineastern Libya, where an opposition spokesman told us this morning thatmorale is sky high. They've been pleading for military interventionfor weeks. They now feel that there's a level playing field, that therebels will be able to push the Gadhafi forces out of the east, awayfrom cities like Ajdabiya and Benghazi that have seen heavy fightingover the last few days. Eventually, they want to make their way toTripoli, where they plan to oust Gadhafi.\n\nWe spoke with people on the streets. They're understandably veryhappy, thanking the coalition for what they've done, specificallyFrance and the U.K., for introducing the resolution at the U.N. Theybelieve that this intervention will lead to victory and eventually toa free Libya.\n\nBut with this change in tide comes a period of insurgency. Theopposition spokesman said that this is the scary part, because of howillogical Gadhafi is and because of -- because of what he calls histhirst for blood.\n\nChristiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Alex, thanks.\n\nAnd now let's go to the capital Tripoli, again. That could soonbe ground zero in this conflict. Moammar Gadhafi is there, and so isthe BBC's Allan Little, who joins us now live.\n\nSo, Allan, you heard from the Gadhafis. You heard the mood inBenghazi. What do you think is the next move in Tripoli? And how arethey portraying it there?\n\nLITTLE: Well, fighting talk from Colonel Gadhafi, as from hisson, Saif, largely for domestic consumption. It's not hard to goaround the city and find people willing to echo those sentiments,diehard devotees of Colonel Gadhafi saying that -- people sayingthey're willing to die along with him if it comes to that.\n\nThere's no doubting the sincerity of those people, I think, andthe passion with which they speak. Their devotion then seems to getmore intense the more isolated he becomes from the world. Thequestion is, how representative is that voice? No other voice canmake itself heard here in the prevailing atmosphere in whichpatriotism for Libya is fused with devotion to the person of Gadhafihimself.\n\nWhat are those hundreds of thousands, if not millions of peoplewho do not take part in those demonstrations of devotion, really feeland think in the silence of their own heads? What is the realsentiment of Tripoli? That is simply impossible in this atmosphere togauge.\n\nAMANPOUR: Allan, thank you so much.\n\nAnd, of course, the leaders of Britain, France, and PresidentObama is keeping a close tab on the unfolding situation. ABC's JakeTapper is live at the White House.\n\nAnd, Jake, what from the White House is the end game here?What's the perspective from there?\n\nTAPPER: Good morning, Christiane. President Obama is in Brazil.But you talked on a very, very difficult question for the White House,because it's been the position of President Obama that there should beregime change in Libya, since March 3rd, when Obama said that Gadhafihas to go.\n\nBut that is not the goal of this military operation. The goal ofthis military operation officially is to impose a no-fly zone and toprotect civilians. Gadhafi stepping down is not part of it.\n\nSo what I would expect is that you will see more effortsinternationally to arm the Libyan rebels so that they will take intotheir own hands the goal of toppling Gadhafi. But that is notofficially the goal of this military operation, so it's a delicatedance for President Obama as he attempts to make this militaryoperation even more international than previous U.S. militaryoperations.\n\nAs you know, as we've talked about, there's been a huge effort bythe White House to make this seem as though the United States is notplaying a leading role, even though, of course, we have 11 ships inthe Mediterranean, five of which were firing Tomahawk missiles.There, of course, are other nations participating in the militaryoperation, France, the U.K., and others coming in the coming days, butright now, the U.S. is taking a major leadership role, although theObama administration wants to make this seem as though it is the worldagainst Gadhafi, not Obama and the U.S. against Gadhafi, Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: Jake, just very quickly, do you think the U.S. willarm the rebels?\n\nTAPPER: I think it's a distinct possibility that the U.S. willbe part of an international effort to do so. I would doubt very muchthat the U.S. would do so on its own.\n\nAMANPOUR: Jake, all right.\n\nAnd let's go now to Martha Raddatz. The U.S. is pledging, asJake said, to step back to a support role after the initial phase.Martha, you're there. You're covering the military. Is thathappening? Do you think it's realistic to go into a support role?It's obviously very unusual in these kinds of military interventions. RADDATZ: It's certainly unusual for the U.S. And right now, aU.S. general is in charge of the operation, General Carter Ham. Andyou have an admiral, Admiral Scott -- or Sam Locklear, who is on aship. And he is the tactical commander, meaning he is coordinatingall of these air strikes.\n\nBut in a few days, the hope is, the U.S. hopes that GeneralCarter Ham can turn over his responsibility to one of the coalitionmembers. That is the plan right now. I don't think they know whothat will be.\n\nBut in this initial phase, the U.S. does have uniquecapabilities, as the president keeps saying. You had stealth bombersgoing in there. You had the B-2 bombers going in there. You hadthese Tomahawk missiles on the ships. So the U.S. felt it had to takethe lead role in this phase.\n\nAnd this phase is, of course, to wipe out Gadhafi's air defenses.The next phase will be the no-fly zone. I do think the U.S. will beinvolved in that somewhat and will have fighters involved in that, butthe bulk of the no-fly zone will be flown by British pilots, Frenchpilots, and other allies.\n\nAMANPOUR: Martha, thank you so much.\n\nAnd joining me next, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff. And we'll put that to him. I'll ask him how themissions will work, when it will end, and whether it can succeed atall if Moammar Gadhafi remains in power.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome back.\n\nThough his son sounded subdued, Moammar Gadhafi himself wassounding undaunted this morning. He says his supporters are armed andprepared to fight, and he's pledging that this will be, quote, \"a longwar.\"\n\nJoining me now, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, AdmiralMike Mullen.\n\nThank you for joining us.\n\nMULLEN: Good morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is the United States leading this? Or is it in asupporting role?\n\nMULLEN: Well, actually, the French were the first ones inyesterday, in terms of starting to establish the no-fly zone. TheUnited States is taking the lead in terms of the coalition. GeneralCarter Ham, U.S. commander of U.S. AFRICOM, is actually the commanderright now. And we look to, in the next few days, transition that to acoalition leadership.\n\nAMANPOUR: So the U.S. will pull back?\n\nMULLEN: The U.S. will essentially take a supporting role,providing unique capabilities, certainly in terms of things likejamming, things like...\n\nAMANPOUR: But not bombing and flying over?\n\nMULLEN: No -- well, certainly, the -- we'll be in transition. Imean, effectively, Christiane, what's happened in the last 24 hours isthe no-fly zone has been put -- has essentially started to have itseffects. We've got aircraft over Benghazi right now. We have thatfor 24\/7. He hasn't flown any aircraft in the last two days. So theinitial part of the operation and the idea of getting a no-fly zone inplace is...\n\nAMANPOUR: Is successful?\n\nMULLEN: Well, it has been successful so far.\n\nAMANPOUR: So will it be a long war, as Colonel Gadhafi pledges?\n\nMULLEN: Well, we're very focused on the limited objectives thatthe president has given us and actually the international coalitionhas given us, in terms of providing the no-fly zone so that he cannotattack his own people, to avoid any kind of humanitarian massacre, ifyou will, and to provide for the humanitarian corridors, humanitariansupport of the Libyan people.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you say a limited objective, but we've heard fromthe president, we've heard from the secretary of state, Gadhafi has togo. Is that the military objective?\n\nMULLEN: Well, the military objective is -- is as I justdescribed it, in terms of -- the mission is very clear right now.It's to focus on getting this no-fly zone in place and to support theU.N. objectives of no humanitarian crisis and humanitarian support,protecting Libyan civilians.\n\nAMANPOUR: So it's possible that we could have, like Iraq, a 12-year no-fly zone with the strongman still in place?\n\nMULLEN: Well, again, I think circumstances will drive where thisgoes in the future. I wouldn't speculate in terms of length at thisparticular point in time. It's had a pretty significant effect veryearly in terms of our ability to address his forces -- to attack hisforces on the ground, which we did yesterday outside Benghazi, and getthe no-fly zone stood up.\n\nAMANPOUR: What about other countries, such as Bahrain, such asYemen? If the United States military is attacking to protectcivilians in Libya, why not in Bahrain and Yemen?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think, first of all, just back to Libya, a veryimportant part of this has been the Arab League vote to establish ano-fly zone and the -- the partners -- the coalition partners that arecoming into play with respect to Libya.\n\nAMANPOUR: Correct. But what's the logic?\n\nMULLEN: In terms of...\n\nAMANPOUR: Of other people being -- civilians being killed inother countries where the U.S. has an interest?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think -- I think we have to -- to be verycareful to treat every country differently. Certainly, there's atremendous change going on right now throughout the Middle East,including in Bahrain. And Bahrain is a much different -- in a muchdifferent situation than Libya.\n\nWe haven't had a relationship with Libya for a long, long time.The Bahrainis and that country has been a critical ally for decades.So we're working very hard to support a peaceful resolution there, astragic as it has been, and we certainly decry the violence which hasoccurred in Bahrain. I just think the approach there needs to bedifferent. AMANPOUR: Do you think the Libyans have the wherewithal toretaliate against the United States or its allies in the region orhere?\n\nMULLEN: I don't think -- from a military standpoint, certainly,they have some capability. And -- and yet, at least if I were to takethe first 24 hours or so, they've -- they've not been a very effectiveforce.\n\nPart of what you do when you go into this is you assume they havea fairly significant capability or the capability they have is gooduntil proven otherwise. We've taken out their air defense. We'veactually stopped -- attacked -- we've attacked some of their forces onthe ground in the vicinity of Benghazi. And yesterday they were onthe march to Benghazi. They were lobbing rockets and mortars inBenghazi...\n\nAMANPOUR: So Benghazi is safe?\n\nMULLEN: Well, Benghazi -- they're no longer marching there. Iwouldn't describe Benghazi as safe at this particular point in time.\n\nAMANPOUR: But even though you say you have to assume that theyhave some kind of capability, realistically, do you think Gadhafi canattack civilian aircraft targets and will do?\n\nMULLEN: Well, he still has -- from what I've seen this morning,he still has some surface-to-air capability, where he could attack anaircraft, including one of ours. We haven't seen large-scaleindications of that after the action yesterday. He clearly has theability to continue to attack his own people, and then we're veryfocused on that, and -- and trying to ensure that his military forcesdon't do that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Mustard gas stockpiles, is that a problem?\n\nMULLEN: Very closely monitored, and I haven't seen it as aproblem thus far.\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen, thank you very much, indeed, forjoining us.\n\nMULLEN: Thank you, Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we're covering the unfolding events in Libya fromall angles this morning. Up next, I'll speak with a leader of theopposition movement who until recently worked for Gadhafi himself. Hejoins me with unique insight into the Libyan strongman.\n\nAnd later, will a new war abroad bring a new threat here in theUnited States? Could Gadhafi retaliate on American soil? I'll putthat question to the former homeland security secretary, MichaelChertoff.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nH. CLINTON: The world will not sit idly by while more innocentcivilians are killed. We are standing with the people of Libya, andwe will not waver in our efforts to protect them.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So, as you heard his son, Saif, tell us, MoammarGadhafi remains in Tripoli, presumably hunkered down. His Tripolicompound is reportedly filled with hundreds of supporters, includingwomen and children. Could they make up a human shield, a possiblelast line of defense for the embattled leader?\n\nUntil just weeks ago, Ali Suleiman Aujali was Gadhafi's voice inthe United States, the Libyan ambassador to this country. But Aujalihas turned against Gadhafi and is now a leading voice of theopposition. He joins me here at the Newseum in Washington.\n\nAnd from New York, a man whose country led the call for airstrikes we're seeing right now, France's ambassador to the UnitedNations, Gerard Araud.\n\nGentlemen, welcome, both, to this program.\n\nAUJALI: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you first, former Ambassador Aujali, whatis in the mind of Gadhafi right now? This is a man you know, youserved. Under this threat, will he fold?\n\nAUJALI: I think there is one thing in the mind of Gadhafi, thathe will not step down at all. He will fight until the end.\n\nAMANPOUR: So everything that his son is telling us, that he'stelling us is not just bravado?\n\nAUJALI: Yeah.\n\nAMANPOUR: He will fight?\n\nAUJALI: He will fight. He will fight. He has no other choice.He has no shelter to go. And this is his -- his attitude. He willnever give up. ARAUD: Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: So how will this end?\n\nAUJALI: Well, the end -- now I think there is a good chanceafter the air strikes, after the revolutionaries being protected by --from the Gadhafi hitting, I think now they'll start marching to the --to the east. And we have to -- we have to break the siege againstTripoli. If Tripoli...\n\nAMANPOUR: So you're hoping that the rebels will keep marching onto the capital...\n\nAUJALI: Of course. Of course. Of course.\n\nAMANPOUR: ... and take on Gadhafi himself?\n\nAUJALI: Of course. Yeah, we have to open the road, you know, toGadhafi's -- where he's staying.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you, Ambassador Araud. This is pretty muchan extraordinary situation. There is a military intervention, andFrance is the country that has led it and that has really brought theUnited States to this situation. You're listening to the ambassadorhere, Aujali. Why is it that France took that decision?\n\nARAUD: Well, I think it was, first, I guess, a moral and humanreaction. It was impossible to consider a victory of Gadhafi andGadhafi taking Benghazi. He was himself saying what will happen. Hewas saying that they -- they will search house by house. He wasreferring to rivers of blood. It was simply totally impossible to --to accept it.\n\nYou have also to consider that, for us, Libya, the Maghreb, it'sa bit like you, Central America and Cuba. In human and geographicterms, it's very close to -- to my country.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, then let me ask you, though. Now, then, are youon the side of the rebels? Is this the -- you know, making the rebelswin, is that the aim of this current military operation?\n\nARAUD: We -- we do consider France as recognized -- thecommittee of Benghazi as the representative of the Libyan people. Wesimply want the Libyan people able to express their -- their will.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Aujali. You've heardAdmiral Mullen clearly said the mission is to protect the citizens ofBenghazi and -- and Libya and to open up humanitarian ability forthem, not to take out Gadhafi, not to support the opposition. What doyou understand by this resolution?\n\nAUJALI: I understand the mission is to protect the Libyancivilians, not only Benghazi. Protection of the Libyan civilian onlyachieved by one goal, that Gadhafi is not there, not only by stop hisairplanes striking the people. The dangers is Gadhafi himself.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you understand, this military action is aimed toget rid of Gadhafi?\n\nAUJALI: Of course. If this is not the mission, then they wouldjust hit some airplane -- shot the airplanes down and then leave wasthis madman, killing his people without mercy. This is...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you, Ambassador Araud. Is that theaim? Is that what the United States, France, and Britain have signedup to, to get rid of Colonel Gadhafi?\n\nARAUD: We want the Libyan people to be able to express theirwill, I've said, which -- and we consider that it means that Gadhafihas to go.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you concerned -- are you concerned that there willbe retaliation? You've taken on this -- this military intervention.He has threatened retaliation against France, Britain, the UnitedStates, or at least their interests. Are you worried?\n\nARAUD: You know, when you enter a military intervention, it'snever risk-free. So we have to be careful and to consider all thedangers. But, also, we know that Gadhafi is prone to empty rhetoric.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Let me ask you one final question,Ambassador Aujali. This is designed to divide and conquer, to getGadhafi's people away from him. You defected. Do you think thatothers around him will defect?\n\nAUJALI: Believe me, the people who are around him, especiallythe ministers, if they have a chance to defect, they will do it now,now, now. But he kept them -- he's keeping them in the Bab al-Azizia.They have no place to go...\n\nAMANPOUR: In his compound?\n\nAUJALI: In his compound. Then he's using them as a -- as ahuman shelter, also. But if they have a chance, they will defect.For example, I give you example, if you have some time. Then -- Ihave a friend of mine who was appointed the ambassador to Geneva.He's a young man, first time he's been appointed the head of mission.And when he left Tripoli with his credential, he just resigned.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Well, we'll see what happens, whether thepeople around Gadhafi turn against him. Ambassador Araud in New York,thank you for joining us.\n\nAmbassador Aujali, thank you for joining us.\n\nAnd when we return, the big question: How -- now that the U.S.has struck at Libya, will Libya strike back? I'll discuss that with ahigh-powered roundtable that includes the former chair of the HouseIntelligence Committee and an architect of the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd later, we turn to the week's other major story, danger anddevastation in Japan, as that country struggles to avert a full-scalenuclear meltdown. I'll ask former Energy Secretary Bill Richardsonand former Homeland Secretary Chief Michael Chertoff whether Americais prepared to manage such a catastrophe.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Actions have consequences, and the writ of theinternational community must be enforced. Today we are part of abroad coalition, we are answering the calls of a threatened people,and we are acting in the interests of the United States and the world.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: President Obama right there -- excuse me -- explainingwhy American missiles and allied air strikes are now raining down onLibya, emphasizing that this is a broad international effort. Asnoteworthy as what the president said yesterday is what he left out,namely, his recent declaration that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi mustgo.\n\nThis is a momentous time in America's relations with the Arabworld. And joining he today to discuss its far-reaching implications,ABC's George Will, former Congresswoman Jane Harman, who chaired theHouse Intelligence Committee, Paul Wolfowitz, former deputy secretaryof defense under George W. Bush and a mastermind of the war in Iraq,and Robin Wright of the U.S. Institute of Peace, author of \"Rock theCasbah: Rage and Rebellion Across the Islamic World.\"\n\nThank you all for joining me. And let me ask you first, George,do you think that this was the right thing to do?\n\nWILL: I do not. We have intervened in a tribal society in acivil war. And we have taken sides in that civil war on behalf ofpeople we do not know or understand for the purpose -- not avowed, butinexorably our purpose -- of creating a political vacuum bydecapitating that government. Into that vacuum, what will flow? Wedo not know and cannot know.\n\nAMANPOUR: Paul Wolfowitz, you disagree with George?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: I do. I think that what we have prevented, for onething, is a bloodbath in Benghazi, which would have stained ourreputation throughout the Arab world, at a time when our reputationreally matters. And I understand George's hesitations, but it wouldseem to me, if you follow those hesitations, you say, it's better tokeep this devil that we know than the unknown, and I don't see how anyunknown could be worse than the devil who is in Tripoli right now. AMANPOUR: Except wouldn't you say the hesitation -- you cantrace it right back to your operation in Iraq, that, you know, itcaused such a pendulum swing against trying to intervene because ofthe chaos that was unleashed.\n\nWOLFOWITZ: We have paid the price of intervention. Sometimeswe've paid the price of nonintervention, in Bosnia, for example. Oneof the things that makes the situation so unique is the monstrousquality of the Tripoli regime, the monstrous quality of Gadhafi andhis sons. And I know, you know, people say, well, what about Bahrain?What about Yemen? This is a totally different case, where a man isactually slaughtering his own people, has no regard for his ownpeople. He uses mercenaries to kill them. It is a unique case, andit's being watched throughout the Arab world.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you, former congresswoman. You saton the Intelligence Committee. You -- I mean, this question about whyLibya and not Bahrain or -- or Yemen, American allies, is that a validdistinction to make?\n\nHARMAN: I think it is. First, let me salute the life andservice of Warren Christopher, a dear friend from California, who diedyesterday and say how honored I am now to be president and CEO of theWoodrow Wilson Center, succeeding Lee Hamilton, and working withscholars like Robin and Aaron David Miller and others.\n\nI think we have to see this in a broader context. I just watchedyour Mike Mullen interview, where he said we -- we view each of thesecountries individually. We need a strategic narrative.\n\nAnd as I look at this, from my experience being in Congress whenwe did nothing in Rwanda, which Bill Clinton said was his biggestmistake, when we intervened in -- in Bosnia, did a no-fly zone, whichdidn't prevent the -- the massacre at Srebrenica, when we -- whenCongress acted in Afghanistan, the authorization to use military forceis still in effect, and then we took our eye off the ball, when wewent into Iraq, I voted for that, because I believed the intelligence,which turned out to be wrong, I see lessons to be learned, and I'm notsure we're learning all the lessons.\n\nAs I look at it, the biggest threats to the United States, to ourhomeland security, are Yemen and some of the Al Qaida and other terrorcells in Pakistan. Going into Libya has a moral objective, and Istrongly agree with that. And I also think that Hillary Clinton andSusan Rice, who were strong proponents of what we're doing here, aregreat public servants.\n\nBut we have to understand that just a no-fly zone here may notcause regime change. And if we have a cornered Moammar Gadhafi -- whois not a rational actor -- and he uses mustard gas against his people,how have we...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, actually -- Admiral Mullen...\n\nHARMAN: ... how have we prevented that?\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen said that there wasn't a huge amount ofthreat there.\n\nHARMAN: There are two tons of liquefied mustard gas in Libya.\n\nAMANPOUR: Yeah, but he said he hasn't seen any movement of that.\n\nHARMAN: Not yet. We've only been there for 24 hours.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think it's a threat?\n\nHARMAN: I worry about that. I mean, we can't take out mustardgas by air. If we blow it up, we disperse it. And I worry about aguy who's going to fight to the end -- and that's what we just heardfrom the former ambassador -- and is not a rational actor, doingthings like that, putting human shields around all the obvioustargets, including his own -- his own living quarters, and takingWesterners as hostages and possibly engaging in terror acts and goingdown with as much bloodshed as possible.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you. You've interviewed him; I'veinterviewed him. A lot of people have. Is he the crazy man thatRepresentative Harman talks about? Or is he going to either fold orbe turned on by his own people?\n\nWRIGHT: He could prolong this for a very long time. This is nota man who plays by international rules, nor is he a man who thinkslike even many of his counterparts in the Arab world, and that's why Ithink you've seen a great deal of unity in the Arab world against him.This is someone that everyone in Africa, in the Arab world...\n\nAMANPOUR: Which is really unusual, to have such a big Arabcoalition against a fellow Arab leader.\n\nWRIGHT: And we haven't had one like this since the Iraq war backin 1990-1991. And that's what's, in fact, given the internationalcommunity the legs. Without that, we probably would not be engaged.\n\nBut this is a very different kind of war. This is a countrythat's the size of Alaska with a population smaller than New YorkCity. And so when we talk about the -- the kind of scenarios down theroad, this is -- you know, most of the cities are along the coastalstrip -- that it may not be as complicated as a place like Iraq was.This is -- you know, there are obvious targets and obvious sequence ofplaces that either side will go. But there is mission gap betweensaying we want regime change and we're in there militarily forhumanitarian. And that's where the problem is.\n\nAMANPOUR: Should it be regime change?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: Look, I think one of the most important pieces that'smissing here is our connection with this transitional national councilin Benghazi. They are -- they have representatives from all over thecountry. They seem to be setting up rules that are respectable rules.\n\nAMANPOUR: Really? Are you convinced about that? Who are they?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: Well, I'm not convinced. Well, I think we shouldhave people in there so we really know better who they are. And weought to be thinking of them as a leading edge here. I think it'sbeen right to get an international coalition out in front and not makethis all American, but most of all, it's a Libyan fight. What's beenamazing over the last month is how brave the Libyan people have been.And I think -- across the whole country. this is not just a tribalthing in the east.\n\nAMANPOUR: But -- but when it comes, then, to lessons learned,what happens then with a Bahrain or a Yemen? I mean, isn't this adouble standard?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: Look, excuse me: Libya is a separate case all byitself. You cannot...\n\nAMANPOUR: It is or it isn't.\n\nWOLFOWITZ: No, no, you can't -- you can't compare the regime inBahrain or even the regime in Sana'a to Gadhafi. But, yes, there is acertain -- there's something in common here, which is that regimesthat don't represent their people are not only wrong, they'reultimately unstable. And I think what we should be working for inBahrain, what we should be working for in Yemen are governments thatare much more representative of their people so that we can work withthem better. But they're not -- it's absolutely wrong to comparewhat's happening there with what Gadhafi is -- is doing and has beendoing for 40 years.\n\nWILL: There is no limiting principle in what we've done. If weare to protect people who are under assault, then where people areunder assault in Bahrain, we are logically -- not only logicallycommitted to help them, we are inciting them to rise in expectation.The mission creep here began, Paul, before the mission began, becausewe had a means not suited to the end. The means is a no-fly zone.That will not affect the end, which is obviously regime change.\n\nWRIGHT: Look, Yemen and Bahrain have the same problem that we doin Libya. Forty-five people were killed by the regime in Yemen,peaceful protests on Friday. You have the same thing in Bahrain.\n\nThis is -- the Obama administration has been responding veryslowly at the outset to this kind of colossal transformation in theArab world, and it's finally begun to kind of -- in response to what'shappened in Tunisia, then in Egypt, and now in Libya, but it -- todevelop a strategy, but it doesn't have a policy across the regionthat is consistent. And I think it's going to catch us at some point.\n\nHARMAN: Two points. I agree with that. We don't have asecurity narrative across the world. And we absolutely need that,because these countries are connected to each other. One fruit vendorwho immolates himself in the boonies in Tunisia has set off afirestorm, an earthquake -- let's use Japan as the metaphor -- acrossthe region.\n\nTwo points about this. One, Congress. The leaders of Congresswere briefed last Friday at the -- in the Situation Room. Many werepart of the recess and weren't there. That is not, by my lights,briefing Congress. Congress needs to be called back and discuss thisand authorize or limit...\n\nAMANPOUR: Isn't it too late?\n\nHARMAN: ... the mission. No, I think the president is lawfullyacting under his emergency powers as commander-in-chief and the U.N.resolution. And we didn't ask Congress to approve Bosnia. But Ithink Congress needs to act.\n\nThe other thing is, this is a zero-sum game militarily. We arestretched to the limit. And the assets we put into Libya we aretaking away from somewhere else. And it's not just warships, people,and money. It's brain cells.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Let me then ask you -- since you've justsaid that, last lightning round then. Is this, as the president said,in the U.S. national interest?\n\nWILL: It is not worth war.\n\nAMANPOUR: U.S. national interest?\n\nHARMAN: It is not as direct a threat to us as Yemen andPakistan.\n\nAMANPOUR: U.S. national interests?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: I think, if Gadhafi were to survive, it would be verymuch against American interest, very seriously so.\n\nWRIGHT: We were within 24 hours probably of losing Benghazi,which would have been losing Libya. So you have to ask yourself, howimportant is Libya to the broader scheme of things? And it had becomethe new model. After peaceful transitions in Egypt and Tunisia, youbegan to see a new model in Libya and the use of force, and that'swhere it became dangerous.\n\nAMANPOUR: So within 24 hours, was it a desperation move, then?\n\nWRIGHT: I think that we were very close to the point of notbeing able to intervene at all, because it would have become Gadhafi'sbaby -- his country again.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, certainly everybody is going to be watching thisand keeping a very close eye. Thank you all very much, indeed.\n\nAnd when we return, the other story making global headlines thisweek, the disaster in the Pacific. The nuclear crisis in Japan raisesa disturbing question: What if it happened here? Could it? Is theUnited States prepared to respond to a full-scale nuclear meltdown?I'll ask the man who coordinated the federal response to a host ofnational disasters, former Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff.He'll join me. And so will Bill Richardson, who's grappled withissues of nuclear safety as diplomat, energy secretary, and governorof New Mexico. I'll ask them whether the U.S. should be ready for apossible terrorist attack sponsored by Moammar Gadhafi.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: In Japan today, workers at the Fukushima nuclear powerplant are struggling to contain radiation, as fears of contaminationspread across the country. Officials abandoned a plan to release moreradioactive gasses into the air to relieve pressure at the crippledreactor. And the government announced the plant itself would bescrapped once the emergency is resolved.\n\nAnd this troubling news: Higher than normal levels of radiationhas been found in spinach and milk. That's been detected from farmsabout 90 miles from the reactor.\n\nThe harrowing images we've seen day after day have many Americansasking one question: Could it happen here?\n\nThere are 104 nuclear reactors scattered around the country insome 31 states. At least a dozen are in areas at moderate to highrisk of an earthquake. So what happens if a natural disaster sets offa catastrophic domino effect here in America? Is the governmentprepared to respond?\n\nJoining me now to answer that question, Michael Chertoff, whoserved as secretary of homeland security in the Bush administration,and he's also chairman of the Chertoff Group. And with us, BillRichardson, who wears many hats. He was Bill Clinton's energysecretary and ambassador to the United Nations and most recentlyserved as governor of New Mexico.\n\nGentlemen, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nJust before we get to the crucial issue of Japan and nuclearenergy, let me ask you regarding Gadhafi's threats and the possibilityof terrorism. Your job was to protect the homeland here. Do youthink there's an increased risk now with this military activity overLibya?\n\nCHERTOFF: I think you have to assume there's an increased risk inthe sense that Gadhafi is a proven terrorist, and it's wise to assumethat he's got the intent at some point to do something to retaliate.\n\nBut I think his capability has been much degraded. For onething, we have raised the level of our protection and our securityover the years. I think his capability in the U.S. is not that great.If this operates today as it did when I was in office, we already haveunfolded a plan to track all of his operatives in the United Statesand to make sure they're not in a position to do something. So...\n\nAMANPOUR: So you're really prepared here for that?\n\nCHERTOFF: I think we are prepared for this, but, again, theimportant thing is to continue to watch him not only here in the U.S.,but look at American interests overseas, including people who aretraveling or people who may be living overseas, as well.\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, his son said, no, that's not our target, whenI asked him about retaliation. I mean...\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, you know, he's like a cornered rat. And acornered rat will do whatever it has to do in order to defend itselfor to strike back. So while right now my suspicion is they have theirhands full, it's certainly something -- it's prudent to consider thathe may seek to divert attention or even to push back by strikingsomeplace else.\n\nBut, again, his capability now is not what it was 10 years ago.And more importantly, we've got a much more robust security apparatus.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Governor Richardson, do you think that the U.S.is more at risk?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, I don't want to be an alarmist. And I agreewith what the secretary said. But he's a very unpredictable -- he'salmost a wild man right now. He's cornered. My concern is, does hehave any chemical weapons? I am concerned about these mustard gasreports.\n\nAMANPOUR: We asked Admiral Mullen about that.\n\nRICHARDSON: No, I know what he said, but my concern is, thereare some allegations that he was directly responsible for Lockerbie.My concern is, Americans in the Mediterranean flying I think should beextra cautious.\n\nI don't want to be an alarmist, but when a man is cornered who isdesperate, who wants to cling on to power, who sees his basenarrowing, who is attacked, could be capable, as he has in the past,very horrendous things.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's turn to the other major, major story, thispotential cataclysmic meltdown. Is there -- is the United Statestotally prepared to handle something like that? Could that happenhere?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, let's -- let's define what we mean by handle.If you had a -- an earthquake that resulted in serious damage,devastating damage to a nuclear power plant -- and I'm saying thatthat would happen -- it would be a very ugly situation.\n\nThe critical issue would be to evacuate people in a timelyfashion. Now, as part of the process of putting these plans in and aspart of our general planning process, we have worked to developevacuation plans. But make no mistake: They have to be drilled.They have to be exercised. And if that hasn't been done, it's goingto become a challenge.\n\nAMANPOUR: Has it been done?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, I think it varies. I mean, if you look atCalifornia, they tend to be very good about the process ofpreparation. Other states may not be quite as intense about it.\n\nThe thing to remember is this, though: No matter how good youare, it's going to be very difficult. And the way to minimize thedifficulty is to have people be self-reliant, to have them wellprepared, to make sure they're educated so they can take their ownactions to get out of the way if, in fact, it looks like we're goingto have a problem.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Governor, you were governor of New Mexico whenSecretary Chertoff was in office. To your mind, is the federalgovernment prepared if it happened somewhere near your state?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, I can tell you that states generally are notprepared. And so we rely on the federal government. And -- and Ibelieve the secretary's right. The federal government has to lead.\n\nI think the big message here is -- from -- from the Japanesecrisis is that we're looking at what happened in the oil spill, whathappened with the mining disaster in West Virginia, the pipelineexplosion. We have to look at the safety, cost, environmental risksof all our energy production. And I think the message with thenuclear reactors in Japan is that we should look at all our 104reactors in the United States for their safety and preparedness withinNRC.\n\nAMANPOUR: And when you were governor -- you were saying thestates aren't prepared -- but did you believe that the federalgovernment was prepared?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, I think this tragedy in Japan indicates thatwe need to be better prepared, that...\n\nAMANPOUR: So is that a yes or a no?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, I think -- I think, again, Christiane, you haveto have a realistic expectation. I think the federal government is --has a general plan for catastrophic incidents. I think there arecapabilities that could be deployed.\n\nBut recognizing, the initial hours after any kind of catastrophe,the government is not going to rescue everybody. That's not possible.And part of what I used to say and what Secretary Napolitano is sayingis, preparation begins at the home and at the business level.\n\nAnd that means, if you're in an area which is earthquake-prone,you've got to have a plan in place to evacuate if necessary, or you'vegot to know how to shelter yourself. Now, there's going to be a bigexercise in May, in the central part of the country, the New Madridearthquake fault, which we put in process several years ago. Andthat's a great opportunity for communities to take a -- a second lookat their plans and make sure they're really serious and well-prepared.\n\nAMANPOUR: So what scares you most as a former governor andhaving to rely on the federal government for this kind of rescue?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, first of all, we need to have evacuationplans. I don't think we have adequate ones around the country.\n\nSecondly, we have to look at licensing of new nuclear powerplants. The president wants to proceed with 20 in the next decade.We want to have loan guarantees. But I think we have to have atimeout on nuclear power.\n\nAMANPOUR: So is that -- a timeout?\n\nRICHARDSON: A timeout, not -- not a moratorium, a timeout,review the safety and cost of all these plants, with the new licensingplants. Let's look at those that are being proposed in earthquake-prone areas. Let's look at those that are in seismic -- where there'sintensive seismic material.\n\nAnd then, lastly, look at the ones -- and there's about a thirdof our nuclear plants that have some of this Japanese technology thatobviously has not worked. And I think internationally we have to havesome leadership in the whole range of the coolants in these reactors,the spent fuel. We have to look at ways that the internationalcommunity, the international atomic energy commission looks at waysthat there can be standardized safety procedures.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think there needs to be a timeout?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, I -- I agree with Bill, we need to obviouslylook at the lessons learned from what's happened in Japan. But what Iwould caution against is overreacting, even to this catastrophicevent.\n\nYou know, we had a problem with BP in the gulf, and the reactionwas, we can't drill in the gulf. We have problems with other forms ofenergy, and people say, well, we shouldn't do that.\n\nWell, you know, at the end of the day, if we don't use coal, oil,natural gas, or nuclear, we're going to be sitting around the firetrying to warm ourselves like we did eons ago.\n\nSo we're going to have to manage risk. That doesn't meanguaranteeing against any -- it means having in place ways to mitigateproblems. And that's where I think the lessons of Japan can be very,very helpful.\n\nRICHARDSON: And I think the lesson, also, for America is, wehave to look at renewable energy, natural gas, clean sources, butreassess our entire safety procedures when it comes to our fossilfuels. When it -- look what happened in -- in the gulf. Look whathappened in these mining disasters. A new conversation about safety,cost, and environmental risk of our energy production.\n\nAMANPOUR: A new conversation, indeed. Thank you both very muchfor joining us. Secretary Chertoff, Governor Richardson, thank youfor coming in.\n\nAnd we'll have a final thought when we come back. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: A week ago, I was in Japan. This program wasbroadcast out of there after we were covering the aftermath of theterrible earthquake and tsunami. And with me, a team of ABCcorrespondents, reporting on all the aspects of the unfolding tragedy,including the nuclear accident.\n\nWhen we returned to the United States, we gathered to discuss thestories that we all didn't get a chance to report on the air. And youcan find that conversation at abcnews.com, where you can always getthe latest developments on Japan and Libya. And, of course, \"WorldNews with David Muir\" will have a full wrap of the day's events. AndABC will have all the news across all the platforms.\n\nThank you for watching \"This Week,\" and I'll see you again nextSunday.",

Federal agencies must prioritize aid to the states struggling the most, and West Virginia must be at the very top of the list. President Trump unveiled his opioid response plan this week, and it is time for Congress to pass my legislation to make sure that West Virginia and other states hardest hit by the drug crisis get the resources they need to truly make an impact in combating this epidemic. We must to everything possible to help people in need find recovery and stop the flood of opioids and other drugs into our communities,\u201d Rep. Jenkins said.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan legislation signed into law in 2016, included $1 billion in funding to address the drug crisis. In distributing these funds, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration relied on a funding formula that benefited states with larger populations.\n\nThe Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act, introduced by Jenkins and Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), would make clear that per capita overdose deaths should be a part of the formula used to distribute 21st Century Cures Act funding. The introduction of this bill followed an announcement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and SAMHSA that there would be no change in the funding formula for the distribution of opioid State Targeted Response grants.",

We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.\n\nThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.",

    "text":"Expanding Opportunity \u2014 #KempForum16 Paul Ryan \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Jan 9, 2016 5 min read -- 8 Listen Share\n\nLet\u2019s get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.\n\nI just wanted to say a few words about why we\u2019re here today. And one reason why I\u2019m here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.\n\nSo I couldn\u2019t think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.\n\nWe\u2019ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I don\u2019t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you\u2019re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we haven\u2019t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty \u2014 that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem?\n\nIt is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation \u2014 or not having enough money.\n\nWe treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, we\u2019ve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in people\u2019s budgets: health care,child care, energy, education \u2014 with almost no coordination among them.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you don\u2019t make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.\n\nAnd because we\u2019ve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and you\u2019ll lose a ton. So we think we\u2019ve been filling holes. But we\u2019ve actually been building a trap. And that\u2019s because poverty is about more than deprivation; it\u2019s about isolation.\n\nThere are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They don\u2019t have the support they need to grow, whether it\u2019s a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.\n\nWhat they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Don\u2019t just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.\n\nDon\u2019t measure success based on inputs. Measure the results.\n\nAnd this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington.\n\nIt is the people in our communities \u2014 the people with credibility. They\u2019re the ones who can break through. And I\u2019m not saying just cut money for the safety net. I\u2019d say spend the same amount of money we do now \u2014 because this isn\u2019t about saving money; it\u2019s about saving lives.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, don\u2019t minimize; customize. Take the money we\u2019re spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each person\u2019s needs. And whatever you do,encourage work \u2014 because that\u2019s how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow.\n\nThey\u2019ll not only have enough money; they\u2019ll be able to make enough money to get off assistance.\n\nThe way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities \u2014 they\u2019re the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines.\n\nNow, I know a lot of people are wondering, \u201cWhy do you care about this? You\u2019re Republicans.\u201d\n\nI remind them, \u2018Well, we\u2019re Americans too.\u2019 We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesn\u2019t determine the outcome of your life.\n\nIf you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself.\n\nBut a lot of people don\u2019t think that\u2019s true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not enough to pay your taxes and think, \u201cGovernment is going to take care of this.\u201d We all have to get involved.\n\nAnd I know it\u2019s easy to get discouraged. But what I\u2019ve learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; they\u2019re already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not they\u2019re right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.\n\nSo I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America.",

    "text":"MR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, a new year and new challenges for the president and Republicans as the 112th Congress convenes this week. Can both sides compromise on such tough issues as jobs, the debt, and the deficit? Or does 2011 promise to be a year of gridlock and posturing in advance of the 2012 presidential race? Our lead-in interview this morning, the senior Republican Senator from South Carolina , member of the Armed Services Committee , Lindsey Graham . Then, our roundtable with the political forecast for this new year. How does President Obama try to rebound from the pitfalls of 2010 ? What is the future of the GOP with tea partiers in Congress and an unsettled presidential field taking shape? What are the prospects for economic recovery in the new year? And snow politics. Tough questions for the politicians when a white Christmas goes wrong. With us, columnist David Brooks of The New York Times ; and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post ; Washington correspondent for the BBC , Katty Kay ; Senator - elect from Pennsylvania , Republican Pat Toomey ; and author of the new book \"The Violence of Peace ,\" Yale law professor Stephen Carter .\n\nAnnouncer: From NBC News in Washington , MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Good morning. A new year and a renewed focus on the economy as the president makes a pledge to the American people in his weekly address this weekend. His new year's resolution? Getting the economy back on track.\n\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA: As President, that's my commitment to you, to do everything I can to make sure our economy is growing, creating jobs, and strengthening our middle class . That's my resolution for the coming year.\n\nMR. GREGORY: The president returns from his family holiday in Hawaii on Tuesday, and the 112th Congress with a Republican House and a more closely divided Democratic Senate convenes on Wednesday. Here with us this morning, a leading Republican in the Senate , the senior senator from South Carolina , Lindsey Graham . Happy new year , Senator , welcome back to MEET THE PRESS .\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you for having me. Happy new year .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So the president talks about a new year's resolution to get the economy back on track. He will face a more Republican Congress . Will he find a partner in the new Congress with more Republicans there?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I hope so. I -- well, why did the economy get off track? The policies the president has pursued over the last couple of years with his Democratic colleagues -- the stimulus bill, Obama health care -- I think has made economic recovery more difficult. He'll find a partner if he'll come our way when it comes to creating jobs and controlling spending. The mandate of the last election was pretty clear to me that the Democratic policies from 2008 to '10 were rejected by the American people because they created too much debt and they grew the government too much. So if you want to reduce the size of government , I think you'll find a willing partner in the Republicans .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, where do you see the economy right now? You know, holiday spending was pretty good in terms of shopping. But you look at the housing market , it's still a mess.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Prices coming down, interest rates going up.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you think economic recovery is still going to be stalled?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I think what got us into this mess was the collapse of housing , and it's very -- some bad numbers came out recently about housing . The one thing with extending the tax cuts for two years helped a bit, but the Obama health care is a real burden to small businesses and large businesses. There's been 200 and something waivers. I think one of the best things Republicans do to help the economy is give business certainty, really go after, hard, the Obama healthcare bill, redesign the stimulus bill to make sure it goes to the economy , not to the government . I think it's going to be a, a slow recovery . And 2011 will be a continuation of 2010 , probably unemployment still above nine percent.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me break that down a little bit. You mentioned housing . You know, back in 2008 , Republicans , including Senator McCain and yourself...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...were talking about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the big housing giants...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yes. Right, right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...that now the government took over as being responsible for the crisis. That's a debatable point. But they now basically support the housing market in this country . Are you with the same Republicans , including your own views, that those should be wound down and privatized?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, they should certainly be reviewed and reformed because they pushed mortgages out to people who couldn't pay their mortgages. The mortgages became exotic, security interests -- instruments sold all over the world . And the financial regulation bill really left unattended Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . And when you have government entities this large who own this much of housing , who've been pushing mortgages on people who can't afford to pay them, and you do nothing about it, it's pretty hard for me to say you've reformed the, the problem that got us into this mess. So yes.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, what's the Republican solution? But what's the Republican solution to housing ?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: To me, is to get Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a, in a more privatized environment where risk\/reward is, is, is more traditionally accepted. That -- the American dream is to own a home you can afford. And to look at these entities and get more private sector involvement and control who they lend money to and basically wind them down and make them more private.\n\nMR. GREGORY: OK. Let me move on to health care , which you also raised. Is there a chance for actual healthcare repeal, or do you see room for compromise ? All this talk about the individual mandate making individuals buy insurance...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...you had talked about compromise on that early on.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you disagree that it's unconstitutional? A lot of Republicans believe that.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I think the problem with the individual mandate is that everybody's going to be in a government -run plan. I was with seven Republicans and seven Democrats that required everybody to be covered. You did away with employer deductions and you allowed individuals to buy health care in the private sector across state lines and it was revenue neutral. I think you're going to see the fight on Obamacare across the board in the House and the Senate to try to defund the Obamacare bill and to start over. One thing I'm going to do with Senator Barrasso is allow states to opt out of the individual mandate, the employer mandate, and expansion of Medicaid . The expansion of Medicaid under the Obama healthcare bill is going to bankrupt South Carolina . So I think this fight is going to continue to 2012 and it's going to move from Washington to the States . It will be one big fight over the role of health care and should Obama health care be in existence in 2012 the way it is today.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator , we talk about what kind of a relationship this White House is going to have with a more Republican Congress or a Republican House ...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...more Republicans in the Senate . The lame-duck session was where the president finished pretty strong, a lot of bipartisan accomplishment. This is what you said, however, just before Christmas , reacting to the lame duck. You weren't very pleased. Let's listen.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: When it's all going to be said and done, Harry Reid has eaten our lunch. This has been a capitulation in two weeks of dramatic proportions of policies that wouldn't have passed in the new Congress .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So to your way of thinking...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...the kind of bipartisanship we saw is not what you want to see in the new year?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. I don't want to see bills passed in a lame-duck Congress where you can't amend the bill. \"Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell\" was repealed in the lame-duck Congress . No one- -not one amendment was allowed to the bill. We had six versions of the Dream Act brought up in the lame-duck Congress ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: That's the immigration bill .\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: ...to make political points. Yeah, that's right. The START treaty could've been made better if it came into the new year. I don't understand why Republicans were pushing through policies in the lame duck that could've been made better in the new Congress . But it's not about us and the president, it's about us and the American people . Will the Republican Party learn from the mistakes of the Democratic Party ? If in 2012 we can show the American people we spent less of their money , we went to the heart of our debt problem by reforming entitlements, and we reduced the size of government , I think we will fare well with the American people . If we don't do those things, we're going to be in trouble ourselves.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, you've talked about the tea party influence, and you've been skeptical about whether tea party activists who become candidates who become legislators now are actually willing to compromise , actually willing to legislate. Where do you find yourself then?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well, I...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Closer to the tea party after the lame-duck session or closer to the moderates?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well, I hope I'm, I'm enthusiastic about new people coming in because God knows this Congress coming into being needs to learn from the mistakes of the past Congress . So tea party people could provide energy to do something about our spending problems by getting us back to 2008 spending levels. Pat Toomey 's on your panel. He's been a real leader on entitlement reform . The debt commission is a bipartisan document that we all should look at about flattening our tax code , increasing the age eligibility for Medicare and Social Security , upper income Americans should have their Social Security benefits means tested simply because we don't have enough money to keep Social Security solvent without change . So I hope the tea party will come to Washington and change the whole dynamic that led to this fiscal mess we're in, starting with spending in the 2011 year, but also in reforming entitlements. And I think a guy like Pat Toomey will be a breath of fresh air for the, for the next Congress .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me break a few of those things down because it's an important level of detail . But let me start with this.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You talk about the budget , you talk about spending. How will you vote on the debt ceiling ? Will you vote to raise it? Which is, which is a vote that'll come up in relatively short order.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right. Well, to not raise the debt ceiling could be a default of the United States' bond and Treasury obligations. That would be very bad for, for the position of the United States in the world at large . But this is an opportunity to make sure the government is changing its spending ways. I will not vote for the debt ceiling increase until I see a plan in place that will deal with our long-term debt obligations, starting with Social Security , a real bipartisan effort to make sure that Social Security stays solvent, adjusting the age, looking at means tests for benefits. On the spending side, I'm not going to vote for debt ceiling increase unless we go back to 2008 spending levels, cutting discretionary spending .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, but let me stop you for a second, Senator .\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I think it's an opportunity ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: That's a big condition...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yes.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...just on Social Security alone.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, it is.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you think Republicans are prepared to follow you in two things you said: Raise the retirement age , and means test benefits for older Americans ?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I would suggest that if we're serious about taking America in a new direction, and you're not putting entitlement reform on the table, you've missed a great opportunity to change the course of America 's future. And the last election was about change , Change that really will make us something other than Greece . I think Pat Toomey , Rand Paul , and other candidates who are new to the Congress have said during the campaign, \"Everything's on the table when it comes to making America fiscally sound.\" Let's see if we can find bipartisan reforms in Social Security before we raise the debt limit.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But do you think Senator McConnell , the, the leader of the Republicans , is going to go along with that?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I hope so. I know that Speaker Boehner is going to produce spending limitation bills every day. But the question for the Republican Party , for the tea party , for the Democratic Party , beyond discretionary spending , are we willing to look at the debt commission's suggestions in entitlement reform and begin to enact those reforms before it's too late? I hope the -- that, that this new Congress will do something the other Congresses have never done, and that is seriously look at entitlement reform by adjusting the age and means assessing benefits, including Medicare Part D. Obama health care needs to be repealed and replaced. But the Republican Party created Medicare Part D , a prescription drug entitlement that's already gotten out of control . I hope we'll put that on the table for reform .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Would you vote, would you vote to actually scrap that, to take it away?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I would vote to means test it. I would vote to make sure that people in my income level and your income level don't get their benefits, prescription drug bills paid by the federal government because we can't afford it. I would vote to make sure that someone in my income level would have their Social Security benefits renegotiated if they're under 55, not in a Draconian way but changes that we can make now for people 55 and under to avoid a fiscal collapse that's surely coming if we do nothing. The president said in his speech he wants to work with us. This is a good opportunity to find common ground; entitlement reform starting with Social Security .\n\nMR. GREGORY: You talked about the president, his leadership style and your own assessment of him. I want to put up on the screen something you said to the National Review last month. \"President,\" -- this is about the government shutdown , but what you talked about was President Obama and his experience. And you said, \"I think he's adrift. His instincts, I think, are to be more centrist, since that's the political future for him. But he doesn't feel comfortable taking on his own party . And he sure doesn't know how to cut a deal and sell it. That goes back to experience.\"\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"He's never done this stuff before. I hope the message is, before you elect someone president of the United States , the more experience they have in the real world , the better. He's never sat down with a group of Republicans and Democrats hard-headed right and hard-headed left and hammered out a deal.\" You don't think what happened in the lame-duck session qualifies?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well, what happened in the lame-duck session was that you had policies that were passed that were sort of liberal agenda policies that got votes or passed that really didn't change the job situation. The president did agree to an extension of the tax cuts , but his initial entry into the agreement was whining. He accused us Republicans of being hostage takers, but he did change . When President Clinton was allowed to talk about the tax extension deal, I think that was a moment of change for President Obama . I hope he will continue to embrace the middle when it comes to spending and entitlement reform .\n\nMR. GREGORY: What about spending and the budget ? Back in '95 you defended a decision to, to shut down the government . You said nobody was angry about that. You held to principle.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you think it would be a mistake for Republicans to pursue that path this time?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I think it's smart for Republicans to learn from our mistakes. At the end of the day , the American people do not like the direction that the, the country has been taking the\n\nlast two years. We have a chance to go a new way: Control spending, do something about long-term entitlements. You don't need to shut the government down to accomplish those goals, but you need to lead. And at the end of the day , will the Republican Party , with this new lease on life, lead? Will we put a budget together? Will Paul Ryan put a budget together that not only starts reducing the deficit but addresses long-term debt? I think he will. I'm optimistic about the new members of the Republican Party coming in to the House and the Senate . I think we got a second chance on life, and we're going to take full advantage it. And to my Democratic friends out there, if you want to do something about spending and debt, you're going to find willing partners on the Republican side , but it has to be meaningful change .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Final area, with just a, just a moment left. I want to talk about Afghanistan . You've traveled there extensively and you think a lot about the war. Vice President Biden was on this program in the last couple of weeks...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...was emphatic in talking about the endgame for the United States . This is a portion of what he said.\n\nVICE PRES. JOE BIDEN: At the recent Lisbon conference, the NATO conference where we said we're starting this process, just like we did in Iraq . We're starting it in July of 2011 , and we're going to be totally out of there, come hell or high water , by 2014 .\n\nMR. GREGORY: If that holds, that means there's a level of confidence that the primary challenge can be overcome. Which to you is what?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well, at the end of the day , I think the vice president has walked back that statement. The president rightfully has said, \"We're going to start transitioning this year. By 2014 , the Afghan security forces will be in the lead.\" I want an enduring relationship with Afghanistan past 2014 , politically, economically, and militarily, so that country never goes back into the hands of the Taliban or al-Qaeda . The two words that will be talked about in 2011 with Afghanistan are \"corruption\" and \" Pakistan .\" I am hopeful the Pakistani army will be more bold in attacking safe havens across the border that lie in Pakistan . I hope the Karzai government will better address corruption. I hope we can find an enduring relationship with Afghanistan that will make sure that country never goes back in the hands of terrorists. And the idea of putting permanent military bases on the table in 2011 , I think would secure our national interest and tell the bad guys and the good guys we're not leaving, we're staying, in a responsible way if the Afghan people want us to stay.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But that's important. You believe a permanent U.S. military presence in Afghanistan is required in order to head off a potential failed state in the future?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I think it would be enormously beneficial to the region , as well as Afghanistan . We've had air bases all over the world . A couple of air bases in Afghanistan would allow the Afghan security forces an edge against the Taliban in perpetuity. It would be a signal to Pakistan that the Taliban are never going to come back in Afghanistan . They could change their behavior. It would be a signal to the whole region that Afghanistan is going to be a new and different place. And if the Afghan people want this relationship, they're going to have to earn it. But I hope they will seek a relationship with the United States of where we can have an enduring relationship, economic and militarily and politically. And a couple of air bases in Afghanistan will give us an edge militarily, give the Afghan security forces an edge militarily, to ensure that country never goes back into the hands of the Taliban , which would be a stabilizing event throughout the whole region . That has to be earned by the Afghan people , and it has to be requested by them.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Before I let you go, Senator , do you have a candidate yet for -- a Republican candidate in 2012 ?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, the most electable conservative.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Who do you think...\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Whoever that is.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Who, who's the leading contender in your mind?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Probably Romney . Mitt Romney has got his problems as a candidate, but so does everyone else. But it's a changing environment . And the one thing you got to prove to the people of South Carolina , not only that you're a conservative, but you can carry the day. That's why we need to be talking about immigration and energy policy as a party . What will we do to break $4 a gallon gas, foreign oil dependency? The one issue we haven't talked about that needs to be talked about is $4 a gallon gas is coming, and we've done nothing to become energy independent. And I want to work with the president and Republicans and Democrats to get a rational energy policy to break our dependency on foreign oil , to create jobs here in America from a renaissance and nuclear power , and try to clean up the air as a noble pursuit of the Republican Party .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, we'll start there and on immigration in our next conversation. Senator Graham , thank you, as always.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Thank you. Happy new year .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Thank you. And up next, a look at the challenges ahead for President Obama in 2011 . You've heard some of them. Will economic recovery be achievable? And will compromise or gridlock dominate the new Congress as both parties set the stage for the 2012 race for the White House ? Plus, the political fallout from last week's big snowfall. Our roundtable weighs in: New York Times columnist David Brooks ; from The Washington Post , E.J. Dionne ; Washington correspondent for the BBC , Katy Kay ; senator- elect from Pennsylvania , Republican Pat Toomey ; and author of \"The Violence of Peace ,\" Yale law professor Stephen Carter .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Coming up, our political roundtable weighs in on what 2011 will mean for the president and a new Congress . Plus, the political fallout from last week's snowstorm. Up next, after this brief commercial break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back, joined now by our roundtable : columnist from The New York Times , David Brooks ; from The Washington Post , columnist E.J. Dionne ; Brooks and Dionne , together again; author of the new book \"The Violence of Peace : America 's Wars in the Age of Obama ,\" Yale law professor Stephen Carter . Welcome. First time on the program.\n\nMR. STEPHEN CARTER: Thank you.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator - elect from Pennsylvania , the Republican Pat Toomey is here as well; and Washington correspondent for the BBC , Katty Kay . Welcome to all of you, and happy new year .\n\nSEN.-ELECT PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): Happy new year .\n\nMR. E.J. DIONNE: Happy new year .\n\nMR. DAVID BROOKS: Happy new year .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Lots to talk about. We're back, a strong showing for the president in the lame-duck session of Congress . Now it's a new year, a new Congress , and new challenges. David Brooks , you heard the president in his new year's address, he talked about his new year's resolution as getting the economy back on track. What does that mean? Too many people still out of work, economy recovery still too slow. Mixed signals. Holiday shopping was pretty robust, exceeding expectations, people buying a lot of Christmas gifts, spending a lot of money . That was good. But then you saw headlines like this in The Wall Street Journal , about housing , that issue I brought up with Senator Graham . This was the headline, \" Housing Recovery Stalls.\" You've got a fall in home prices , interest rates going higher, that, that bedrock of savings for so many Americans simply wiped away by the loss of housing values. So where does the president go from here to make the, the economy stronger?\n\nMR. BROOKS: You know, you talk to people inside the White House about what they're going to do in the State of the Union , which is the big event in the next two years, and it's all about growth . \"Are you going to cut deficit, guys?\" \"Well, we're going to make growth .\" So they want to make growth . The Republicans want to come in and restrain the cost of spending. And I 've become optimistic, or at least think there's like a 30 percent chance that something real can happen because both parties are right. Obama 's right that we need growth , we need the infrastructure spending, the energy research . The Republicans are right, we do need to control spending. And there's actually ways to put these things together. They're not contradictory. And if Obama , in the State of the Union says, \"OK, we're going to control spending, and I'm going to trade that for some growth measures,\" I actually think there's a decent chance we could not have the gridlock that a lot of people used to expect.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator - elect Toomey , you're here, you'll be part of this new class in the Senate . What will the president find? He said in that new year's message, \"Look, I'll, I'll accept your good ideas.\" you're a partner, which means you're a partner in being accountable, as well, for the economy .\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: Sure. Well, if we focus on the growth side -- and you know, the two big messages from my campaign were about restoring economic growth and the job creation that comes with it and getting spending under control . On the growth side, I think there's some areas where we can work with the president, some areas where it's going to be tough. One area where we certainly can is trade. I think the president's finally gotten where he's happy with the South Korean trade agreement. We certainly should get that done, get Colombia , get Panama done, and move on from there. I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines, but plenty of opportunities. Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now. We should lower the capital gains rate. We should have a territorial tax system , like the rest of the world does, so that we have a more competitive environment . Third thing I think we need to do, and this is going to be confrontational, is deal with the regulatory overreach. There are regulatory agencies trying to impose on our economy the things that Congress has rejected. I'm talking about regulating the Internet , I'm talking about some energy policy , I'm talking about the EPA . So Congress is going to push back on that, and obviously the president's not going to be too happy about that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: E.J., let's talk about the president's leadership overall. You wrote in your column something that caught my eye this past Thursday in terms of how people are feeling about the president. \"The energy in our politics has shifted rightward,\" you wrote, \"with an abruptness that was inconceivable in the final weeks of the 2008 campaign, when Barack Obama could call a rally and count on tens of thousands to materialize almost at an instant. \"If there is one thing the Obama White House most underestimates, it is the dispirited mood of its troops. This is not just about 'the left,' but more important, about Obama 's broader rank-and- file, who expected that he would usher in more change , enjoy more success in confronting his Republican opponents, and prove more skilled in shifting the nation 's political dialogue in a progressive direction.\" You think it's not in that direction now.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Well, I think you look at the election result, and the election result was what it was. And I think when you see organizing in our politics, the organizing during '06, '07, '08, was on the progressive side. In the last couple of years, it's clearly been on the conservative side. So they have a kind of initiative in our politics. Now, I think there's an enormous opening here because one of the jobs in a democratic country is to hold people in power accountable. For two years, we have held the president accountable. Democrats had all the power . Now, suddenly, Republicans control the House of Representatives , and they have more power in the Senate . And I think you're going to have a kind of accountability on the Republican side . What are they actually for? Senator - elect Ayotte in -- of New Hampshire ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMR. DIONNE: ...responding to the president, said, \"We have to stop spending money we don't have on programs that are not working.\" I don't know of no progressive who disagrees with that. What programs are not working? I hope progressives and the president challenge Republicans and say, \"All right, what about corporate subsidies, farm subsidies , oil subsidies?\" You know, a lot of conservatives say, \"We're for the free market . We're for,\" you know, \"for smaller government ,\" but then turn around and support all kinds of subsidies. They say, \"No, we need this one.\" Now, a good free marketeer like the Senator may join with some progressives and say, you know, \" Corporate socialism is a problem.\" And so I think there is an opening to raise new issues now that the Republicans have some power .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, Stephen Carter , let's talk more broadly. Something you write about in, in your book in the context of America 's wars, is also applicable here, and that is this concept of sacrifice . You know, the lame-duck session featured this bipartisan deal over taxes where it was still about giveaways. You keep in place the Bush tax cuts , you -- there's more stimulus for the economy , that's not the hard stuff . That's not what you say to the American people , \"We're taking this away.\"\n\nMR. CARTER: It's still true that democracy is the worst form of government , except all the others. And when you try to manage an economy in a system in which everything that happens is twisted immediately for partisan advantage, that you run the serious risk that whatever you do, in the end, is going to end up looking like a giveaway. We tend to focus a lot, we're focusing this conversation, on short-term problems . How to grow the economy this month, this year. That's natural. People's home values are declining. People are out of work. But we have long-term structural problems that are enormous. I think if we don't confront, for example, the serious problem of public pensions that are underfunded in an amount no one actually knows because they're not accounted for by ordinary accounting standards, we face very -- we face long- term problems that it's not clear we can afford. E.J. mentioned a moment ago, well, what problem -- where is it we don't have the money and we have bad policies . That's a good example. We don't have the money to pay the pensions that we promised. No one has the money , the federal government doesn't have the money . I don't know where it's going to come from, but the problems are sitting there greatly underfunded. Those are the sorts of structural problems we have to deal with on the long -- in the long-term, and I'm not sure we're ready to face those yet.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm . Katty Kay , there's just -- there's also the politics of the right, right now, and the cross currents in the Republican Party . And the senator- elect can speak to this as well. A lot of tea partiers feeling like, \"Hey, wait a minute. We just saw this lame-duck session . Did they miss the message of the election ? There's a lot of accommodation there, and you heard Senator Graham say it as well, that they didn't bargain for.\n\nMS. KATTY KAY: No, absolutely. You've had tea partiers already saying that \"We're disappointed with what Washington is doing,\" even since the election . And, of course, they're going to face now two new challenges on raising the debt ceiling and spending levels for the federal government , and it's going to be a test of tea party purity and of the new members that are coming in. Are they actually going to make the decisions that are unpopular with the American people ? I thought what you said, David , about you sacrifice ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMS. KAY: ...is, is a critical issue of this. You cannot have it all. You cannot balance the budget , give people large tax cuts , as we have just done, and carry on with the spending programs that you've had. And, you know, if you're not really going to address entitlements or the defense budget , then that's going to be tricky. And it's very interesting to hear the senator- elect saying that he would go far on that and Lindsey Graham putting his neck out and saying he would address entitlement .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMS. KAY: But a lot of Republicans wouldn't. You push them on what they would actually cut, and they're reluctant to do it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, Senator - elect , I mean, here, here's the thing. When Senator Graham says, \"I won't vote for the debt ceiling until there's agreement to deal with means testing Social Security and raising the retirement age ,\" is he really suggesting he's going to hold out for Republicans to do that? I mean, do you see the political will to do something that dramatic in the next couple of months before you have to cast that vote on whether to raise the debt ceiling ?\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: I'm not sure that it has to be that specific...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: ...but I think it has to be very, very meaningful, with teeth. My, my suggestion is that when we contemplate raising the debt limit, we do it in small increments and we do it periodically, and every time we do it, we make sure we get a major concession, concession in the direction of limiting spending so that we can get this fiscal train wreck under control . We are on a disastrous path, there's just no question about it. And so we need to take serious measures. And I , and I for one couldn't vote for an increase in the debt ceiling unless we are making really substantive progress on it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: David -- yeah.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Although it's really strange that we say we want sacrifice and we want to get the deficit under control , yet Congress in this lame duck just voted to add about -- almost $900 billion to the deficit. I think sacrifice is something legitimate to ask of all of us. We decided to wage two wars and cut taxes at the same time. And the only people really sacrificing are the men and women in uniform. But there are a lot of people out there who have sacrificed a lot in this recession. And so the instant you raise the word sacrifice , the question is, who are we going to ask that from? Who is it fair to ask that from?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well...\n\nMR. BROOKS: I...\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: Can I...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Go, go ahead, David .\n\nMR. BROOKS: Yeah. I, I think the Republican Party has changed from say '95 or even last couple years when they weren't willing to sacrifice . This is a Republican Party more dedicated to asking and to toughing -- talking about issues like entitlements, to really asking these kind of questions. And one of the issues that we're going to face just chronologically in the -- in, in February and March and April, Paul Ryan 's going to produce a budget that will have some serious budget cuts, and we will have a big debate over that. At the same time, states all around the country are going to be going quasi bankrupt. So we're going to have a huge debate about the size of government . And I think the Republican Party 's actually much more willing to ask for the joint sacrifice than they were, say, under Tom DeLay .\n\nMR. DIONNE: Except no tax increases.\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: I, I just, I think this is the wrong -- personally, I just think this is the wrong way to construct this discussion and, and focus so much on the sacrifice . Let's remember, for instance, that under the current tax rates for the first four years in which they were fully in effect, from '04 through '07 inclusive, total government and federal spending was just below 20 percent of GDP , revenue was 17.5 percent on average, and we had deficits that were just barely over two percent of GDP , and half of that time below two percent. This was not excruciating suffering that the American people were going through in these years. And yet with these rates, we had deficits that were really quite manageable. We can do this again. Secondly, earmarks. I mean, I said from the beginning of my campaign, \"I will not ask for earmarks. This is a corrupt system, this is broken, this is wasting money .\" And, and I got elected. I got almost no pushback on that issue. Now, some would say, \"Well, that means a great sacrifice .\" Right? Well, evidently I think the public understands this is what you need to do. And the last point, on the entitlement reform , nobody's talking about making it go away. We're talking about changing the structure. So, for instance, the kind of reform of Social Security that I've advocated, give younger workers the opportunity to accumulate savings.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Senator , but -- and, Stephen Carter , you speak to this. There's still so much focus on taxes. Valerie Jarrett was here last week saying the president wants to make the tax cut issue an issue in 2012 . Mitch McConnell saying, \"Yeah, bring it on. We want to have that debate in 2012 .\" We have a temporary truce here, but tax rates are still going to be a major debating ground. And again, we haven't taken anything away yet.\n\nMR. CARTER: Well, it's true. I don't want to say -- I, I think it's awkward to talk about asking for sacrifice . Government doesn't ask for sacrifice , government tells people to sacrifice . But putting that aside, I do think there's actually room for compromise even on the tax issue. I think that most economists would agree. Our corporate taxes are the highest in the world. Our capital gains taxes unusually high compared to our competitors. And capital is fluid, it flows over borders, it'll go where the rates are low. But our personal rates are relatively low compared to the rest of the world , and our tax base is shrinking. So it may be that the room for compromise is over time , not while the economy is still soft. As the economy strengthens, reducing corporate tax rates, reducing the capital gains tax rate, adding the tax base -- that is, taxing more people at, at a lower rate, the way the deficit commission wants to do that. Something like that, a compromise fashioned that way, I think, would help put our tax system in a rational, nonpartisan way.\n\nMS. KAY: That's what they're debating.\n\nMR. BROOKS: That's exactly what they're debating.\n\nMS. KAY: But the debate over the last few weeks suggests that there is such an allergy amongst Republicans to even discussing any kind of a tax increase that I wonder if there really is room for compromise on it. You know, compromise , when you poll people, they all say they want to compromise , or the majority of Americans say they want to compromise . When you push a little bit further, what they really mean is they want the other side to start agreeing with them. We heard Lindsey Graham saying exactly that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Can I get one thought in here? I want to ask one question to E.J. , where we began on the, on the president. You know, I still speak to liberals who feel this sense of betrayal in the sense they don't feel like the president has fought the fight that they expected he would fight. Yes, he had some gains there, but he's still been too reactive, has not been -- promised the kind of leadership -- or hasn't delivered the kind of leadership that he promised. What does he do to deal with that sense among his core supporters?\n\nMR. DIONNE: Well, I think there's a dysfunction between the president and his core supporters. He gets so impatient at people on the left, and there isn't a very big left in our country , who are doing their job, which is pushing him to test the limits of the possible. The left looks at him and doesn't sort of -- focuses so much on what wasn't done, like the public option, that it -- in health care -- that it forgets that, wait a minute, 32 million people are going to get health care . I think what he needs to do is to pick some arguments where he can make a case that economic growth and fairness go together. He's got to talk about innovation. He's got to talk about investment, infrastructure, education, and say there is a place for the public sector to make the economy grow and to help people advance in the economy ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Get -- getting the balance right. Right.\n\nMR. DIONNE: ...and get that balance right. And that can appeal to middle of the road people and to his political base .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, let me get a break in here. I want to take a break here. We're going to come back to talk more about Republicans and why 2011 is going to look and sound a lot like 2012 in a lot of quarters. More from our roundtable right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back, joined again by our roundtable , and we're talking about the politics of 2012 . Yes, it's January 2011 , but by this point in the 2008 cycle, we were well on our way. The president's also thinking about Republicans . Here's his reading list from his Hawaiian vacation. What was first on the list there? Lou Cannon 's book about Reagan , \"Role of a Lifetime .\" David Brooks , how do you see this Republican field shaping up? If there was any -- ever a volatile time in, in a Republican nominating process, this is it.\n\nMR. BROOKS: Well, Ron Brownstein in the National Journal had the best way to formulate the field, which is it's divided between the managers and the populists. So the managers are guys like Mitt Romney and Mitch Daniels , who are sort of elitist types, if you want to put it that way, though that's unfair, but who manage well, who are good managers. Then the populists: the Palins , the Gingrichs , the Huckabees . And that's sort of the division. I happen to think the Republican Party 's still a manager party , that they'll lean more toward that way. The thing the Republican Party has to figure out is, and this goes back to the debate we just had, what is the role of government ? If they're strictly going to be, \" Government should get out of the way,\" that's a 38 percent party . If they're going to be, \" Government should do what it can to make us more productive and to achieve more, using government in, in positive ways,\" that's a 55 percent party . And they have to figure out, now that they're in some power , how to not have not only a negative role to cut back government , but a positive role.\n\nMR. GREGORY: This was interesting, Senator - elect , this is how The New York Times put it. Matt Bai in a piece on Thursday wrote this. \"Without any odds-on favorite... Republican voters will spend most of the next year sorting through some difficult and divisive questions about where the party is headed, in a way they haven't really had to do in decades. How conservative can a nominee be, in the post- Bush era, and still be electable? Does the party choose an insider with Washington credentials, like a Senator John Thune of South Dakota , or an outsider like\" Sarah \" Palin , who trades governing gravitas for searing populism? ... \"Do Republicans need a kindly granddad like Mr. Barbour or even a stern headmaster type like Newt Gingrich to reassure a jittery electorate who may fear we've lost our way? Or do they need to nominate someone who embodies the post-boomer,\" rather, \"ethos in the same way that Mr. Obama does maybe a governor like Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota or Mitch Daniels of Indiana ?\" What do you see out there? You'll be worried about doing your own job.\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: That's right .\n\nMR. GREGORY: But certainly Republicans are trying to get elected.\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: It's a wide open field , I think. And I think that the divide that David eluded to is essentially right. I think of it as establishment wing of the party and the tea party wing of the party . And the successful nominee, if he's going to be, or she, is going to be successful in the fall, as well, is going to have to be acceptable to both wings. The, the tea party movement is, is a powerful source of energy , and if the Republicans generally and the Republican nominee in particular is not acceptable to that, to that wing of, of the electorate, then I would be worried about a third party movement that could undermine the center right coalition.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you really think Sarah Palin , if she were the nominee, could carry a state like Pennsylvania ?\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: I, well, I, I think it is possible. I think it's -- you know, we, we went into this election cycle with a 1.2 million voter registration deficit and with a Republican brand that was in a really bad way, and I still won this election . So I, I think the, the electorate wants a return of economic growth , wants serious fiscal discipline . If they believe they've got a candidate that's going to deliver on those things, then it's possible.\n\nMR. GREGORY: How about the reporting, E.J. Dionne , from Newsweek magazine this week about Jon Huntsman , the president's ambassador to China , seen here with the president. He's been the ambassador to China , but in this interview does not rule out the possibility of running in 2012 , a more moderate Republican serving for a Democratic president. Pretty interesting.\n\nMR. DIONNE: I think that was a fascinating story, whether or not Huntsman actually is going to run, because I think what it says is there is a sense in the Republican Party that this field they have so far may not be good enough. They're looking for someone else . And so I think there will be interest in Governor -- Ambassador Huntsman. The fact that he's thinking about it also suggests that he may think President Obama is more vulnerable than he thought when he took this job. The idea was Huntsman was going to wait until 2016 . There's one -- I was rummaging around for historical metaphors. The one that I could think of is Henry Cabot Lodge in 1964 . The -- it was Rockefeller against Goldwater . There was a draft Lodge movement in New Hampshire . Lodge actually won the New Hampshire primary partly because of dissatisfaction with Goldwater and Rockefeller . Now will that happen this time? No.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, but Lodge is dead.\n\nMR. BROOKS: Henry Cabot Lodge , Henry Cabot Lodge has...\n\nMR. DIONNE: He is.\n\nMR. BROOKS: Henry Cabot Lodge has a better chance of winning of the Republican nominations this year than Jon Huntsman does. The guy is in the Obama administration. That's not going to fly.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Well, I think, I think he's a fascinating man and, that given dissatisfaction with the field, there's an opening for him that might not have existed otherwise.\n\nMR. BROOKS: Got it.\n\nMS. KAY: It's not just dissatisfaction. It's also going to be a messier process than perhaps the Republican Party is useful -- is use to. And one of the biggest differences of 2012 over 2008 is going to be the voice that ordinary voters have through Facebook and Twitter . It has, it has revolutionized people's access to a megaphone. It has given them a very strong possibility to say, \"Actually, we're not satisfied with any of the people that the establishment in Washington is presenting to us,\" and that we can mobilize and say who we want, and we can say it with this extraordinary medium that they have. And I think that's going to change the way that the nomination process happens and make it much easier for a populist to come in from the outside.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Stephen Carter , we, we talked about Haley Barbour , The New York Times , in that piece that I just referenced. And he's had an interesting week. There was the case of...\n\nMR. CARTER: That's one way to put it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...of the Scott , the Scott sisters in Mississippi , who were incarcerated on, on robbery charges. A lot of people thought the sentences were way too harsh. And because of a kidney situation with one of the sisters, with Jamie Scott , could be donated by her sister, that the sentences were suspended. Governor Barbour saying there's too much of a medical cost to the state of Mississippi and that this wasn't necessary anymore. He got a lot of praise from the NAACP for doing this, but this comes on the heels of all the criticism he got for talk of the citizens councils when he was growing up in Mississippi . Where does this leave him?\n\nMR. CARTER: I don't know where it, it'll leave him. I'm not, I'm not even sure that, that he's the most electable candidate out there, maybe is the way to think about it . I, I think that something's happened in politics in national politics in the last couple of election cycles. Both the one that brought the Republican House to power now, and the one that brought Obama to power in 2008 , that there's a kind of, of, it was referred to before as dissatisfaction. It's a formulist anger out there in America . And this anger will manifest its way in each election in ways that are very difficult for experts sitting in Washington to predict. Hillary Clinton had that locked up in 2007 . People thought Obama was running for -- he'd be a vice president or he would one day run. And certainly, although some people were talking about this huge Republicans gains, the massive size didn't become apparent really until the last few weeks before the election . The candidate who can ride that anger -- from either party , I might add, because Obama road that anger in 2008 . He rode it. The anger isn't just the left, it isn't just the tea parties. There are angry, frustrated people right in the center .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMR. CARTER: And riding that frustration and anger and disappointment of the people in the center is what's going to get someone elected.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, it is interesting, David , that, that we talk about role of government . What we've talked for many, many months here. But it is this searing populism. Because if you go back to 2008 , that was in part what Obama was about. Yes, it was change , but it was about this anger at what Washington had become and what Republicanism had become at that moment that led to that. And then we see that again in 2010 .\n\nMR. BROOKS: Look, I always say the most important political factor of our lifetime is this\n\npoll number: Do you trust government to do the right thing most of the time? Through the '30s, through the '70s it was 80 percent. Now it's like 19 percent. So people want a government that will work, and they feel their institutions are failing them. So the question is -- and it's partly because we've been stuck in trench warfare. World War I , big governments vs. small government debate . And the president and Republicans aside have to decide whether they want to continue that debate or whether they want to have a new debate and ask a new question. And\n\nthe new question is: Does government help us achieve and produce? Once you ask that question, you get out of the big government \/ small government debate , and you actually have a newer debate .\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: But, but actually I...\n\nMS. KAY:\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: I, I think, if I could, the, there's a lot of data and I think there's a lot of evidence that less government leads to stronger economic growth . And at a time right now where economic growth is such an important premium, I think the people's opinion have -- they, they acknowledge that at some level, and there's a majority that does want less government for that reason.\n\nMR. BROOKS: I think that's largely true. But what about infrastructure spending? I think basic scientific research , I think energy innovation, I think there are, education, early childhood education...\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: It's not to say no government .\n\nMR. BROOKS: Right.\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: I'm not suggesting no government .\n\nMR. BROOKS: But, but, we're having this, we're going to have this debate right on the mark...\n\nMR. GREGORY: About getting the balance right.\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: But...\n\nMR. BROOKS: Right. Exactly. That's right .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Katty :\n\nMS. KAY: One thing I was going to say, on top of what David has said, about not trusting government is, there, there is this sense that the pyramid is flattening, whether it's in the world of business or in the world of politics. And that the, the top has less say, less influence over what the bottom wants. And I think that's a function of people having less trust in what happens in government .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm. We have this huge debate about the role of government . And yet the debate is likely to get more robust about the role of government in Afghanistan because of the enormous amount of money that the government is now paying and that our troops are paying in their own lives. Professor Carter , you wrote this in The Daily Beast before Christmas about Afghanistan . \"...if President Obama still believes the Afghan War to be one of necessity, he needs to tell us exactly what it is that is necessary to do and how we will know when we have done it.\" Which is a question that I'd like to ask, which is, what do you win if you win?\n\nMR. CARTER: That's the question that, I think, the president has to answer. President Obama has said several times, this is a war of necessity, it's war that was forced on us, it's a war of self- defense, it's a war that must be won. Those are very powerful statements. And one balances those statements, it seems to me, with an account of what counts as a victory. It's very difficult to talk about a war that must be won and that has a deadline at which you're going to stop pursuing it. I think one of the reasons that the president has, I think, correctly become -- backed off somewhat of this nation of a deadline, even the most recent White House white paper, is precisely for that reason. But I think that we need a more clearly articulated vision -- and this was true of the last administration as well -- of exactly what count as victory.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Quickly, E.J. , you heard Senator Graham say a permanent U.S. military presence will be required in Afghanistan . That would be important, and that would engender a big debate here.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Right. And I don't think that is where the Obama policy is. This war turns 10 years old this year. We Americans , and I think it's true of democracies generally, are not great at winning long, long wars because people in democracies get impatient and they say, \"Why must we keep having our soldiers die? What are we getting out of it?\" I think President Obama has been trying to redefine this war as he goes along. He clearly does not want a long commitment that goes past 2014 . Having said that, there is some progress, at least in this war, I think, in weakening the Taliban and some of these forces. But it's a mess because you've got, not only Afghanistan , but also what's going on over the border in Pakistan . I still think the Biden policy of trying to focus this on terrorism is going to become more and more attractive as time goes on.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me take a break here. We're going to come back. It was a white Christmas . We're going to talk, however, about the politics of snow that came after the holiday, and a word about hockey, as well, with our roundtable .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back with our last few minutes with our roundtable . A white Christmas is beautiful, but sometimes a white Christmas goes wrong politically. Look at the scenes that played out over Christmas . This was New York City , up and down the East Coast , a monster storm leaving so much snow, and then a lot of questions about the government 's response. Mayor Bloomberg in New York had to answer questions on Tuesday, had a particular tone and changed by Wednesday. Have a look.\n\nMAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: ...cannot be every place at all times. But if you look around, the people behind me are the people that are the best in this country to lead this city and to provide the services we need.\n\nMAYOR BLOOMBERG: We did not do as good a job as we wanted to do or as the city has a right to expect.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And you saw the Daily News with one of its covers here, the tabloids really giving him a hard time , \"Snow Excuses!\" for Mayor Bloomberg . Katty Kay , we know how tough this can be. Chris Christie , over in New Jersey , was in Disney World with his family, who took some criticism for that. Weather can be awfully damaging to a politician.\n\nMS. KAY: Weather can be extremely damaging. And it's really a test of the balance between, I think, competence and empathy, and both are needed. And it's probably one part empathy and three parts competence. If you can actually clear the streets, you are going to win over your public. If you don't clear the streets, the worst thing that you can do is come out and sound unempathetic. I mean, you had the difference between Michael Bloomberg and Cory Booker ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMS. KAY: ...tweeting his way through actually shoveling snow.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right, look at the pictures of Cory Booker ...\n\nMS. KAY: And he's come out of it very well.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...he was out there shoveling by hand.\n\nMS. KAY: It's much easier to come out badly, probably, from a snowstorm than it is to come out well. But Cory Booker showed us how a politician can turn something around to his benefit because he made that mix between actually getting out there and shoveling...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. KAY: ...which showed that he was on top of it and had the competence factor, and having the empathetic factor.\n\nMR. BROOKS: You know, we can make -- you know, I'm for Bloomberg One . You know, we can pay for equipment that we're going to use one day a decade. This was like the sixth biggest snowstorm in New York history .\n\nMS. KAY: But coming out and saying...\n\nMR. BROOKS: Or we could suck it up for a few days and stay inside and watch television.\n\nMS. KAY: But David , David .\n\nMR. BROOKS: So I think New Yorkers just suck it up.\n\nMS. KAY: If you, if you'll...\n\nMR. BROOKS: You don't want to pay for those snow shovels.\n\nMS. KAY: If you're the elected leader coming up and saying...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Brooks , Brooks to New York . We just had a moment there. What about this, though? Let's take it back, E.J. , because I know you wrote about this week. 1969 , another New York mayor running for re- election having to account for another real big storm. This was John Lindsay in 1969 .\n\nMAYOR JOHN LINDSAY: I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter and that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets and that was no mistake. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America , but the things that go right are what make me want it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: How about that?\n\nMR. DIONNE: It is one of the greatest ads in American history because it began -- David Garth , the late David Garth , was the guy who made it and it was a politician being smart and humble enough to say, \"All right, there is no way I will ever spin my way out of this mistake, so I'm going to admit it, and then try to focus people's attention elsewhere.\" But, you know, on snow, we had an abstract argument about government . I think government is much more important to the economic growth than Senator Toomey does. But we expect government to do certain basic things right. And I think that Mayor Bloomberg made a mistake by, on the first day, when he knew it was a mess out there -- and I was stuck in the snow. I was visiting my family in New York , and there was an access lane to the Belt Parkway that looked like a country lane in Vermont , which is very pretty, but it was hard to drive on. You don't just sort of go out and tell people to suck it up. You say, \"I'm trying to get the job done.\" Best line of the week, both about Governor Christie being in Disney World and Mayor Bloomberg , from my colleague Gene Robinson , the role for politicians is \"Be there. Do something.\" And I think that's right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator ?\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: Well, you know, according to Mayor Bloomberg , the best people in the country couldn't clear the snow from the streets. Do we really want to trust them to regulate the Internet ? I think this is, this is, this is why I want to run for mayor.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Always bringing it back home.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah. How about Governor Rendell? I think we have those pictures...\n\nSEN.-ELECT TOOMEY: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...you know, when they moved the game and there was...\n\nMR. BROOKS: He was not happy.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor Rendell , he actually went to that Philly game, and he put the snow out there and he -- you see, empties the bucket. He puts the sign, \"This seat reserved for non- wussies.\" He said that we're becoming a nation of wussies because of the snow. What can I tell you, I'm from Los Angeles so I don't even understand this snowfall. We're going to leave it there. Thanks to all of you, and we've had a great start to the new year here. Speaking of great starts on the weather, how about those Washington Capitols ? They start the year with a 3-1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins -- sorry, Senator -- in the Winter Classic , outside last night. Weather was a factor there. And it was Eric Fehr with the Caps -- look at this -- on the breakaway all alone. Two goals on the night and he scores, getting it done. We're taking on the Pens. We're coming strong. It could be our year. All right. That's it for me and sportscasting. That is all for today, we'll be back next week. If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS .",

    "text":"GOP Task Force, Lone Democrat Eye Trafficking Law\n\nBy Emma Dumain\n\nThe House GOP task force charged with making recommendations to colleagues on the influx of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border might suggest controversial changes to a 2008 trafficking law \u2014 and at least one Democrat wants to go that route as well.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who made headlines on Wednesday for blasting President Barack Obama\u2019s failure to visit the border during a fundraising trip to the area, said he would soon introduce legislation to allow all children apprehended at the southwest border to qualify for \u201cvoluntary return\u201d to their home countries.\n\nA law known as the \u201cWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\u201d gave that right only to children from counties \u201ccontiguous\u201d to the United States, namely Mexico and Canada. Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2014 among other parts of Central America \u2014 Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms.\n\n\u201cAll the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime,\u201d Cuellar told a group of reporters. \u201dThe only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\u201d\n\nCuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with \u201ca little bit of experience\u201d \u2014 a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican \u2014 would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol.\n\nObama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking.\n\nBut most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. \u201cI think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him.\u201d\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday \u2014 and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law.\n\nHe said he had \u201csuspected all along\u201d that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obama\u2019s pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a position that protects children,\u201d Grijalva said, \u201cand a Republican effort \u2026 to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.\u201d\n\nRelated stories:\n\nPresident\u2019s Party Asks Why He\u2019s Avoiding the Border\n\nObama \u2018Happy to Consider\u2019 Sending National Guard to Border to get Votes on Supplemental\n\nA Tale of Two Congressional Visits to the Southwest Border\n\nObama\u2019s Bill for Border Surge Gets Frosty Reception on the Right\n\nObama Asking Congress for $4.3 Billion for Border Crisis, Wildfires\n\nOn Climate Change, Landrieu Stands With Coal, Against Obama\n\nRoll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat\n\nGet breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.",

    "text":"Mitt Romney\u2019s pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.\n\n\n\nRyan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.\n\n\n\nToday, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.\n\n\n\nRyan\u2019s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called \"premium support.\")\n\n\n\nThough House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan\u2019s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.\n\n\n\nThe Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut \"$700 billion\" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!\n\n\n\nFor this check, we\u2019re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.\n\n\n\n\"You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,\" Cutter said. \"You know what those cuts are? It\u2019s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to digest if you\u2019re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them \"cuts\" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.\n\n\n\n$700 billion in Medicare cuts?\n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?\n\n\n\nWell, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally \"cut\" a dollar from the Medicare program\u2019s budget.\n\n\n\nRather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.\n\n\n\nHospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.\n\n\n\nStill, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would \"cut\" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we\u2019ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.\n\n\n\nBecause Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law\u2019s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.\n\n\n\nThe CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s timing that\u2019s making the \"cuts\" bigger, not changes to Medicare.\n\n\n\nDoes the Ryan budget \u2018protect those cuts\u2019?\n\n\n\nNow onto our second question: Does Ryan\u2019s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney\u2019s running mate:\n\n\n\nStephanopoulos: \"You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.\n\n\n\nRyan: \"Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ...\" (Read the full exchange.)\n\n\n\nSo Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.\n\n\n\nThe Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter\u2019s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.\n\n\n\n\"Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama\u2019s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,\" said Lanhee Chen, Romney\u2019s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. \"A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.\"\n\n\n\nCutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn\u2019t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn\u2019t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n\nStill, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nCutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but \"Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan.\n\nCutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney\u2019s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.\n\n\n\nStill, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.",
