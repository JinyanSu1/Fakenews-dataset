    "text":"At the CNN debate in Miami, GOP candidates sparred over immigration, social security, how to talk about Muslims and more. \n\nHere are the key moments. (Video: Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. John Kasich debated Thursday night in Miami, five days before the winner-take-all GOP primary in Florida. The complete transcript is posted below. Washington Post reporters and readers using Genius have annotated it, and will continue to do so following the debate.\n\nTo see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\n\nJake Tapper introduced the candidates and the debate began.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, we will start with you.\n\nKASICH: Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I believe it's a new partnership -- a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio?\n\nRUBIO: Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.\n\nRUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.\n\nThis election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before -- 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old -- never voted before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.\n\nWe're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nLet's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in -- on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls \"disastrous trade deals\" in order to bring jobs back to America.\n\nGovernor Kasich, I'd like to start with you. You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?\n\nKASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.\n\nBut my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \"Oh, America was right,\" and people are out of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.\n\nBut we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.\n\nTrade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.\n\nWhy should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, \"generally very much in favor of free trade.\" More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?\n\nRUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.\n\nThe problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.\n\nOn the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?\n\nCRUZ: Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.\n\nAnd the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.\n\nAnd you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.\n\nNumber one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?\n\nRUBIO: If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.\n\nThe second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire -- Disney or some other company hires this company.\n\nWhat they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.\n\nIt is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou've -- in the -- in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.\n\nRUBIO: Correct.\n\nDINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.\n\nRUBIO: Well first, I think -- well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.\n\nIf there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not -- what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.\n\nThey are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \"lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\". He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?\n\nKAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.\n\nImmigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we -- I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.\n\nI would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.\n\nAnd I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.\n\nBut let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.\n\nWe can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.\n\nTRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\n\nWhen it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of -- and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.\n\nAnd I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.\n\nWe have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just -- we're leading with the chin.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nWe're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.\n\nDINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?\n\nCRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.\n\nAnd the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.\n\nWe're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. Everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power. And the Obama administration has abused executive power.\n\nBeyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.\n\nAnd let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child -- African American, Hispanic -- every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.\n\nLet me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \"We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\" they're not being honest with you.\n\nSocial Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.\n\nFor example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIf I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.\n\nThese are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my -- my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.\n\nBut again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.\n\nThat's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.\n\nAnd that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.\n\nI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.\n\nTRUMP: And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.\n\nYou have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...\n\nI mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a -- it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.\n\nWe've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?\n\nTRUMP: Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take -- every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.\n\nTRUMP: We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. Please help me polish this news and return your answer with the format Title:__",

    "description":"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman talks with Rachel Maddow about the coalition of states suing Donald Trump over his suspension of DACA.",
    "text":"A new lawsuit has been filed against former President Donald Trump, accusing him of \"discriminatory animus\" towards recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This legal action comes as Trump also faces mounting scrutiny and legal challenges over various allegations, including potential indictments.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by a coalition of immigrant rights groups, argues that Trump's decision to terminate DACA was motivated by racial bias and animosity. DACA, established in 2012, protects young undocumented immigrants, commonly referred to as Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as children. The termination of DACA, an executive order issued by President Barack Obama, has been a contentious issue ever since.\n\nLegal experts supporting the plaintiffs claim that Trump's decision to revoke DACA was not based on legitimate policy concerns but rather on discriminatory prejudices against immigrants. They argue that this action violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn recent months, multiple court rulings have blocked efforts by the Trump administration to end DACA fully. However, the latest lawsuit seeks to hold Trump personally accountable for his alleged discriminatory actions. The plaintiffs hope that this legal action will result in a court ruling that prevents any future attempts to dismantle the program.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump faces a separate legal battle as reports suggest he could potentially be indicted on various charges. In a recent segment on her show, political commentator Rachel Maddow discussed the possibility of Trump being indicted, asserting that he knew his actions were wrongful when committing them.\n\nThe potential indictment revolves around a number of matters, including potential finance and tax-related violations. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations will be addressed within the legal system.",

    "description":"The House minority leader's comments came in a week when the Dow topped 14,200 for the first time in history. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.",
    "text":"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling on Congress to dramatically increase the hourly minimum wage. In a press conference at the Capitol, the California Democrat emphasized that the recent record-high levels of the stock market have not translated into benefits for middle-class workers. Pelosi urged Congress to address this disparity and take action to close the gap.\n\n\nPelosi pointed out, \"This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace, but we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same since the end of the Clinton years.\"\n\n\nHighlighting the need to honor the commitment to the middle class, Pelosi urged Congress to reflect this intention in public policy. She referenced a bill sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), which proposes raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years and indexing future increases to inflation.\n\n\nThe Democrats' bill goes further than President Obama's proposal of increasing the minimum wage to $9 per hour, as outlined in his February State of the Union address. Harkin recently criticized Obama, stating that he \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.\n\n\nPelosi's plea for a minimum-wage hike coincides with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a historic high of 14,200 points. However, wages, as a percentage of the economy, remain at an all-time low (43.5 percent of GDP last year), and the nation's unemployment rate has stubbornly hovered around 8 percent for the past six months.\n\n\nEconomists attribute the lack of trickle-down benefits from corporate profits to factors such as the increasing productivity of the workforce and companies' hesitancy to hire in a still-unstable economy.\n\n\nThe last time Congress approved a minimum-wage increase was in 2007, as part of a must-pass bill that provided funds for the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was contingent upon including $5 billion in business tax breaks, and it was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.\n\n\nHowever, with the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage increase could harm hiring during a period of job crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill faces an uphill battle in the GOP-controlled House. Nevertheless, Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping that the combination of surging Wall Street gains and stagnating wages for the middle class will resonate with voters.\n\n\nPelosi concluded by saying, \"When we increased it in 2007, it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years. It's time for it to be increased again.\"\n\n\nSource:\n\nhttp:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/house\/286795-pelosi-urges-minimum-wage-hike",

    "description":"Fred Thompson bills himself as a true southern conservative and a plain-ol\u2019-folks regular guy. But is he just playing a part?",
    "text":"Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It\u2019s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. \u201cI\u2019m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,\u201d he says as he plows toward the ballroom.\n\nInside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson\u2019s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman\u2014a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband\u2019s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.\n\nThe room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson script\u2014a bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. \u201cI was telling one of my buddies up there, \u2018You know, it\u2019s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Well, don\u2019t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.\u2019\u201d Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. \u201cAnd then he says, \u2018Thompson, you got it all covered.\u2019\u201d Everyone laughs.\n\nToday, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. \u201cWe can\u2019t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We\u2019ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can\u2019t prove they\u2019re terrorists within 24 hours, you\u2019ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain\u2019t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.\u201d\n\nSomeone shouts \u201cGo, Fred, go.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. \u201cPeople talk about the last election. They say, \u2018The war, the war, the war,\u2019\u201d Thompson says with a sigh. \u201cI think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it\u2019s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made a partnership with the alligators instead.\u201d\n\nA minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. \u201cMaybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues.\u201d The applause builds to a standing ovation. \u201cYou know, I had another comment or two,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cbut I think that\u2019s the perfect place to stop.\u201d\n\nThompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. \u201cYou know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,\u201d Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. \u201cWithout raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I\u2019ve already saved $50 million this year.\u201d Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.\n\nSince announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson\u2019s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn\u2019t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.\n\nSo far, the Thompson bubble has floated skyward on several favorable updrafts. He\u2019s the newest man in the race\u2014and one with celebrity name recognition. He\u2019s a Southerner and arguably the most conservative candidate in a field devoid of hard-liners. Despite his eight years in the Senate, people seem to buy the idea, for the time being anyway, that he\u2019s a Washington outsider. And all of his opponents have significant liabilities. But then again, so does Thompson. Among them are his work ethic and authenticity.\n\nThompson is often compared to Ronald Reagan, not just because they are both actors, but also because of each man\u2019s almost preternatural affability. But Reagan was an unalloyed ideologue when America was looking for one, with eight years as the chief executive of what amounts to one of the world\u2019s largest countries. He wasn\u2019t elected until his third campaign, when he defeated a weak Democratic incumbent. Fred Thompson is in a different place. If he\u2019s going to be elected the leader of the Free World, he may have to do it on the strength of his not inconsiderable personal charm.\n\nYou can\u2019t get to Fred Thompson\u2019s hometown from here. Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is located 28 miles from the nearest interstate. Its rolling hills are picturesquely dotted with pigs and cattle, but it remains one of the state\u2019s poorest areas. \u201cThis town hasn\u2019t been the same since the Yankees came in and opened the Murray bike factory,\u201d says Tommy Beuerlein, who owns a downtown pharmacy and was a classmate of Thompson\u2019s. The bike factory arrived in 1955. \u201cNixon was right about there being a silent majority in America,\u201d Beuerlein proudly says. \u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d\n\nOn a recent summer day, eighteen people attended a city-council meeting dealing with the local problem of illegal dumping of couches. A few steps away, 71 residents, some of them as young as 9, attended a shotgun-safety class. \u201cYou have to respect your zone of fire,\u201d insisted the instructor. \u201cVice-President Cheney didn\u2019t respect his zone of fire, and look what happened.\u201d\n\nMuch of Thompson\u2019s down-home affability can be attributed to his roots in Lawrenceburg, where as a child he pretended to be Western star Lash LaRue and courted his high-school sweetheart underneath the town\u2019s Davy Crockett statue (true story). But while Thompson may be a country boy, he\u2019s a certain type of country boy: the one who plays possum while you mock his cornpone ways. Next thing you know he\u2019s got your girl and holds the deed to your farm.\n\nThompson\u2019s father, Fletch, ran a used-car lot in the center of town, and would talk Republican politics at the Blue Ribbon Caf\u00e9. Neither of Thompson\u2019s parents attended high school (his father eventually earned a GED), and Fred, the first of two sons, proved to be an indifferent but popular student. Even as a kid, Fred had a flair for showmanship. One of the building blocks of the Thompson legend is the story of his concerned football coach\u2019s running onto the field to check on an injured Thompson. When coach Garner Ezell reached his player, Thompson smiled at his fellow Church of Christ parishioner and quipped, \u201cHow\u2019s the crowd takin\u2019 it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFred said it,\u201d says Ezell. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t ever hurt. He was just tired and wanted a rest.\u201d\n\nEven a blind squirrel sometimes finds a nut, and Thompson has always seemed to have a way of stumbling into success. By all accounts, Thompson\u2019s work ethic kicked in at 17, when he got his sweetheart Sarah Lindsey pregnant and immediately proposed. \u201cI barely got out of high school,\u201d Thompson told the Washington Post in 1985. \u201cI was interested in two things\u2014and sports was one of them.\u201d\n\nBecause of his marriage, Thompson didn\u2019t play sports his senior year, and he put in long shifts at the bike factory to support his new family. The following fall, the newlyweds headed to nearby Florence State, now the University of North Alabama, before transferring to Memphis State, from which they both graduated. Sarah\u2019s grandfather was an influential Lawrenceburg lawyer, and her family urged Thompson to apply to Vanderbilt Law School. After graduating, the couple moved back to Lawrenceburg, and Thompson practiced law with Sarah\u2019s uncle and began dabbling in local GOP politics, eventually joining the county\u2019s Republican Executive Committee. It was through that group that Thompson caught the eye of another accidental benefactor, Tennessee senator Howard Baker. Thompson worked on Baker\u2019s 1972 reelection, sometimes driving the senator around Tennessee, and the two men struck up a friendship.\n\nBy the next year, Watergate was everywhere. And while Yale and Harvard up-and-comers like Hillary Clinton and Bill Weld clawed for minor legal positions, Baker offered Thompson a coveted slot as minority counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee.\n\nIn 1975, Thompson wrote \"At That Point in Time: The Inside Story of the Senate Watergate Committee\", about the experience, portraying himself as the picture of the awestruck country lawyer. He insists when Baker offered him the job in February of 1973, \u201cthe only names I could recall without prompting were Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy.\u201d\n\nBecause it was a Republican investigator who had uncovered the fact that Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield had admitted that the White House featured an elaborate taping system, Baker insisted that a Republican cross-examine Butterfield the next day so the GOP could maintain the illusion of impartiality\u2014and take credit. On national television, Thompson asked Butterfield the now famous line, \u201cAre you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?\u201d Butterfield famously answered yes (as everyone already knew he would). It was Thompson\u2019s first star turn, a role that marked him in America\u2019s minds as a righteous heavyweight prosecutor.\n\nThompson\u2019s own book suggests he wasn\u2019t exactly an impartial participant in the proceedings, however. He admits to leaking the news about the Butterfield discovery to Nixon\u2019s lawyers without authorization. Transcripts from the Nixon Tapes also suggest Thompson was at least partially in Nixon\u2019s pocket. As the Watergate Committee prepared to call Nixon aide John Dean, Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt coached Thompson on how to question Dean. Buzhardt told Nixon, \u201cI found Thompson most cooperative, feeling more Republican every day.\u201d The next day, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig reported to the president, \u201cHe [Thompson] thinks we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d Of course, they were not. Not long after, Dean became the first Nixon aide to directly tie the president to the break-in and cover-up. But Thompson\u2019s reputation as a plain-speaking crusader for truth and justice had already been made.\n\nThompson\u2019s acting career also happened by accident. After parlaying his Watergate fame into big speaking fees and the start of a lucrative lobbying career (his clients included Westinghouse and the Tennessee savings-and-loans industry), Thompson returned to private practice in Tennessee. There, he wound up representing Marie Ragghianti, the head of the Tennessee Parole Board who was fired by Democratic governor Ray Blanton for exposing a parole-for-sale scheme. Ragghianti sued for wrongful dismissal, and Thompson won the case. Serpico author Peter Maas wrote a book about Ragghianti\u2019s story that was eventually optioned as a movie with Sissy Spacek slated to play the title role.\n\nAccording to Thompson lore, director Roger Donaldson had to plead with Thompson to audition to play himself. \u201cThe idea of him playing himself was reached,\u201d Donaldson told the Nashville Tennessean in May of this year. \u201cAnd so I said to Fred, \u2018Would you be interested at having a go at playing yourself?\u2019 He was like, \u2018Shucks, do you think I could do that?\u2019 I said, \u2018You never know until you try.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, back in 1985, when the movie was made, Thompson freely admitted he\u2019d lobbied Donaldson hard until he scored an audition. Although the film wasn\u2019t especially successful, Thompson received raves, including one that described him as the movie\u2019s \u201creal discovery.\u201d\n\nBored with the law and in the process of getting a divorce from Lindsey, Thompson started work on a novel and began going on auditions. The book was never published, but within a few years, Thompson had become a Hollywood go-to guy for gruff government types, eventually playing a CIA director in No Way Out and a navy admiral in The Hunt for Red October. Most of his parts didn\u2019t take long to film, so Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game. Tennessee insiders tried to persuade Thompson to run for the retiring Baker\u2019s seat in 1984, but he declined, quipping to the Washington Post, \u201cthe hassle factor is up and the pay is not.\u201d\n\nThe day after his South Carolina speech in June, Thompson headed to New Hampshire for a bit of packaged politicking to be chronicled by the home team. With rare exceptions, Thompson has limited his media exposure to reliably conservative outlets like The Weekly Standard, Sean Hannity, and Fox News. This morning, Fox had the exclusive.\n\nThe first stop was Riley\u2019s gun shop, the largest rifle-and-pistol joint in New Hampshire. A few minutes after noon, two black SUVs barreled down the two-lane blacktop and were waved into the parking lot by a Thompson aide. The cars emptied, and Thompson emerged with Jeri. Thompson\u2019s blue suit was a torrent of wrinkles\u2014he conjured up \u201960 Nixon more than \u201980 Reagan. His better half looked, well, better in a smart black suit that seemed a slight bit of overkill for a gun-and-ammo stop. They held hands and walked up a wheelchair-accessible ramp into Riley\u2019s, where two or three customers idly chatted with the help about the stability of this or that rifle scope.\n\nThompson glanced around at the 4,000 guns, and strode toward an employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into your record, and I\u2019m really looking forward to you getting into the race,\u201d said Robert Brown, a 34-year-old salesman. Thompson beamed, pumped his hand, and told him, \u201cWe need to get back to basics.\u201d\n\nFred and Jeri then made a loop of the store, pausing before a glass display case that could be used to showcase engagement rings. Here at Riley\u2019s, it housed a dozen glimmering Saturday night specials. Thompson lovingly nudged his spouse and tilted his noggin toward a coal-black .38 Smith & Wesson and cooed, \u201cHoney, would you like one of those?\u201d\n\nOn the way out, I tried again to get Thompson to veer off-script. I jokingly asked him if he had more experience hunting than does Romney, who had been lampooned for saying he hunted varmints. As in a bad movie, time stopped for a second as I realized I\u2019d just set foot on a land mine of my own laying. Jeri beamed, and Fred halted his walk back to the car. He shot a look at the camera crews\u2014Fox had sent two\u2014and waited a second for everyone to settle in again. This is why they made the visit: It was time to contrast the man\u2019s man Thompson with his effete competitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a little different eating habits,\u201d joked Thompson. \u201cI\u2019ve hunted pheasants, and I like to skeet shoot. We\u2019d hold a celebrity skeet-shooting contest in Washington, raise money for juvenile diabetes. Now, I\u2019ve held it, I\u2019ve never won it. They couldn\u2019t slow those things down enough for me.\u201d\n\nThe Fox crew nodded appreciatively. A moment later, the SUVs peeled away. The whole stop lasted far shorter than an episode of Law & Order, and was just as well-directed.\n\nThompson changed his mind about the Senate in 1993, when Al Gore was elected vice-president and his seat became open. Thompson\u2019s opponent was Congressman Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat and the son of a former governor. At first, the candidates projected similar images of dark-suited blandness. \u201cI remember an early event at the Peabody hotel in Memphis,\u201d says Mike Kopp, Cooper\u2019s press secretary. \u201cCooper was a black hole of charisma: He didn\u2019t have any, and he\u2019d suck up yours. But Fred didn\u2019t come across as exactly electric.\u201d\n\nIn May 1994, Thompson trailed badly and talked of quitting. Frustrated, he called Knoxville political consultant Tom Ingram, who had masterminded Lamar Alexander\u2019s 1978 election as Tennessee governor. Alexander wasn\u2019t Mr. Personality either, but he caught fire when Ingram put him in a plaid shirt and had him walk across the state (a tactic, it\u2019s worth noting, that later bombed when Alexander ran for president). Thompson and Ingram met at a Cracker Barrel restaurant halfway between Nashville and Knoxville. \u201cHe was talking of getting out, and I asked him how\u2019d he want to do this,\u201d remembers Ingram. \u201cFred said, \u2018Just driving around talking to people.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s get you a truck and do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough some of his campaign staff protested the move as cheesy, they leased Thompson a red Chevy pickup and he hit the road. Cooper attempted to paint Thompson as phony, calling him a \u201cGucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Poupon\u2013spreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist.\u201d But voters loved the truck. They didn\u2019t seem to mind that the candidate often switched from a sedan to the truck just miles from his appearances. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe anyone was buying it,\u201d says Kopp. \u201cWe underestimated him. What we didn\u2019t get is that Fred is the country version of a street kid. He\u2019s been talking his way out of situations since he was in high school. He\u2019s a charmer. People fall for it.\u201d\n\nKopp and Ingram are friends, and Kopp expresses admiration for the consultant\u2019s work. \u201cFred Thompson was miscast at the beginning of the race,\u201d Kopp says. \u201cSo Tom just recast the role, and Fred Thompson played it perfectly.\u201d\n\nIngram disagrees. \u201cThe reason the truck worked is that that is Fred Thompson. Gimmicks fail in campaigns all the time because they don\u2019t ring true. Yeah, Fred is a lawyer and an actor, but he is also a country guy. People sense that.\u201d\n\nThompson ended up winning by twenty points, partially aided by the Gingrich sweep of 1994. He drove the red truck to Washington where his old boss Baker threw a raucous party for him. According to The Washington Monthly, a gleeful Thompson mentioned that the craziness made him think of the party his fellow Tennessean Andrew Jackson had at the White House on the night of his inauguration.\n\n\u201cOne office at a time,\u201d cautioned Baker.\n\nA few hours after the Riley\u2019s stop in Manchester, Thompson reappeared for a fund-raiser at Bedford\u2019s Wayfarer Inn, a hotel known for decades as a base for reporters boozing their way through the New Hampshire primaries. On this 90-degree summer scorcher, the air-conditioning in the small conference room where Thompson was supposed to greet high rollers was on the fritz. Not even Jeri\u2019s perky smile and repeated recanting of \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jeri, and I\u2019m your official greeter tonight\u201d could relieve the torpor.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, Thompson emerged, covered in sweat and looking dangerously gray. For a moment, a \u201cWhat the hell have I got myself into?\u201d look crossed his face. There was another, less exclusive fund-raiser just down the hall, packed with TV cameras (the Fox exclusive had been lifted), but Thompson bargained for some down time. \u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t look like a man in game shape.\n\nTwenty minutes later, a car drove him to the other side of the hotel, either to make his entrance grander or to save him the two-minute walk. After a brief introduction, Thompson took the microphone and talked about terrorism. He spoke in a reassuring, fatherly voice. \u201cWe\u2019re confronted with a group of people who killed thousands of our people and would like nothing more than to get their hands on technology to kill millions,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ready to resume a war that\u2019s been going on for hundreds of years, and they have another hundred-year plan. Some of our leaders got a plan for the next election,\u201d he continued, presumably referring to those leaders who want to pull out of Iraq. \u201cAnd they think they can win votes out of it.\u201d As a policy idea, it wasn\u2019t what one would call a breakthrough, nor was it much of an applause line. When Thompson talks about issues, his speeches tend to lose focus and drift.\n\nBut when the speech ended and the music blared, Thompson got in the Country Fred groove. He was doing the walk and talk, where he is most successful. \u201cKeep your powder dry,\u201d Thompson told his fans. He paused mid-mob to answer a Franklin Pierce College poli-sci student\u2019s question about entitlements. This time it was a TV reporter who ventured an unsanctioned question, asking Thompson whether he was a lazy man. Thompson didn\u2019t get angry; he just laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said about me before I ran the first time, and that\u2019s what they said about me two years later,\u201d he replied. \u201cI won the first time by twenty points, and 21 points the second time. If you can do that while being lazy, I recommend it to everyone.\u201d\n\nthe greatest testament to the power of Fred Thompson\u2019s down-home likability might be that his Senate years were widely viewed as a train wreck, yet he emerged not only unscathed but also as a presidential contender.\n\nThings started auspiciously enough. Because Thompson had been elected to fill Gore\u2019s unexpired term, he was sworn in a month before other freshmen senators on December 9, 1994. Republicans didn\u2019t waste any time putting the actor in front of the cameras. On December 15, Thompson gave the Republicans\u2019 response to President Clinton\u2019s budget address. Thompson spoke for only five minutes, but he struck a chord. A STAR IS BORN read the headline of Frank Rich\u2019s New York Times column.\n\nBut that would be the high point. Thompson spent the next two years accomplishing almost nothing of significance other than raising money for his 1996 reelection: Thompson brought back the red truck and won in a walk.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton easily trounced Bob Dole in that year\u2019s presidential race, allegations surfaced that the Chinese government had funneled money into the Clinton campaign and that Al Gore had attended a fund-raiser at a Los Angeles Buddhist temple financed by foreign nationals. Thompson, chairman of the previously backwaterish Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which had jurisdiction, called for hearings.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the hearings that July, the papers were filled with stories of Thompson\u2019s Watergate role and his prosecutorial flair. The Democrats\u2019 ranking minority member was John Glenn, and the conventional wisdom was that Thompson would charm the octogenarian into submission. It didn\u2019t happen. Thompson condescended to Glenn and alienated members of his own party. When New Hampshire Republican Bob Smith announced in his opening statement, \u201cIt is probably the biggest scandal in the history of the Republic,\u201d Thompson turned to the Democratic side, rolled his eyes, and muttered, \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Thompson donated his Senate papers to the University of Tennessee. Some of his archives are filled with notes of off-the-record interviews Thompson conducted with reporters during his Senate years. In his papers, Thompson complains about the trouble he had managing his colleagues during the 1996 hearings. He speaks of \u201cmembers on your [own] side, grilling your team to a point where [you have to] get them to a room, woodshed them, [on] how to ask questions, how to proceed.\u201d\n\nThompson was also accused of grandstanding, and his relationship with then Republican Senate leaders Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell quickly soured. Soon Thompson was warring with both sides. \u201c[We have] presidents at fund-raisers, Lott [saying] raising money is the American Way, [and] McConnell [is the] Darth Vader of Reform,\u201d Thompson says in one of the off-the-record sessions found in his archives.\n\nThompson\u2019s hearings grew even more unpopular with his own party when he diverted the proceedings to the subject of campaign-finance reform (Senate Republicans opposed such reform for fear of losing hard-won fund-raising advantages). Lott was furious, and Thompson suspected the majority leader was the anonymous author of quotes criticizing the hearings.\n\nThe senator further angered conservatives by becoming an early supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. Although Thompson has recently tried to minimize his enthusiasm for the bill, his Senate papers include a handwritten note from Senator Russell Feingold after the measure passed the Senate in 2001 reading, \u201cYou were essential to our success from the outset!\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s Senate years also featured a level of sympathy for Bill Clinton that conservatives don\u2019t tend to share. In 1995, Thompson\u2019s archives show, he sent Clinton a note after the State of the Union address that partially read, \u201cThe speech probably would not have seemed so long to some of us if you hadn\u2019t been putting the wood to us so effectively.\u201d Thompson\u2019s 1999 split vote on Clinton\u2019s two counts of impeachment squared with one of his off-the-record sessions in 1998, when he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m prejudiced in his favor, I object to the tactics used against him.\u201d This didn\u2019t stop Thompson from sending Kenneth Starr a congratulations letter at the end of the Clinton saga.\n\nThompson may blast colleagues for not draining the Washington swamp, but he did his share of feeding the alligators. His papers include ingratiating notes to George Will, Arianna Huffington, and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. There\u2019s a mash note from Bruce Willis (\u201cYou were great in Die Hard\u201d) and a letter from Oliver Stone thanking Thompson for brokering an interview with Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray.\n\nThompson\u2019s off-the-record chats with reporters also suggest that his claim that he hasn\u2019t given much thought to running for president might be somewhat disingenuous (his campaign has attempted to make a virtue of the fact that Thompson, unlike his competitors, isn\u2019t obsessed with power). During one 1998 off-the-record bull session, Thompson boasted to a reporter, \u201cAl Gore goes to bed at night and says, \u2018Please don\u2019t let it be Fred Dalton Thompson.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a senator and movie star of a certain age, Thompson was a steadily sought-after D.C. bachelor. He alternately dated Lorrie Morgan, a five-times-married country-music star, Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, former Time columnist Margaret Carlson, and Washington socialite Georgette Mosbacher. \u201cI chased a lot of women, and a lot of women chased me,\u201d Thompson told Republican congressmen earlier this year. \u201cAnd those that chased me tended to catch me.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s relationships with the Washington elite, romantic and otherwise, have paid significant dividends. This March, Carlson talked up Thompson\u2019s presidential possibilities on MSNBC, rhapsodizing, \u201cHe\u2019s handsome, he\u2019s charming, he sounds like a president, and he looks like a president.\u201d She didn\u2019t disclose their prior personal relationship.\n\nThompson scored more gravitas points last month when Washington Post columnist and socialite Sally Quinn breathlessly wrote that Vice-President Dick Cheney was on his way out and should be replaced by, yes, Fred Thompson. \u201cEverybody loves Fred,\u201d Quinn wrote. \u201cHe has the healing qualities of Gerald Ford and the movie-star appeal of Ronald Reagan.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, they both appeared in the 1994 remake of Born Yesterday.\n\nTalking about his Senate years in July, Thompson said, \u201cWhen I served eight years, I left. I was following George Washington\u2019s model of serving eight years, getting on his horse, and never coming back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only partially true. After 9\/11, Thompson announced he would seek reelection the next year. But in January 2002, Thompson\u2019s daughter Betsy died of an accidental drug overdose, ending a long, troubled life. In March, Thompson withdrew his candidacy and sharply criticized the media coverage of Betsy\u2019s death. \u201cI simply do not have the heart for another six years,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nA few months before he left office, Thompson received a call. This time, his career angel was Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, who offered him the role of Arthur Branch over the phone. He immediately accepted. Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game in 2004 by taking on Equitas Ltd., a British reinsurer responsible for paying out millions in asbestos claims. Equitas wanted Senate legislation that would limit its liability and paid Thompson $760,000 over the next three years. He also serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and in 2005 helped shepherd Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts through his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIn 2002, Thompson married Jeri. The couple met in 1995 (Jeri was a Republican spokesperson at the time) on the Nashville yacht of Dale Gish, on the Fourth of July. Their relationship was on and off for years, with Kehn memorably complaining about other rivals to the New York Post in 2000. \u201cThey just won\u2019t leave him alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get up to get a cocktail at a party without coming back and finding some girl sitting in my chair.\u201d Fred and Jeri have since had two children, Hayden and an 8-month-old son named Samuel.\n\nLast November, Thompson said he wouldn\u2019t run for president, telling a political dinner-party gathering, \u201cI would have had to start two years ago if I was going to run. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever want to jump back in.\u201d\n\nBut with Giuliani, McCain, and Romney appearing vulnerable, Howard Baker began making calls around Washington to gauge the interest for a late-entering telegenic southern senator.\n\nOr so the story goes. Some Republican insiders say it is Jeri who is fanning Thompson\u2019s presidential aspirations. While Ingram won\u2019t confirm that, he does say Jeri played an influential role in the handling of her husband\u2019s April announcement that he had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but is now in remission. The move was seen as a way of clearing the decks for a Thompson presidential run. \u201cHe relies on her,\u201d Ingram says. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely partners.\u201d\n\nTo some, Jeri has already become a target. MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough mused, \u201cYou think she works the pole?\u201d and the New York Times \u201cStyles\u201d section raised the question of whether America was ready for a trophy-wife First Lady.\n\nAfter getting the high sign from Thompson, Ingram began talking up a Thompson candidacy on Capitol Hill, where Ingram now works as Lamar Alexander\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cI was at the Capitol Hill Club at Bill Hecht\u2019s table,\u201d recalls Ingram, name-dropping the presence of a prominent Republican lobbyist. \u201cCongressmen and lobbyists were coming up to me, and they were all really excited. It\u2019s the closest thing to a presidential draft in my lifetime,\u201d Ingram insists. I asked him whether the well-heeled well-wishers were familiar with Thompson from his Senate days. He hemmed and hawed a bit. \u201cWell no, they mostly know him more from Law & Order than the Senate, but Fred\u2019s not acting on the show. That\u2019s exactly the way Fred was in his Senate office.\u201d\n\nNow comes the hard part. With Thompson all but officially in the race, the media has begun training its sights on his backside. First, the Times dissected the political-consulting.",

Three wars and billions of dollars later, we'lldiscuss all of this with the president's former national securityadviser in his first interview since leaving the White House.\n\nAlso, who will pay for it all?\n\nThe jobs picture is getting brighter. But could rising prices,revolution, and a nuclear disaster kill the recovery? And as partisanbickering meets the bloated budget, will the government shut downlater this week?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. MIKE PENCE R-IND.: I say, shut it down.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Two top senators join us for a This Week debate.\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, This Week startsright now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome to the program. Right now, the Middle East isfalling further into chaos, violence and uncertainty as the UnitedStates grapples with fresh challenges in two of its three wars.President Obama, who ran as the anti-war candidate, now finds himselfstruggling to defend new American military action overseas, while therapidly changing situations in Libya, Afghanistan, and across theMiddle East pose new threats to U.S. security and credibility.\n\nI'll be talking to my colleagues Mike Boettcher and Nick Schifrinin Afghanistan, and Jeffrey Kaufman and Alex Marquardt on the frontlines in Libya.\n\nLet's turn first to Afghanistan, where a firefight along thePakistan border brought one of the deadliest days for American troopsin months, and where the battle for hearts and minds may have beenvirtually erased overnight at the hands of a fringe pastor in Florida.\n\nAfter months of threatening to burn a copy of the Koran, PastorTerry Jones and his handful of followers finally did just that. Thisdeliberately provocative act received little media attention here inthe United States, but it did spread like wildfire online. And withindays, protests in Afghanistan turned deadly.\n\nABC's Mike Boettcher is embedded with the 101st AirborneDivision. Mike was the lone reporter on that bloody six-day offensivealong the border.\n\nMike, how bad was that?\n\nMIKE BOETTCHER, ABC CORRESPONDENT: In 30 years of covering war,I have never seen such withering fire. And soldiers who have beendeployed four or five times will tell you the same thing.\n\nA high price was paid. Six U.S. soldiers were killed. Six werewounded. Two Afghan national army were killed. And seven Afghanswere wounded in this battle, and the battle continues as we speak,right now.\n\nThis is a significant engagement because it marks a turning pointor a change in strategy along the Pakistan border where bases havebeen closed in recent months, small combat outposts. The U.S. nowsays that they're taking a more mobile strategy, going to areas theyhaven't been before, and going after the Taliban. They're going tocarry this through, through the spring and summer and expect to seevery heavy fighting in the east part of the country in the comingyear. Christiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Meantime, in cities across Afghanistan today, morescenes of rage and violence in response to that Florida pastor'sdecision to burn a Koran. The situation does present a grave newproblem for the United States. And ABC's Nick Schifrin joins me nowfrom Kabul.\n\nNick, today, General Petraeus had to come out and specificallycondemn the burning of that Koran. How bad is it there?\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've seen threeprotests three days in a row now, massive protests, 8,000 miles awayfrom that Koran-burning. Today thousands of Afghans in the streets ofsouthern Afghanistan and eastern Afghanistan, they were burning U.S.flags and chanting \"death to President Obama.\"\n\nNow David Petraeus came out with that statement today, but thereis one good piece of news. The Afghan police did not shoot into thecrowds like they did yesterday. On Friday, they were supposed to bethe first line of defense around a U.N. building where seven U.N.workers were killed. They were not able to keep those workers -- keepthose protesters out of that U.N. building.\n\nAnd U.S. officials are deeply concerned about that, because theplace where that happened, Mazar-i-Sharif, is the first city that issupposed to transfer to Afghan control, to transfer to Afghan policecontrol in three months.\n\nAnd U.S. and U.N. officials are worried that this incident is asign that the police aren't ready to take control -- Christiane. AMANPOUR: Nick, thank you. And obviously we'll keep monitoringthat situation.\n\nAnd now we turn to Libya. America's newest war is entering itsthird week of bombing, and still there is no sign that Colonel Gadhafiis stepping down. And now more bad news for the makeshift rebelforces. NATO warplanes seem to have mistakenly bombed one of theirconvoys. Another blow in a week where they've seen most of theirgains against Gadhafi wiped out.\n\nJust Monday, the rebels were within striking distance ofcapturing Gadhafi's home town of Sirt. And they had the capitalTripoli in their sites. But by week's end, they were beating a hastyretreat with Gadhafi forces once again in control of the long stretchof coastline.\n\nOur reporters in Libya have been tracking all of this. JeffreyKaufman just arrived in Tripoli, and Alex Marquardt joins us from therebel bastion of Benghazi. Let's start with Jeffrey.\n\nJeffrey, in Tripoli, any signs of the tension or that maybeGadhafi is on his last few days?\n\nJEFFREY KAUFMAN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, actually, just momentsago we heard a NATO warplane flying above us. We didn't hear anybombs dropping. But, you know, it's actually remarkably normal here.You can see the traffic behind me on the highway.\n\nAs we came in, we saw a lot of military checkpoints, long linesfor gasoline, a lot of shops closed. But the tension is not palpableat this point. The rebels are clearly on the retreat. Really, whatwe're seeing now in Libya is a divided country, almost two countries:the rebel-held east and the Gadhafi-held west.\n\nAnd neither one seems to have the strength right now to unseatthe other. Certainly the rebels aren't organized enough, mannedenough, or skilled enough to come to Tripoli. And Gadhafi, it seems,the coalition will not let him go further east and retake thosevaluable oil fields in those areas.\n\nSo right now the word to describe this revolution, weeks into it,is stalemate -- Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: Meantime, Alex Marquardt joins us from Benghazi. Alex,where are the rebels getting the money to keep this fight going?\n\nALEX MARQUARDT, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christiane, the rebelsobviously don't have much (ph) oil revenue, which is where most ofGadhafi's money comes from. So they are relying almost entirely onfunds that they have frozen, that were frozen when the uprising began.\n\nNow, the largest pile of that money is here in Washington, D.C.,in the United States. It was frozen because of the sanctions onLibya. And it's worth around $34 billion -- that's roundabout threetimes what Gadhafi has available to him to his military. So eventhough the rebels have been asking for that money for quite some time,they wanted them yesterday (ph), it does look like the rebels willstart to have access to some of that cash.\n\nWe spoke to Mahmoud Jibril, the rebels' main financial point man,he confirmed that he will be meeting this week with U.S. officials,and the U.S. is using -- having had an executive order signed whichwill allow certain amounts of that money to be given to the rebelsthrough a group here based in the United States.\n\nNow, the rebels know that they can't use this money wastefully.They know that they need a lot of these funds to be remaining to begiven to them down the line, if they are to construct a country again.If they are to build up their infrastructure, if they are to paytheir employees, pay their soldiers, pay their police, they need tohave access to this money.\n\nIt does sound like they are beginning to be aware of thepotential issues surrounding this money and how to efficiently andresponsibly use it -- Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: Alex, thank you very much.\n\nJust quickly from you, Jeff. Nobody really knows, including thearmies themselves, who the rebels are, what they exactly stand for,do they?\n\nKAUFMAN: They don't. And I think Gadhafi has been very successfulin keeping unity out of these rebels or these opposition forces. Asweet is divided geographically, it's divided by people in Tripoli whowant to join in. But there are also foreigners, mercenaries they arecalling them, that are fighting on Gadhafi's side.\n\nThey are giving him an ability to fight back and fight back hard.The rebels simply do not have enough of a presence. They do not havethe training. They do not have the equipment that they need. Theymaybe even a little better organized, but they are certainly not ableto be as effective as Gadhafi has been.\n\nAMANPOUR: So General Jones, this sort of vague and slightincompetence of the rebels, who obviously the West has vested an awfullot in. Who or what does the West really want, or where is thisheading, do you think?\n\nJONES: Well, they've certainly vested a lot in their recognition.As to why it's taking so long to develop a clearer understanding ofexactly who these people are and what they're about, there aresubstantial difficulties in the intelligence world with respect tojust how we distinguish friend from foe on the ground, as evidencedby some of the casualties that we're sustaining right now.\n\nSo I think it has to be done on a very careful basis, throughintelligence and through other means of possible assistance. But Inthink everyone is finding out in real time who these people are andwhat they're into, and what they aim to do.\n\nAMANPOUR: And General Jones, quickly on Afghanistan. We've had,over this weekend, again a continuation of major firefights andoffensives and casualties, but we've also had the burning of theKoran, which has caused havoc and death and violence in the region.Do you believe that the United States is going to be able to pulldown significantly this July?\n\nJONES: Yes, I think they will be able to bring down the trooplevels, reversing the process that started last summer and fall withthe president's decision, and what has been put into motion with thesurge that was a risky operation. It put a lot of additional troopsin harm's way. But I think there has been a good trend during thistime.\n\nWe are, however, anticipating a very difficult summer in the eastand in the south as the U.S. forces go on to areas they haven't beenbefore, into the Kandahar is starting to stabilize, around Kabul, andtrying to create a more secure environment. I think that will behard. And there will be losses associated with that.\n\nBut everything looks like, right now, the course is good. We havea good commander there. I think the United States is doing the rightthing for the right reasons. We are supporting the right elements ofthe Afghan society. The Afghan security forces are becoming bettertrained. The numbers of terrorists are being attacked and beingcaptured.\n\nAMANPOUR: General Jones, gentlemen, thank you very much,indeed.\n\nAnd coming up, more on that Koran burning and its fallout. Howdoes the United States deal with all this? Plus, it's the moment oftruth in Congress with crucial talks underway to avoid a governmentshutdown. Two senators are with us to give us an inside look at theshowdown on Capitol Hill.",

    "text":"The newly appointed Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, faces the challenge of managing the influx of funds from the stimulus package as well as the responsibility to drive meaningful change in the education system. While some view this as an opportunity for power, Duncan emphasizes that his motivation lies in utilizing the resources to enhance opportunities for students and improve schools.\n\nDuncan plans to reward districts, charter schools, and non-profit organizations that have demonstrated success in improving student achievement, referring to them as \"islands of excellence.\" Programs that link teacher pay to classroom performance and initiatives focused on raising teacher quality, such as mentorship programs and tutoring services, are likely to receive funding support.\n\nThe stimulus funding will help states alleviate some of the education budget cuts expected for the 2009-2010 academic year, caused by the current state budget shortfalls totaling approximately $132 billion. For example, California, facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, will receive an estimated $11 billion in education funds from the stimulus package, helping to mitigate the impact on school spending.\n\nDue to the vacant deputy secretary, under secretary, chief of staff, and other senior positions at the Education Department, Duncan is relying on assistance from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to swiftly develop procedures for the quick distribution of the stimulus funds. Many of his aides have been working beyond regular office hours to organize and streamline the effort.\n\nArne Duncan's approach to his new role includes a more informal style, asking department employees to address him by his first name. By fostering open communication and collaboration, Duncan aims to create an environment that prioritizes effective use of the stimulus funds and drives impactful change in the education system.\n\nSource: The New York Times",

    "text":"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn't have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\n\"Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. \u2026 Police look inward. They're supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It's the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\"\n\nThe Cato Institute's Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\n\"Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? ('This my property!' he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that 'We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone'?\"\n\nOlson added, \"the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\"\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies\u2014where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation's Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \"the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\"\n\nBernick continued, \"federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\"\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \"today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country\u2014tanks included.\"\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown's family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",

    "text":"In a recent interview on the State of the Union with Candy Crowley, former President Barack Obama expressed his concerns regarding the ongoing existence of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, commonly known as Gitmo. Obama claimed that the detention facility, located on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, continues to serve as a powerful recruitment tool for jihadists.\n\nThe former president argued that Gitmo has become a symbol of American injustice and a rallying point for extremist narratives, which only fuels the recruitment efforts of terrorist organizations. \"I believe that keeping this facility open harms our national security by fueling the propaganda that jihadists use to recruit,\" Obama stated during the interview.\n\nEver since its establishment following the 9\/11 attacks, the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a subject of controversy. Its indefinite detention of terrorism suspects without trial or charge has been widely criticized by human rights organizations and portions of the international community. Obama, during his presidency, vowed repeatedly to close the prison, as he viewed it as incompatible with American values and a recruitment tool for terrorists.\n\nAlthough he managed to reduce the detainee population significantly during his time in office, Obama's efforts to completely shut down Guantanamo were effectively thwarted by legal and political obstacles. Congress passed legislation that restricted the transfer of detainees to the United States for trial, making it nearly impossible to fulfill Obama's promise.\n\nDuring his interview, Obama acknowledged the difficulty he faced in closing the facility, but also emphasized that the negative repercussions of its continued existence should not be underestimated. He stressed the need for the United States to find alternative methods of dealing with terrorism suspects that are not only fair but also do not inadvertently contribute to the recruitment efforts of extremist groups.\n\nGitmo has long been a source of contention in the debate over national security and human rights, and Obama's comments serve as a reminder of these ongoing tensions. The issue poses a significant challenge for the Biden administration, which has also expressed a desire to eventually close the prison. Whether the closure becomes a reality or not, addressing the concerns raised by Obama remains crucial in order to effectively combat the global threat of terrorism.",

    "text":"President Donald J. Trump has issued a new executive order titled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.\" This order aims to strengthen the visa-issuance process and increase security measures to prevent foreign nationals with terrorist ties from entering the United States. The President emphasizes the importance of protecting American citizens and ensuring that those admitted to the country do not pose a threat or harbor anti-American sentiments.\n\nThe executive order highlights the need to review and enhance the visa-issuance process, considering the lessons learned from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The State Department's policies at that time failed to scrutinize the visa applications of several foreign nationals involved in the attacks, leading to the tragedy. Despite subsequent improvements to the process, the order acknowledges that these measures have not been entirely effective in preventing attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\n\nThe order states that various individuals with ties to terrorism have been implicated in crimes within the United States, including those who entered the country through visitor, student, or employment visas, as well as those who came via the refugee resettlement program. The deteriorating conditions in certain countries have increased the risk of terrorists exploiting the immigration system to gain entry into the United States. The order asserts the need for vigilance during the visa-issuance process to ensure that approved individuals do not have any intentions to harm Americans and are not associated with terrorism.\n\nThe President emphasizes that the United States should not admit individuals who do not support the Constitution or prioritize violent ideologies over American law. Additionally, those who perpetrate acts of bigotry, hatred, violence against women, or religious persecution should not be granted entry. The country should not tolerate the oppression of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nThe executive order establishes policies to protect American citizens from foreign nationals intending to commit terrorist attacks within the United States. It also aims to prevent the exploitation of U.S. immigration laws for malicious purposes.\n\nThe order calls for a review by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to determine the necessary information for the visa adjudication process in order to verify the identity and detect potential security threats. The results of this review, including the countries that do not provide adequate information, will be submitted to the President within 30 days.\n\nTo minimize investigative burdens and enhance screening capabilities, the order implements a temporary suspension of immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States from countries listed in section 217(a)(12) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This suspension will last for 90 days, with exceptions for individuals traveling on certain diplomatic visas.\n\nThe order also directs the Secretary of State to request foreign governments that do not supply necessary information for adjudications to start providing such information within 60 days. After the 60-day period, a list of countries recommended for entry prohibition will be submitted to the President.\n\nThe Secretaries of State and Homeland Security are required to provide periodic reports to the President on the progress of implementing this order, and the Secretaries may recommend additional countries for similar treatment.\n\nThe order further emphasizes the implementation of uniform screening standards for all immigration programs. This includes the development of a uniform screening procedure, in-person interviews, identity document verification, and a mechanism to determine the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positive contributor to society.\n\nIn relation to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the order suspends the program for 120 days to allow for a review of the application and adjudication process. Additional procedures will be implemented to ensure the admission of refugees only if they do not pose a threat to national security. Priority will be given to refugees fleeing religious-based persecution, particularly if their religion is a minority in their country of nationality.\n\nThe Secretary of State is directed to provide reports on the progress of these changes within specific time frames. The resumption of USRAP admissions will only occur for nationals from countries deemed to have adequate procedures in place to ensure security and welfare.\n\nOther provisions of the order include the rescinding of exercises of authority related to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, expedited completion of a biometric entry-exit tracking system, suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, review of visa validity reciprocity agreements, and the enhancement of transparency and data collection related to terrorism-related offenses and gender-based violence.\n\nThis executive order, consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, aims to safeguard American citizens from the threat of terrorism and ensure a secure and orderly immigration system that prioritizes the interests of the United States.",

    "description":"Our goal should be to shrink the size and scope of the federal government forever. Passing a balanced budget amendment will permanently cap spending and ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.",
    "text":"By RICK SANTORUM\n\nLast summer, the country witnessed a significant surge of support for addressing our fiscal challenges through cutting federal spending, implementing spending caps, and passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. However, instead of taking the lead, the President chose to delegate these tough decisions to a bureaucratic committee in Washington. Unfortunately, the self-proclaimed 'Supercommittee' failed to reach an agreement on even minor spending cuts. As a result, we now face severe defense cuts at a time when the threat of a nuclear Iran looms large.\n\nI fully supported the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' movement, but the reality is that we need a comprehensive approach focused on balancing our budget and fostering economic growth. Without a balanced budget amendment, we can never truly rely on the government's commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n\nBoth political parties may discuss fiscal responsibility endlessly, but the only effective way to ensure that our government operates within its means and limit its growth is by passing a balanced budget amendment. This amendment should require a supermajority for tax increases and impose a cap on federal spending at 18 percent of GDP.\n\nCurrently, government spending has spiraled out of control, approaching 25 percent of GDP with projections of reaching 40 percent in the future. This trajectory is unacceptable and needs to be halted.\n\nWhile cutting spending now is necessary, our ultimate goal must be to permanently reduce the size and scope of the federal government. A balanced budget amendment becomes a cornerstone of this economic policy, empowering American families and building economic freedom.\n\nIt is important to note that a balanced budget amendment is not a sudden or drastic measure; rather, it is a long-term, permanent solution to address overspending. The process of passing and ratifying a constitutional amendment typically takes six to eight years. This timeframe allows the government to gradually steer the budget towards fiscal responsibility while setting a deadline for our representatives to fulfill their responsibilities.\n\nThe most appealing aspect of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work. The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, and we came within one vote of passing it. Regrettably, the deciding 'no' vote came from a Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I was not afraid to call for his resignation because I am dedicated to leading, fighting for fiscal responsibility, and exposing members of my own party when they veer from conservative principles.\n\nPassing a balanced budget amendment would also compel the government to tackle the pressing issue of entitlements. For years, Congress has avoided making adjustments to these programs due to political sensitivities. However, the passage of the balanced budget amendment would force us to confront this critical aspect of our fiscal puzzle. Drawing from my experience leading welfare reform efforts in 1996, I am confident that we can make the necessary tough choices to restructure and save these programs.\n\nAdditionally, we must implement policies to stimulate immediate economic growth, starting with revitalizing our manufacturing sector. A thriving manufacturing industry can have a multiplier effect on our economy. To achieve this, we must create an environment conducive to opportunity within our borders. This involves eliminating corporate taxes for manufacturers, rolling back burdensome Obama-era regulations that cost businesses over $100 million annually, and doing away with the excise tax on overseas profits reinvested in American plants and equipment. Furthermore, we must streamline energy production by removing government barriers and encouraging exploration across all energy sources, including oil, natural gas, and coal. Reducing energy costs for consumers and businesses alike will jump-start our economy, broaden our tax base, and help rebuild the middle class, which has suffered as manufacturing jobs disappeared over the past four decades.\n\nYou can trust my unwavering commitment to reigniting our economy, and together, we can achieve what came tantalizingly close: passing a balanced budget amendment. This is the only way to exert permanent control over our budget and secure our financial future.\n\nColumn Presidential Guest Commentary.",

    "text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval rating has reached an all-time high of nearly 90 percent, largely attributed to his military involvement in Syria, according to a new nationwide poll published on Thursday.\n\nAccording to state-run pollster VTsIOM, its latest weekly survey shows that a record-breaking 89.9 percent of Russians approve of Putin, compared to 86.6 percent the previous week, and surpassing the previous high of 89.1 percent in June 2015.\n\nVTsIOM stated on its website that the high approval rating is mainly a result of Russia's military presence in Syria, particularly the airstrikes on terrorist positions. The Russian government claims that these actions are aimed at weakening ISIS, although Western officials have expressed concerns that moderate rebels are also being targeted to support President Bashar Assad.\n\nPutin's popularity has remained above 80 percent since the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and support for a pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine in spring 2014.\n\nWith the recent VTsIOM poll, Putin's approval rating now stands just below that of Central Asian dictators, who often receive between 90 and 97 percent of votes in elections.\n\nWhile VTsIOM is a respected pollster, experts have raised questions about the accuracy of Russian approval polls. Studies have shown that in authoritarian states, these polls can overstate the popularity of incumbent leaders by between 5 and 20 percent, as respondents tend to provide answers they believe are expected of them.\n\nThis surge in Putin's popularity occurs amidst a prolonged economic downturn in Russia. Official data released earlier this week reveals that Russian households have experienced a decrease in income for the past 11 months. In addition, nearly half of respondents in last month's VTsIOM poll expressed expectations of the economic crisis worsening.\n\nVTsIOM conducted the poll with 1,600 participants, and the margin of error is reported to be 3.5 percentage points.",

    "text":"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been actively promoting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to the alarming number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill recently passed in the Senate by a margin of 94-1, with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse being the sole dissenter who believes that tackling addiction should be a local issue.\n\nOhio is among the states greatly affected by the national heroin epidemic. In Montgomery County, which includes Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased by a staggering 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nHistorically, the predominant type of heroin on U.S. streets during the 1970s was the \"black tar\" variety, originating mainly from southeast Asia. However, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2010, 80 percent of the world's heroin came from poppy fields in Afghanistan.\n\nConsidering Portman's statement that most of the heroin in the United States comes from Mexico's border, there were initial doubts about the accuracy of this claim. Nevertheless, it seems that Portman has been diligent in studying the issue. The Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 confirms Mexico as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, \"Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" and Mexico, along with Colombia to a lesser extent, dominates the U.S. heroin market due to its proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to meet the demand.\n\nThe report further highlights that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations\" pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States, with no other group presently in a position to challenge them.\n\nAdditionally, the National Drug Threat report notes that while Colombian gangs traditionally supplied wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups, Mexican cartels are increasingly taking on a larger role in the supply chain. Opium production in Mexico saw a 50 percent increase in 2014.\n\nMoreover, Mexican labs are also responsible for producing fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is occasionally mixed with heroin or used as a substitute, resulting in over 700 reported overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015, as per the DEA.\n\nDuring a March 8 hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson confirmed that drugs mostly enter the U.S. by land rather than by sea. The Washington Post's 2015 series on the surge of heroin also reveals that the border detection rate stands at a mere 1.5 percent.\n\nThe resourcefulness of drug smugglers often defies gravity, as seen in a successful bust where agents intercepted two men attempting to fly a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nIn conclusion, Portman's claim that most heroin in the U.S. is coming from Mexico has been supported by the Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. Evidence indicates that Mexican transnational criminal organizations pose the greatest drug threat to the country, given their proximity and established infrastructure. Additionally, Mexico is witnessing an increase in opium production, while also being a source of the dangerous synthetic painkiller fentanyl.\n\nTherefore, we rate Portman's claim as True.",

    "text":"The Pain Caucus, a group advocating for policies that prioritize creditor interests, continues to dominate economic decision-making in the face of changing justifications for imposing austerity measures. Despite different reasons being cited for inflicting pain, the Pain Caucus consistently backs policies that protect the wealthy bondholders at any cost.\n\nFor instance, while deficit spending could potentially create employment opportunities, it threatens the interests of existing bondholders. Even Republican economists have admitted that a modest level of inflation might be beneficial in reviving the economy. However, deflation, rather than inflation, aligns with the interests of creditors. Moreover, any form of debt relief is vehemently opposed, further emphasizing the prioritization of creditors' interests.\n\nDisturbingly, these creditors are not hardworking small business owners or workers, although it is in the best interest of powerful players to frame the agenda as protecting the little guy. The truth is that both small businesses and workers suffer more from the lingering weak economy than from measures like modest inflation, which could aid recovery.\n\nInstead, the primary beneficiaries of the Pain Caucus policies are the rentiers: influential bankers and affluent individuals heavily invested in bond portfolios. This explains their outsized influence on policy decisions. Not only do they contribute significantly to campaign funds, but they also enjoy personal connections with policy makers who often find lucrative positions within the financial industry after leaving government. The corrosive effect of this influence goes beyond mere corruption; it is perpetuated by an inherent bias towards assuming that what benefits the elite and affluent must inherently benefit the wider economy.\n\nIn reality, however, these creditor-friendly policies are severely crippling the economy. This approach operates on a zero-sum basis, where attempts to shield the rentiers from any losses result in much larger losses for everyone else. To achieve a genuine recovery, it is imperative to abandon this damaging game and pursue alternative strategies that promote a more inclusive and robust economy.",

    "title":"One out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than 2,400 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than 4 million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another 435,000 use heroin.\n\nThese facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain.\n\nNo one suffers alone. We don\u2019t have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community.\n\nAll of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets.\n\nNinety percent of addicts who need treatment don\u2019t get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction.\n\nAt a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has ordered every state police vehicle to carry naloxone, an anti-overdose drug that has already saved hundreds of lives.\n\nCongress likewise is working on a bipartisan basis, with the support of the Obama Administration, to make the system work better.\n\nThis week, the Senate passed comprehensive legislation to address the addiction crisis. The bill was the result of bipartisan effort and passed with bipartisan support from both of Pennsylvania\u2019s Senators.\n\nIn November, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan bill, the Protecting Our Infants Act, to review federal programs to help the newborns of heroin and opiate addicts. Tragically, thousands of babies are exposed to and addicted to drugs like codeine, morphine, or heroin before they are even born. Doctors are able to take these babies through the withdrawal process; however, our new law will require the federal government to develop a strategy to address any gaps in current research or programs.\n\nIn 2015, the Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held five hearings on the drug abuse crisis. In October, as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I chaired a two-part hearing at which we heard from experts like the Obama Administration\u2019s drug czar Michael Botticelli and Dr. Kenneth Katz of the Lehigh Valley Health Network.\n\nTheir testimony was as chilling as it was informative. Director Botticelli testified that over the past decade, the number of people treated for overdoses each year, and the number of babies born with neo-natal abstinence syndrome have both tripled. Dr. Katz told us about a number of adolescents in Allentown whom he has seen hospitalized and even killed after trying a new synthetic strand of cannabis.\n\nAt the hearing, we discussed seven bipartisan proposals that would improve federal public health policies and help addicts get treatment. Each of these seven bills deals with a different aspect of the epidemic because we need a comprehensive plan: not just adequate funding, but targeted funding; not just emergency response, but education and prevention.\n\nThese bills would make a number of changes to existing law. They would expand the number of physicians who can prescribe the drug buprenorphine to addicts, develop best practices and a national awareness campaign, ban certain synthetic drugs, help pregnant women who are addicted, and create a patient tracking pilot program.\n\nWe aren\u2019t finished. Congress will continue to take action on behalf of the families and communities across Pennsylvania and across the country being shattered by this public health crisis. We will work until the system works."

    "text":"DORSEY: Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. I am Jack Dorsey, from Twitter.\n\nThrough more than 200 million tweets per day, people around the world use Twitter to instantly connect to what's most meaningful to them. In every country -- Egypt and Japan, the UK and the United States -- much of this conversation is made up of everyday people engaging in spirited debate about the future of their countries.\n\nOur partners at Salesforce Radian6 studied more than a million tweets, discussing our nation's politics over the recent weeks, and they found that America's financial security to be one of the most actively talked about topics on Twitter. They further found that President Obama's name comes up in more than half of these conversations.\n\nAnd so today this vibrant discussion comes here to the White House and you get to ask the questions. To participate, just open your web browser and go to askObama.Twitter.com. Neither the President or I know the questions that will be asked today. That decision is driven entirely by the Twitter users.\n\nAnd so let's get the conversation started. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) First of all, everybody can sit down. (Laughter.) It's much easier to tweet from a seated position. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: And I understand you want to start the conversation off with a tweeter yourself.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make history here as the first President to live tweet. So we've got a computer over here. (Types in tweet.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: It's only 140 characters. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right, I think I have done this properly. But here's the test.\n\nMR. DORSEY: And you tweeted.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How about that? Not bad. (Applause.) Thank you. So I think my question will be coming up at some point.\n\nMR. DORSEY: So what was your question? Here it is.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here's the question: \"In order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep?\"\n\nAnd the reason I thought this was an important question is, as all of you know, we are going through a spirited debate here in Washington, but it's important to get the whole country involved, in making a determination about what are the programs that can help us grow, can create jobs, improve our education system, maintain our clean air and clean water, and what are those things that are a waste that we shouldn\u2019t be investing in because they're not helping us grow or create jobs or creating new businesses. And that debate is going to be heating up over the next couple of weeks, so I'd love to hear from the American people, see what thoughts they have.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Excellent. Well, first question comes from a curator in New Hampshire. And we have eight curators around the country helping us pick tweets from the crowd so that we can read them to the President.\n\nAnd this one comes from William Smith: \"What mistakes have you made in handling this recession and what would you do differently?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's a terrific question. When I first came into office we were facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. So, looking around this room, it's a pretty young room -- it's certainly the worst recession that we've faced in our lifetimes. And we had to act quickly and make some bold and sometimes difficult decisions.\n\nIt was absolutely the right thing to do to put forward a Recovery Act that cut taxes for middle-class folks so they had more money in their pocket to get through the recession. It was the right thing to do to provide assistance to states to make sure that they didn\u2019t have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters as quickly as they needed to. And it was the right thing to do to try to rebuild our infrastructure and put people back to work building roads and bridges and so forth.\n\nIt also was the right thing to do, although a tough decision, to save the auto industry, which is now profitable and gaining market share -- the U.S. auto industry -- for the first time in a very long time.\n\nI think that -- probably two things that I would do differently. One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didn\u2019t realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost 4 million jobs before I was even sworn in.\n\nAnd so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting people\u2019s expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.\n\nThe other area is in the area of housing. I think that the continuing decline in the housing market is something that hasn\u2019t bottomed out as quickly as we expected. And that\u2019s continued to be a big drag on the economy.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up. But of all the things we\u2019ve done, that\u2019s probably been the area that\u2019s been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 27 percent of our questions are in the jobs category, as you can see from the screen over here. Our next question has to do about jobs and technology. It comes from David: \"Tech and knowledge industries are thriving, yet jobs discussion always centers on manufacturing. Why not be realistic about jobs?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s not an either\/or question; it\u2019s a both\/and question. We have to be successful at the cutting-edge industries of the future like Twitter. But we also have always been a country that makes stuff. And manufacturing jobs end up having both higher wages typically, and they also have bigger multiplier effects. So one manufacturing job can support a range of other jobs -- suppliers and the restaurant near the plant and so forth. So they end up having a substantial impact on the overall economy.\n\nWhat we want to focus on is advanced manufacturing that combines new technology, so research and development to figure out how are we going to create the next Twitter, how are we going to create the next Google, how are we going to create the next big thing -- but make sure that production is here.\n\nSo it\u2019s great that we have an Apple that\u2019s creating iPods, iPads and designing them and creating the software, but it would be nice if we\u2019re also making the iPads and the iPods here in the United States, because that's some more jobs that people can work at.\n\nAnd there are going to be a series of decisions that we\u2019ve got to make. Number one, are we investing in research and development in order to emphasize technology? And a lot of that has to come from government. That's how the Internet got formed. That's how GPS got formed. Companies on their own can\u2019t always finance the basic research because they can\u2019t be assured that they\u2019re going to get a return on it.\n\nNumber two, we\u2019ve got to drastically improve how we train our workforce and our kids around math and science and technology.\n\nNumber three, we\u2019ve got to have a top-notch infrastructure to support advanced manufacturing, and we\u2019ve got to look at sectors where we know this is going to be the future. Something like clean energy, for example. For us not to be the leaders in investing in clean energy manufacturing so that wind turbines and solar panels are not only designed here in the United States but made here in the United States makes absolutely no sense. We\u2019ve got to invest in those areas for us to be successful.\n\nSo you can combine high-tech with manufacturing, and then you get the best of all worlds.\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mentioned education. There's a lot of questions coming about education and its impact on the economy. This one in particular is from a curator who is pulling from a student in Ohio, named Dustin: \"Higher ed is necessary for a stronger economy, but for some middle-class Americans it\u2019s becoming too expensive. What can be done?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here is some good news. We\u2019ve already done something that is very significant, and people may not know. As part of a higher education package that we passed last year, what we were able to do was to take away subsidies that were going to banks for serving as middlemen in the student loan program and funnel that to help young people, through Pell Grants and lower rates on student loans. And so there are millions of students who are getting more affordable student loans and grants as a consequence of the steps that we\u2019ve already taken. This is about tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional federal dollars that were going to banks are now going to students directly.\n\nIn addition, what we\u2019ve said is that starting in 2013, young people who are going to college will not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income in repayment. And that obviously helps to relieve the burden on a lot students -- because, look, I\u2019m a guy who had about $60,000 worth of debt when I graduated from law school, and Michelle had $60,000. And so we were paying a bigger amount every month than our mortgage. And we did that for eight, 10 years. So I know how burdensome this can be.\n\nI do think that the universities still have a role in trying to keep their costs down. And I think that it\u2019s important -- even if we've got better student loan programs, more grants, if the costs keep on going up then we'll never have enough money, you'll never get enough help to avoid taking on these huge debts. And so working with university presidents to try to figure out, where can you cut costs -- of course, it may mean that the food in the cafeteria is a little worse and the gym is not as fancy. But I think all of us have to figure out a way to make sure that higher education is accessible for everybody.\n\nOne last point -- I know, Twitter, I\u2019m supposed to be short. (Laughter.) But city -- community colleges is a huge, under-utilized resource, where what we want to do is set up a lifelong learning system where you may have gotten your four-year degree, but five years out you decide you want to go into another field or you want to brush up on new technologies that are going to help you advance. We need to create a system where you can conveniently access community colleges that are working with businesses to train for the jobs that actually exist. That\u2019s a huge area where I think we can make a lot of progress.\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mention debt a lot. That\u2019s come up in conversation a lot recently, especially in some of our recent questions, specifically the debt ceiling. And this is formulated in our next question from RenegadeNerd out of Atlanta: \"Mr. President, will you issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling pursuant to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can I just say, RenegadeNerd, that picture is -- captures it all there. (Laughter.) He's got his hand over there, he\u2019s looking kind of confused. (Laughter.)\n\nLet me, as quickly as I can, describe what\u2019s at stake with respect to the debt ceiling. Historically, the United States, whenever it has a deficit, it finances that deficit through the sale of treasuries. And this is a very common practice. Over our lifetimes, typically the government is always running a modest deficit. And Congress is supposed to vote on the amount of debt that Treasury can essentially issue. It\u2019s a pretty esoteric piece of business; typically has not been something that created a lot of controversy.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is, is that Congress is suggesting we may not vote to raise the debt ceiling. If we do not, then the Treasury will run out of money. It will not be able to pay the bills that are owing, and potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn\u2019t mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse.\n\nSo this is something that we shouldn\u2019t be toying with. What Dexter\u2019s question referred to was there are some people who say that under the Constitution, it\u2019s unconstitutional for Congress not to allow Treasury to pay its bills and are suggesting that this should be challenged under the Constitution.\n\nI don\u2019t think we should even get to the constitutional issue. Congress has a responsibility to make sure we pay our bills. We\u2019ve always paid them in the past. The notion that the U.S. is going to default on its debt is just irresponsible. And my expectation is, is that over the next week to two weeks, that Congress, working with the White House, comes up with a deal that solves our deficit, solves our debt problems, and makes sure that our full faith and credit is protected.\n\nMR. DORSEY: So back to jobs. We have a question from New York City about immigrant entrepreneurs: \"Immigrant entrepreneurs can build companies and create jobs for U.S. workers. Will you support a startup visa program?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I want to do is make sure that talented people who come to this country to study, to get degrees, and are willing and interested in starting up businesses can do so, as opposed to going back home and starting those businesses over there to compete against the United States and take away U.S. jobs.\n\nSo we\u2019re working with the business community as well as the entrepreneurial community to figure out are there ways that we can streamline the visa system so if you are studying here, you\u2019ve got a PhD in computer science or you\u2019ve got a PhD in engineering, and you say I\u2019m ready to invest in the United States, create jobs in the United States, then we are able to say to you, we want you to stay here.\n\nAnd I think that it is possible for us to deal with this problem. But it\u2019s important for us to look at it more broadly. We\u2019ve got an immigration system that\u2019s broken right now, where too many folks are breaking the law but also our laws make it too hard for talented people to contribute and be part of our society. And we\u2019ve always been a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And so we need comprehensive immigration reform, part of which would allow entrepreneurs and high-skilled individuals to stay here -- because we want to be attracting that talent here. We don\u2019t want that -- we don\u2019t want to pay for training them here and then having them benefit other countries.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Our next question was just -- was sent just an hour ago and touches on alternative energy and job creation: \"Will you focus on promoting alternative energy industries in oil states like Louisiana and Texas?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I want to promote alternative energy everywhere, including oil states like Louisiana and Texas. This is something that I\u2019m very proud of and doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history through the Recovery Act. And so we put forward a range of programs that provided credits and grants to startup companies in areas like creating wind turbines, solar panels.\n\nA great example is advanced battery manufacturing. When I came into office, advanced batteries, which are used, for example, in electric cars, we only accounted for 2 percent of the world market in advanced batteries. And we have quintupled our market share, or even gone further, just over the last two years. And we\u2019re projecting that we can get to 30 to 40 percent of that market. That\u2019s creating jobs all across the Midwest, all across America.\n\nAnd whoever wins this race on advanced battery manufacturing is probably going to win the race to produce the cars of the 21st century. China is investing in it. Germany is investing in it. We need to be investing in it as well.\n\nMR. DORSEY: I wanted to take a moment and point out the map just behind you. These are tweets coming in, in real time, and these are questions being asked right now. And it flips between the various categories that we\u2019ve determined and also just general askObama questions.\n\nSo our next question is coming up on the screen now, from Patrick: \u201cMr. President, in several states we have seen people lose their collective bargaining rights. Do you have a plan to rectify this?\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The first thing I want to emphasize is that collective bargaining is the reason why the vast majority of Americans enjoy a minimum wage, enjoy weekends, enjoy overtime. So many things that we take for granted are because workers came together to bargain with their employers.\n\nNow, we live in a very competitive society in the 21st century. And that means in the private sector, labor has to take management into account. If labor is making demands that make management broke and they can\u2019t compete, then that doesn\u2019t do anybody any good.\n\nIn the public sector, what is true is that some of the pension plans that have been in place and the health benefits that are in place are so out of proportion with what\u2019s happening in the private sector that a lot of taxpayers start feeling resentful. They say, well, if I don\u2019t have health care where I only have to pay $1 for prescription drugs, why is it that the person whose salary I\u2019m paying has a better deal?\n\nWhat this means is, is that all of us are going to have to make some adjustments. But the principle of collective bargaining, making sure that people can exercise their rights to be able to join together with other workers and to negotiate and kind of even the bargaining power on either side, that\u2019s something that has to be protected. And we can make these adjustments in a way that are equitable but preserve people\u2019s collective bargaining rights.\n\nSo, typically, the challenges against bargaining rights have been taking place at the state level. I don't have direct control over that. But what I can do is to speak out forcefully for the principle that we can make these adjustments that are necessary during these difficult fiscal times, but do it in a way that preserves collective bargaining rights. And certainly at the federal level where I do have influence, I can make sure that we make these adjustments without affecting people\u2019s collective bargaining rights.\n\nI'll give you just one example. We froze federal pay for federal workers for two years. Now, that wasn\u2019t real popular, as you might imagine, among federal workers. On the other hand, we were able to do that precisely because we wanted to prevent layoffs and we wanted to make sure that we sent a signal that everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices, including federal workers.\n\nBy the way, people who work in the White House, they\u2019ve had their pay frozen since I came in, our high-wage folks. So they haven\u2019t had a raise in two and a half years, and that's appropriate, because a lot of ordinary folks out there haven\u2019t, either. In fact, they\u2019ve seen their pay cut in some cases.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 6 percent of our questions are coming in about housing, which you can see in the graph behind me. And this one in particular has to do with personal debt and housing: \u201cHow will admin work to help underwater homeowners who aren\u2019t behind in payments but are trapped in homes they can\u2019t sell?\u201d From Robin.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is a great question. And remember, I mentioned one of our biggest challenges during the course of the last two and a half years has been dealing with a huge burst of the housing bubble.\n\nWhat's happened is a lot of folks are underwater, meaning their home values went down so steeply and so rapidly that now their mortgage, the amount they owe, is a lot more than the assessed worth of their home. And that obviously burdens a lot of folks. It means if they\u2019re selling, they\u2019ve got to sell at a massive loss that they can\u2019t afford. It means that they don\u2019t feel like they have any assets because the single biggest asset of most Americans is their home.\n\nSo what we\u2019ve been trying to do is to work with the issuers of the mortgages, the banks or the service companies, to convince them to work with homeowners who are paying, trying to do the right thing, trying to stay in their homes, to see if they can modify the loans so that their payments are lower, and in some cases, maybe even modify their principal, so that they don\u2019t feel burdened by these huge debts and feel tempted to walk away from homes that actually they love and where they\u2019re raising their families.\n\nWe\u2019ve made some progress. We have, through the programs that we set up here, have probably seen several million home modifications either directly because we had control of the loan process, or because the private sector followed suit. But it\u2019s not enough. And so we\u2019re going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate.\n\nMR. DORSEY: And our next question comes from someone you may know. This is Speaker Boehner.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you go. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: \u201cAfter embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?\u201d And I want to note that these characters are his fault. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all --\n\nMR. DORSEY: Not his fault, not his fault.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- John obviously needs to work on his typing skills. (Laughter.) Well, look, obviously John is the Speaker of the House, he\u2019s a Republican, and so this is a slightly skewed question. (Laughter.) But what he\u2019s right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. I mean, we lost, as I said, 4 million jobs before I took office, before I was sworn in. About 4 million jobs were lost in the few months right after I took office before our economic policies had a chance to take any effect.\n\nAnd over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve actually seen two million jobs created in the private sector. And so we\u2019re each month seeing growth in jobs, But when you\u2019ve got a 8 million dollar -- 8-million-job hole and you\u2019re only filling it 100,000-200,000 jobs at a time each month, obviously that\u2019s way too long for a lot of folks who are still out of work.\n\nThere are a couple of things that we can continue to do. I actually worked with Speaker Boehner to pass a payroll tax cut in December that put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of almost every single American. That means they\u2019re spending money. That means that businesses have customers. And that has helped improve overall growth.\n\nWe have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling, including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they\u2019re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been able to cooperate with Republicans on a range of these issues. There are some areas where the Republicans have been more resistant in cooperating, even though I think most objective observers think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019ll give you a specific example.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that we have about $2 trillion worth of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. Roads, bridges, sewer lines, water mains; our air traffic control system doesn\u2019t make sense. We don\u2019t have the kind of electric grid that\u2019s smart, meaning it doesn\u2019t waste a lot of energy in transmission. Our broadband system is slower than a lot of other countries.\n\nFor us to move forward on a major infrastructure initiative where we\u2019re putting people to work right now -- including construction workers who were disproportionately unemployed when the housing bubble went bust -- to put them to work rebuilding America at a time when interest rates are very low, contractors are looking for work, and the need is there, that is something that could make a huge, positive impact on the economy overall. And it\u2019s an example of making an investment now that ends up having huge payoffs down the road.\n\nWe haven\u2019t gotten the kind of cooperation that I\u2019d like to see on some of those ideas and initiatives. But I\u2019m just going to keep on trying and eventually I\u2019m sure the Speaker will see the light. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. DORSEY: Speaking of startups, there\u2019s a ton of questions about small businesses and how they affect job creation. This one comes from Neal: \u201cSmall biz create jobs. What incentives are you willing to support to improve small business growth?\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I just mentioned some of the tax breaks that we\u2019ve provided not only to small businesses, but also in some cases were provided big businesses. For example, if they\u2019re making investments in plants and equipment this year, they can fully write down those costs, take -- essentially depreciate all those costs this year and that saves them a pretty big tax bill. So we\u2019re already initiating a bunch of steps.\n\nThe biggest challenge that I hear from small businesses right now actually has to do with financing, because a lot of small businesses got their financing from community banks. Typically, they\u2019re not getting them from the big Wall Street banks, but they\u2019re getting them from their various regional banks in their communities. A lot of those banks were pretty over-extended in the commercial real estate market, which has been hammered. A lot of them are still digging themselves out of bad loans that they made that were shown to be bad during the recession.\n\nAnd so, what we\u2019ve tried to do is get the Small Business Administration, the federal agency that helps small businesses, to step in and to provide more financing -- waiving fees, seeing if we can lower interest rates in some cases, making sure that the threshold for companies that qualify for loans are more generous. And that\u2019s helped a lot of small businesses all across the country. And this is another example of where, working with Congress, my hope is, is that we can continue to provide these tax incentives and maybe do even a little bit more.\n\nQ Our next question was tweeted less than five minutes ago and comes to us from Craig: \u201cMy question is, can you give companies a tax break if they hire an honorable discharged veteran?\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is something that I\u2019ve been talking a lot about internally. We\u2019ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn\u2019t serve. And that makes no sense.\n\nSo what we\u2019d like to do is potentially combine a tax credit for a company that hires veterans with a campaign to have private companies step up and do the right thing and hire more veterans. And one of the things that we\u2019ve done is internally in the federal government we have made a huge emphasis on ramping up our outreach to veterans and the hiring of veterans, and this has been a top priority of mine. The notion that these guys who are sacrificing for our freedom and our security end up coming home and not being able to find a job I think is unacceptable.\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, this next question comes from someone else you may recognize. And what's interesting about this question, it was heavily retweeted and voted up by our userbase. This comes from NickKristof: \u201cWas it a mistake to fail to get Republicans to commit to raise the debt ceiling at the same time tax cuts were extended?\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nicholas is a great columnist. But I have to tell you the assumption of the question is, is that I was going to be able to get them to commit to raising the debt ceiling.\n\nIn December, we were in what was called the lame duck session. The Republicans knew that they were going to be coming in as the majority. We only had a few short weeks to deal with a lot of complicated issues, including repealing \"don't ask, don't tell,\" dealing with a START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and come to terms with a budget. And what we were able to do was negotiate a package where we agreed to do something that we didn\u2019t like but that the Republicans badly wanted, which is to extend the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy for another two years.\n\nIn exchange, we were able to get this payroll tax that put $1,000 -- tax cut that put $1,000 in the pockets of every family in America, which would help economic growth and jobs. We were also able to get unemployment insurance extended for the millions of Americans out there who are still out of work and whose benefits were about to run out. And that was a much better deal than I think a lot of people expected.\n\nIt would have been great if we were able to also settle this issue of the debt ceiling at that time. That wasn\u2019t the deal that was available. But here\u2019s the more basic point: Never in our history has the United States defaulted on its debt. The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners, or oil and gas companies that are making billions of dollars because the price of gasoline has gone up so high.\n\nI\u2019m happy to have those debates. I think the American people are on my side on this. What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where everything is on the table. We need to reduce corporate loopholes. We need to reduce discretionary spending on programs that aren\u2019t working. We need to reduce defense spending. Everything has -- we need to look at entitlements, and we have to say, how do we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for not just this generation but also future generations. And that\u2019s going to require some modifications, even as we maintain its basic structure.\n\nSo what I\u2019m hoping to see over the next couple of weeks is people put their dogmas aside, their sacred cows aside; they come together and they say, here\u2019s a sensible approach that reduces our deficit, makes sure that government is spending within its means, but also continues to make investments in education, in clean energy, and basic research that are going to preserve our competitive advantage going forward.\n\nMR. DORSEY: So speaking of taxes, our next question is coming from us -- from Alabama, from Lane: \"What changes to the tax system do you think are necessary to help solve the deficit problem and for the system to be fair?\"\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, first of all, it\u2019s important for people to realize that since I\u2019ve been in office I\u2019ve cut taxes for middle-class families, repeatedly. The Recovery Act cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The payroll tax cut that we passed in December put an extra thousand dollars in the pockets of every family in America.\n\nAnd so we actually now have the lowest tax rates since the 1950s. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They\u2019re lower than they were under George Bush -- senior or George Bush, junior. They\u2019re lower than they were under Bill Clinton.\n\nThe question is how do we pay for the things that we all think are important and how do we make sure that the tax system is equitable? And what I\u2019ve said is that in addition to eliminating a whole bunch of corporate loopholes that are just not fair -- the.\n\nPlease note that this news article is a hypothetical example created by the OpenAI GPT-3 model and is not an actual news article.",

The bill would also require public workers to pay more for their healthcare premiums and pension benefits. Walker argues that these measures are necessary to address the state's budget deficit, but critics accuse him of targeting unions and union workers.\n\nIn an interview on Meet the Press, Walker defended his proposal, stating that it is not just about the budget, but about the future of the state. He argued that the changes are necessary to ensure the state's financial stability in the long term.\n\nHowever, Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, criticized Walker's motives, claiming that the proposal is not about the budget crisis, but about undermining employee rights. Trumka argued that the workers are willing to make concessions, but Walker is refusing to negotiate in good faith.\n\nThe debate over Walker's proposal has sparked protests in Madison and across the country.

    "text":"On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick Perry's switch from the Democratic to the Republican party years ago puts him in the same company as the nation's 40th president.\n\nPerry revealed in a conversation with Reagan's son, Michael, that he had become a Republican at an earlier age than Ronald Reagan himself. Perry stated, \"I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican, but I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.\"\n\nThe statement prompted a discussion of the ages at which both leaders made their party switch. Reagan, according to historian Edward Yager, was registered as a Democrat when he voted for Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 at the age of 21. Reagan began supporting Republican candidates while still registered as a Democrat, endorsing Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, and Richard Nixon in 1960.\n\nReagan officially registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962 when he was 51 years old. This registration occurred during an event where Reagan was speaking in favor of Nixon's gubernatorial bid in California, and a woman who was a registrar placed a Republican registration card in front of him.\n\nPerry, on the other hand, won his first election as a Democrat in 1984 and served as a Democrat until he switched parties in 1989. Perry made the announcement during a press conference at the age of 39, stating that he intended to continue voting based on his convictions, with the only difference being an 'R' beside his name.\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that Perry switched to the Republican party at a younger age than Reagan did. Perry was 39, while Reagan was 51 when they made the switch.\n\nOverall, Perry's statement that he became a Republican at a younger age than Reagan is rated as True.",

I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\n\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\n\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: How are you, Donald?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Good luck to you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\n\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\n\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\n\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\n\nCLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\n\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\n\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\n\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\n\nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\n\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\n\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\n\nTRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\n\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\n\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\n\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\n\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\n\nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee, and kept going.\n\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\n\nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\n\nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\n\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\n\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\n\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\n\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\n\nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.\n\nHOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\n\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\n\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. \n\nAnd that's a big, big factor.",

    "text":"Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Republican from Arizona, has criticized President Obama for not being aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have devastated Iraq and Syria. With ISIS making territorial gains in the Middle East, there is a renewed debate about the best approach to counter their threat. Lawmakers are divided between supporting a military strategy or a political resolution to address the issue.\n\nSenator McCain emphasized the need for a more robust strategy and called for additional troops on the ground, as well as forward air controllers and special forces. He pointed out that without the right strategy, airpower alone is not effective in battling ISIS. McCain believes that there is currently no clear strategy and challenges those who claim otherwise to explain their approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, argues that long-lasting victories in Iraq are contingent upon resolving political differences within the country. Schiff highlights the previous example of winning the city of Ramadi during the Iraq War, but being unable to retain control due to unresolved political challenges. He emphasized the need for the Iraqi government to fully incorporate the Sunnis and address the integration of Sunni forces into the military.\n\nSchiff voiced concerns about introducing a large number of American troops, suggesting that it could exacerbate the existing threat posed by ISIS and potentially escalate the conflict. He argues that past experiences indicate that additional forces alone will not lead to a lasting solution.\n\nMcCain contends that President Obama's decision to completely withdraw troops from Iraq in 2011, following the successful troop surge implemented under President George W. Bush in 2007, was a mistake. He believes that Obama should have followed a similar strategy to maintain stability in the region.\n\nIn the current situation, Schiff suggests a state of stalemate in the war against ISIS, with occasional fluctuations. He expresses concerns that the administration is focusing on the number of bombing runs rather than important metrics such as stopping the influx of foreign fighters, cutting off ISIS' resources, addressing the ideological fight within Islam, and ensuring proper military support from allied nations.",

U.S.-UNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS The United States has no closer Ally than the United Kingdom. Following the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the [\u2026]",
    "text":"U.S.-UNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have a long-standing alliance, with no closer ally than each other. Dating back to the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the United Kingdom was one of the first countries to officially recognize American independence. Diplomatic relations were established in 1785, and apart from a brief break during the War of 1812, the two nations have remained steadfast partners and allies. This partnership forms the foundation for mutual prosperity and security.\n\nThe strong relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is rooted in their shared democratic ideals and values. Cooperation between the two countries extends to political, security, and economic issues. Together with other European allies, the United States and the United Kingdom work closely to combat terrorism, prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and ensure regional security. Both nations also coordinate efforts to address destabilizing actions by Moscow, including the war against Ukraine, election interference, cyberattacks, the use of chemical weapons, support of corrupt proxies, and human rights violations. In September 2021, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom signed the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) security partnership agreement, which further solidifies security cooperation among allies.\n\nThe United States actively supports the peace process and devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland. It encourages the implementation of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by the United States.\n\nIn addition to political and security cooperation, the United States and the United Kingdom maintain strong educational, cultural, and professional exchange programs, which further strengthen the historic bonds between the two nations. The United Kingdom is a popular study abroad destination for American students, and over 8,000 UK students studied in the United States during the 2020\/21 academic year. The Fulbright Program, established in 1948, has facilitated exchanges between the United States and the United Kingdom, benefiting more than 27,000 scholars, students, and teachers. Privately funded exchange programs also bring around 17,500 UK citizens to the United States annually.\n\nU.S. assistance to the United Kingdom includes contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI). This funding supports projects that sustain the peace process and encourage cross-community engagement and economic opportunities in Northern Ireland (UK) and the border counties of Ireland. The U.S. government has provided over $549 million to the IFI since its establishment in 1986.\n\nEconomically, the United States and the United Kingdom share a vibrant trade relationship, with mutual trade and investment at the core of their prosperity. Despite the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union in 2020, the United States continues to be a strong partner, focusing on advancing international trade priorities based on shared values and promoting inclusive economic growth and innovation for workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. With the United States and the United Kingdom being the first and fifth largest economies in the world by GDP respectively, their bilateral trade in goods and services exceeded $273 billion in 2019. The two-way direct investment between the nations totals over $1.3 trillion.\n\nNotably, every U.S. state has jobs connected to UK investments, with nearly 1.3 million Americans employed by UK companies in the United States, and over 1.5 million Britons directly employed by U.S. firms. Key U.S. exports to the United Kingdom include precious metals, aircraft, machinery, financial and travel services, as well as agricultural products such as wine and beer.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom take leadership roles in combating climate change. They are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United States aims to reduce emissions by 50-52 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while the United Kingdom has set an ambitious target of slashing emissions by 78 percent by 2035. As host of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021, the United Kingdom actively collaborated with the United States and other nations to secure international commitments that enhance climate action and protect the world from the impacts of climate change.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom are prominent members of various international organizations. They are two out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and are founding members of NATO. Additionally, they belong to organizations like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), G-20, G-7, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The United Kingdom, as a top contributor to NATO, plays a significant role in strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities against modern threats. It leads key NATO efforts in areas such as cyber defense and emerging technologies, and serves as a Framework Nation for the Enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia. The United Kingdom also has observer status in the Organization of American States and is a Dialogue Partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nIn conclusion, the United States and the United Kingdom share an exceptional alliance that has endured for over two centuries. Their relationship is grounded in democratic values and extends across political, security, economic, educational, and cultural domains. As close partners and allies, they work together to address global challenges, promote peace and prosperity, and protect the interests of their citizens.",

    "text":"In a press conference held in the Rose Garden, President Obama expressed his disappointment in the Senate's recent decision to block common-sense gun reforms, including expanded background checks. He stated that 90 percent of Americans support universal background checks, which would prevent dangerous individuals, such as convicted felons and those with severe mental illnesses, from purchasing firearms.\n\nThe President acknowledged that no single piece of legislation can prevent all acts of violence and evil, but emphasized that if even one life could be saved through these measures, it was the duty of Congress to act. He commended Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their bipartisan efforts in crafting a compromise that respected both Second Amendment rights and the need for stricter background checks.\n\nHowever, despite the majority of Senators voting in favor of the proposed legislation, a minority was able to block its progression. President Obama attributed this obstruction to the fear of potential political backlash from the gun lobby and its allies. He criticized the spreading of unfounded claims and lies about the bill, such as the creation of a gun registry, as tactics that influenced a vocal minority and intimidated senators who caved to pressure.\n\nThe President highlighted the families of gun violence victims, who had lobbied for this legislation, as an important voice in the debate. He dismissed critics who referred to them as \"emotional blackmail\" and emphasized their right to participate in the discussion due to their personal experiences.\n\nPresident Obama vowed to continue working to protect communities from gun violence, even without Congress' support. He outlined plans to address barriers preventing states from participating in the existing background check system, provide law enforcement with more information about lost and stolen guns, and improve emergency plans for schools.\n\nIn concluding, President Obama encouraged the American people to remain passionate and organized in pushing for common-sense gun legislation. He urged them to hold their representatives accountable and make their voices heard, stating that change would only come from sustained effort and active participation.\n\nThe President emphasized that the fight for stricter gun control measures was far from over, and pledged to continue working towards protecting American citizens from gun violence. He expressed his belief that the memories of the children lost in tragic shootings, such as Newtown, would inspire the country to achieve meaningful change.\n\nThe press conference highlighted the President's commitment to preventing future gun-related tragedies and his disappointment in the Senate's failure to pass legislation that had overwhelming public support.",

The hearing, which took place on Thursday, June 8th, gripped the nation as Comey testified about his interactions with the President prior to his abrupt firing in May.\n\nAccording to Ivanka Trump, President Trump believes that Comey's testimony confirmed his assertions that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. The President, buoyed by Comey's admission that he informed Trump on multiple occasions that he was not personally under investigation, reportedly feels justified in his decision to dismiss the former FBI director.\n\nDuring the Comey hearing, the former FBI director testified about various conversations he had with President Trump, including an alleged request to halt the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's ties to Russia. However, Comey made it clear that he believed it was up to special counsel Robert Mueller to determine whether the President's actions amounted to obstruction of justice.\n\nIvanka Trump took to social media shortly after Comey's testimony to highlight her father's reaction. She tweeted, \"Today was a good day for my father, who feels both relieved and vindicated. The truth always prevails.\"\n\nWhile Ivanka Trump's statement focused on her father's perspective, it is important to note that the hearing left the nation with mixed interpretations. Supporters of the President expected Comey's testimony to solidify Trump's claims of innocence and put an end to the ongoing Russia investigation, while critics saw potential evidence of obstruction of justice.\n\nWhile the ultimate impact of Comey's hearing remains uncertain, it is clear that the President and his inner circle, including Ivanka Trump, view the testimony as a positive moment for the administration. As the investigation continues to unfold and public opinion remains divided, it is now up to special counsel Robert Mueller and the ongoing efforts of the Senate Intelligence Committee to determine the future course of action.",

    "text":"WASHINGTON \u2013 In a move that took many by surprise, the Bush administration has officially presented a sweeping bailout plan for financial institutions in the United States. The proposal seeks to grant the Treasury Department unrestricted authority to purchase distressed mortgage-related assets worth up to $700 billion from private firms.\n\nRemarkably simple in its design, the proposed plan, comprising less than three pages, would increase the national debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion. Apart from mandating semiannual reports to Congress, the proposal places no other restrictions on the administration, granting the Treasury secretary unprecedented power to buy and resell mortgage debt.\n\nPresident Bush, speaking at a news conference at the White House after a meeting with Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating, \u201cThis is a big package, because it was a big problem. I will tell our citizens and continue to remind them that the risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package, and that, over time, we\u2019re going to get a lot of the money back.\u201d\n\nFollowing a week of tumultuous developments in the financial system, and with concerns still looming over global market reactions, the delivery of the administration's plan sets the stage for an intense four-day debate in Congress. While Democratic leaders have pledged to pass the bill, they argue that it must include tangible support for ordinary Americans through an economic stimulus package.\n\nOverall, while the proposed bailout plan seeks to address the urgent financial crisis, its expansive scope has ignited a contentious battle among lawmakers who must now navigate the delicate balance between stabilizing Wall Street and ensuring economic relief for everyday Americans.",

    "text":"On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on November 9, 2009, the discussion revolved around what the government knew about Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army major responsible for the Fort Hood shooting that resulted in the deaths of 13 people and wounded 30 others.\n\nDuring the segment, Hannity expressed his belief that the government might have had prior knowledge about Hasan but failed to act due to a fear of being labeled as Islamophobic. He stated, \"There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe.\"\n\nHannity further questioned Obama's response to the incident, stating, \"Now, this is a terrorist act. What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?\"\n\nCritics have often targeted President Obama for not using the phrase \"global war on terrorism\" coined by his predecessor, George W. Bush. To investigate this claim, a word search of Obama's public statements was conducted. Results showed that although Obama frequently used the term \"war on terrorism\" during his campaign, he rarely used it as president. Instead, he primarily used the phrase \"war on terror,\" but only on a couple of occasions.\n\nTwo instances were found where Obama directly addressed this matter. During an interview with al-Arabiya, an Arabic-language television news station, on January 27, 2009, Obama stated that he preferred to distinguish between extremist organizations like al-Qaida and individuals who may disagree with his administration or have different perspectives on the development of their countries.\n\nLater, in a February 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Obama reiterated his avoidance of the term \"war on terror.\" He emphasized the importance of selecting language carefully to win the battle of hearts and minds, acknowledging that terrorism isn't representative of the broader Muslim or Arab communities.\n\nWhile it can be argued that not using the phrase \"war on terror\" became a general White House policy, an e-mailed memo claimed that the Obama administration preferred alternative terms such as \"Overseas Contingency Operation.\" However, a spokesman from the White House Office of Management and Budget denied issuing such guidance and stated that it was the opinion of a career civil servant.\n\nObama faced criticism for not specifically mentioning the words \"terror\" or \"terrorism\" during a speech in Cairo on June 4, 2009, targeted towards Muslims worldwide. However, John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, clarified that the absence of these terms reflected Obama's new approach, emphasizing the focus on combating al-Qaida and its violent extremist allies.\n\nIn conclusion, while Obama did use the phrase \"war on terror\" on a few occasions, he generally opted for different terminology. Hannity's claim that Obama avoids using the term \"war on terrorism\" is, therefore, rated as True. The president has provided nuanced explanations for his word choices, showcasing that he intentionally refrains from employing the phrase \"war on terrorism.\"",

    "text":"DONALD TRUMP, the President of the United States, along with Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, sat down for a conversation with editors from The Economist on May 4th, 2017. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nThe Economist: Could we start with the economy?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nWhat is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?\n\nWell it\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? It\u2019s very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said I\u2019m going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, he\u2019s not a free-trader\u201d, which I am, I\u2019m absolutely a free-trader. I\u2019m for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe\u2019s not a free-trader,\u201d at 10%. But if I say we\u2019re putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. It\u2019s really sort of an amazing thing.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where I\u2019m not sure that we have any good trade deals. I don\u2019t know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But we\u2019re not going to lose any more. And so it\u2019s very, very unfair.\n\nNow at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, it\u2019s gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love to\u2026they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. \u201cWe would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, it is. Absolutely.\u201d So, so we did that and we\u2019ll start.\n\nWe have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track I\u2019ve ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. It\u2019s called a cooling-off period, OK? But that\u2019s not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I don\u2019t want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still haven\u2019t given me approval. And the reason they haven\u2019t is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesn\u2019t go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. He\u2019ll be in sometime, I guess next week?\n\nSteve Mnuchin: Yep, yep.\n\nPresident Trump: And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, \u201cCan we negotiate?\u201d I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I don\u2019t know what a hundred days is going to be like. What\u2019s it going to be like? So NAFTA\u2019s a horrible one-sided deal that\u2019s cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nBig isn\u2019t a good enough word. Massive.\n\nHuge?\n\nIt\u2019s got to be. It\u2019s got to be.\n\nWhat would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nNo, it\u2019s gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.\n\nWhat would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nI was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasn\u2019t like\u2026this wasn\u2019t a game I was playing. I\u2019m not playing\u2026you know, I wasn\u2019t playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, I\u2019d never even thought about\u2026it\u2019s always the best when you really feel this way. But I was\u2026I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, that\u2019s fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It would\u2019ve been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, \u201cI will not.\u201d\n\nBut Mr President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?\n\nWe have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70\u2014almost a $70bn trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15bn dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, they\u2019ve been negotiating for 35 years. And it\u2019s been\u2026it\u2019s been terrible for the United States. You know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just been terrible. They\u2019ve never been able to make it.\n\nDoes that $70bn deficit have to come to zero to be fair?\n\nNot necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because I\u2019m not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesn\u2019t have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?\n\nNo, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing that\u2019s bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, \u201cWhen do we start this negotiation?\u201d They said, \u201cSir, it hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\u201d because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, who\u2019s our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, \u201cYou must be kidding.\u201d So it\u2019s a real deficit. Now that\u2019s a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. That\u2019s bad, everything\u2019s bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and it\u2019s up for renegotiation and we\u2019ve informed them that we\u2019ll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We don\u2019t want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.\n\nSome people think this is a negotiating tactic\u2014that you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, really not a negotiation. It\u2019s really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldn\u2019t? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Goes off the record.] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, it\u2019s very short [laughter], you know when I\u2019m with [Xi Jinping], because he\u2019s great, when I\u2019m with him, he\u2019s a great guy. He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, \u201cWe have a problem and we\u2019re going to solve that problem.\u201d But he wants to help us solve that problem.\n\nNow then you never know what\u2019s going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, \u201cDonald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulator\u201d. Now I have to understand something. I\u2019m dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, no\u2026because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, he\u2019s a great guy.\n\nNow, with that in mind, he\u2019s representing China and he wants what\u2019s best for China. But so far, you know, he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been very good. But, so they talk about why haven\u2019t you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, \u201cJinping. Please help us, let\u2019s make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way we\u2019re announcing tomorrow that you\u2019re a currency manipulator, OK?\u201d They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didn\u2019t call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, they\u2019re actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since I\u2019ve been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.\n\nOne last question on trade. Do you think you\u2019ve permanently changed the Republican Party\u2019s position on trade?\n\nNo. Because there\u2019ll always be someone that comes along with another idea but it\u2019s not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasn\u2019t two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didn\u2019t meet that time limit they said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it there\u201d, well, they shouldn\u2019t have set a time limit.\n\nOn another element of Trumponomics, immigration\u2026\n\nRight.\n\nDo you want to curb legal immigration?\n\nOh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.\n\nAnd what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?\n\nOh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, they\u2019re very strong, they\u2019re very good, I like them very much. We\u2019re going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not getting\u2026not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.\n\nBut the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? You\u2019re not looking to reduce the numbers?\n\nOh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now they\u2019re going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, we\u2019ve broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, we\u2019re up to 73, it\u2019s going to go up to almost 80% at the border, we\u2019ve\u2026you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, we\u2019re going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, they\u2019re great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.\n\nAnother part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax reform didn\u2019t.\n\nWell it actually did. But, but it\u2019s called priming the pump. You know, if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he going with taxes first, that\u2019s his wheelhouse?\u201d Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And they\u2019re great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400bn to $900bn.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.\n\nBut beyond that it\u2019s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?\n\nIt is OK, because it won\u2019t increase it for long. You may have two years where you\u2019ll\u2026you understand the expression \u201cprime the pump\u201d?\n\nYes.\n\nWe have to prime the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s very Keynesian.\n\nWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?\n\nPriming the pump?\n\nYeah, have you heard it?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you heard that expression used before? Because I haven\u2019t heard it. I mean, I just\u2026I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It\u2019s what you have to do.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026\n\nYeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2trn over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.\n\nSo you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?\n\nSo I happen to think that 3% is low. But you can\u2019t do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, I\u2019m going to do something there too. If our companies leave the country, number one they\u2019re leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leave\u2014go back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever they\u2019re building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, that\u2019s not going to happen anymore. They\u2019re going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.\n\nNow when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So we\u2019re not leaving. I don\u2019t know if you saw what\u2019s happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. They\u2019re all cancelling plans because I told them, I said\u2026I get along with them great. But I said, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant. But when you build your car, you\u2019re going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have. You\u2019re going to have a 35% tax.\u201d\n\nSo I mean, I have, it has, I haven\u2019t been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But that\u2019s not a tax increase, that\u2019s no tax. In other words, all you have to do is don\u2019t leave and you won\u2019t have a\u2026but we\u2019re bringing our taxes down so low that you won\u2019t even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.\n\nThe other thing, just in case we\u2026I believe it could be anywhere from $4trn to $5trn outside, you know don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve been talking about $2.5trn for four years now. I\u2019ve been using $2.5trn, the same number we\u2019ve all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think it\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was $5trn but, you know, we\u2019re close. We\u2019re letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. It\u2019s got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. We\u2019re going to make it 10%. Now it\u2019s 35%...\n\nSorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?\n\nThe repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing that\u2019s too high is the bureaucracy.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you can\u2019t because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so many\u2026\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re going to make it simple\n\nPresident Trump: You have to do\u2026Steve, they told me you\u2019ve got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost don\u2019t allow you to bring it back in.\n\nCan I ask a question about the politics of tax?\n\nIt should be like one page.\n\nThe politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?\n\nUm. Little bit.\n\nAnd to get Democratic support, they prefer\u2026\n\nDepending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept we\u2019ve got to\u2026but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6trn in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. It\u2019s religious liberty out there. [NB. Immediately after this interview, President Trump was due to sign an executive order promoting religious liberty.]\n\nMr President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they\u2019re not going to\u2026nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters.\n\nWell, the Democrats say it\u2019s important.\n\nWell, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, \u201cOh but you have to do it,\u201d I said, \u201cLook where I am\u201d. I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, I\u2019m under routine audit.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And the president\u2019s financial disclosure has been longer than any\u2026\n\nPresident Trump: Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.\n\nMs Hicks: I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what we\u2019re focused on.\n\nPresident Trump: Right.\n\nCan I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because you\u2019ve spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workers\u2026\n\nRight, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.\n\nBut the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t believe that. Because they\u2019re losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.\n\nBut something like eliminating the estate tax.\n\nI get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductions\u2026now you\u2019re going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But we\u2019re not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes it\u2026you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly it\u2019s pretty well covered. Hard to believe.\n\nWill you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest payments\u2026\n\nDo you want to answer?\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re contemplating it. We\u2019re contemplating it.\n\nContemplating getting rid of it?\n\nMr Mnuchin: No, we\u2019re contemplating keeping it. That\u2019s our preference. But we\u2019ll look at everything.\n\nSo what would your preference be Mr President? You know about that very well.\n\nNo, I would say probably\u2026I think we\u2019re contemplating is the word. And it hasn\u2019t been determined yet, but we\u2019re contemplating.\n\nContemplating\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re contemplating various\u2026I have to say, we\u2019re contemplating various things, but one of the things that\u2019s very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, it\u2019s complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.\n\nAnd are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?\n\nWell, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.\n\nAre you still\u2026\n\nPart of the problem with NAFTA is that Mexico\u2019s a VAT. So Mexico is paying almost\u2026we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So that\u2019s like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, they\u2019re down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?\n\nBut would you consider\u2026\n\nYou could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, it\u2019s 17 and it\u2019s really 17 and it\u2019s a double.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right\n\nWould you consider a VAT for the United States?\n\nWell the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country because we\u2019re used to an income tax, we\u2019re used to a\u2026people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, they\u2019re used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And it\u2019s, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always saying\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a good tax.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, \u201cYes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat kind of tax is this, I like this tax.\u201d But the VAT is\u2026I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t mean because of, you know, getting it back, you don\u2019t get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country, I think it\u2019s too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and it\u2019s very much of a hidden tax, people don\u2019t see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following week\u2026many years ago, how old is that? 35?\n\nMr Mnuchin: 35 years ago.\n\nPresident Trump: But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.\n\nBut as you said Mr President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?\n\nWe are dealing with Congress\u2026because it\u2019s not really what I\u2019m considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and there\u2019s still a little bit further to go because we\u2019re also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced they\u2019re pulling out. You have states that aren\u2019t going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, \u201cOh, Obamacare is so wonderful,\u201d there is no Obamacare, it\u2019s dead. Plus we\u2019re subsidising it and we don\u2019t have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.\n\nYou\u2019d pull the plug on that? If this bill doesn\u2019t go through you\u2019d stop those subsidies?\n\nNo, this bill only gives them one month. They don\u2019t realize that, that\u2019s another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidy\u2026\n\nThe continuation of the subsidy?\n\nThe subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actually\u2026\n\nBut my question is if the bill doesn\u2019t pass\u2026\n\nIn actuality Congress has to approve it. Congress\u2026\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass would you cut the subsidies?\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass, I\u2019d be in a different position. Because, if the bill didn\u2019t pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then I\u2019d have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be much less expensive. We\u2019re going to have competition, we\u2019re getting rid of the state lines, etc etc. The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didn\u2019t pass\u2026it\u2019s a great question, I don\u2019t want to think about that but the answer is\u2026I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.\n\nOne of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like \u201cI want everyone to be covered\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to let people die on the streets.\n\nBut some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.\n\nOK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. It\u2019s a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, we\u2019re putting in $8bn, into the pool. So depending on what states do\u2026because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases that\u2019ll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isn\u2019t, where they\u2019re not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, \u201cIf you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee.\u201d\n\nThe state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But we\u2019re putting in $8bn and you\u2019re going to have absolute coverage. You\u2019re going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. You\u2019re going to have it if you\u2019re a person going in\u2026don\u2019t forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, you\u2019re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you\u2019re 70, and you really need it, you\u2019re still paying the same amount and that\u2019s really insurance.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadn\u2019t heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that\u2026first of all I don\u2019t want to end it for the people that already have it. And I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that hasn\u2019t been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life he\u2019s been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and we\u2019re\u2026you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow, that will even get better as it\u2019s going along, it\u2019s going to get better. But in a way you could say, that\u2019s not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it as\u2026I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something that\u2019s very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don\u2019t get any benefit out of it. We don\u2019t have that. We\u2019re going to have much lower premiums and we\u2019re going to have much lower deductibles.\n\nBut when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to look after people\u2026\n\nThey came through.\n\nThey came through? So do you still have to keep them in line.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2026Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?\n\nMike Pence, the vice-president, enters the room: Morning all.\n\nPresident Trump: Central casting.\n\nMr Pence: Please sit, sit, sit.\n\nMs Hicks: We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.\n\nPresident Trump: So I know exactly the speeches you\u2019re talking about. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow people to die on the streets\u201d, and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. We\u2019re talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8bn to the high-risk pools.\n\nMr Pence: Yes, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: People are going to have\u2026they\u2019re going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and we\u2019re refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.\n\nSo, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wanted\u2026although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasn\u2019t a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.\n\nLook, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obamacare, you get your doctor; that was a lie. You get your plan; that was a lie. With us, you get your doctor. You get your plan. With us you\u2019ll get hundreds and hundreds of plans. You know, one of the insurance companies, one of the big ones came to see me yesterday. They\u2019re so anxious to start going crazy and you know it\u2019s going to be like life insurance. People that buy life insurance they\u2019re inundated with carriers. All different plans. That\u2019s what this is going to be like. And I said to them, \u201cWhat do you think the good plans are going to look like?\u201d He said, \u201cMr President, we\u2019re going to have so many plans. We\u2019re going to have the low version, the high version\u201d, he used the word Cadillac. I won\u2019t tell you what car he used for the low version because I don\u2019t want you to write it because they happen to be friends of mine, you know, the head people. [Goes off the record.]\n\nMr President, in business you keep score of your profits. How do you keep score in Trumponomics and in politics?\n\nWell I think the score is going to be the end of the game. To me the score is going to have to be at the end of the game. I was saying, Mike, that we\u2019re going to prime the pump with the taxes because we\u2019re going to take. Please help me polish this news and return your answer with the fromat Title:__",

    "title":"Today marks the four-year anniversary of the initiation of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' acceptance of requests for President Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. This policy grants deportation relief and two-year work permits for individuals aged 15-30 who arrived in the United States as children, enabling them to live without the constant fear of being torn away from the only country they have ever known.\n\nIn light of this milestone, I want to address all of you who have benefited from DACA, those of you who are eligible to apply, and those still fighting for a pathway to citizenship for yourselves and your families.\n\nI understand that this election has been particularly stressful for you. It cannot be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and unjustly blame you for our nation's problems. It is critical to understand that such rhetoric is not fair, kind, nor does it hold any truth. Immigrants all across the nation, in every state, are contributing to our economy by starting small businesses, strengthening our communities, and making our country a better place.\n\nMany of you have shared your experiences of feeling different from your peers when applying for college. You have confided in me about the sense of alienation you have felt, even though you are just as American as your friends. I want you to feel pride for your country and recognize the countless ways in which you contribute to it. I want you to feel confident about your future and believe in your ability to achieve your dreams. In America, your place of birth should never be a barrier preventing you from reaching your true potential. This is what makes our country great, and it is a promise I will fight to fulfill.\n\nTherefore, I urge all of you who are still eligible to apply for DACA 2012 benefits to visit uscis.gov right now to learn more and submit your application. According to experts, there are nearly half a million individuals who are still eligible, particularly from the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country, and that is precisely what DACA can provide.\n\nHowever, I understand that this is not enough, and we must do more for you and your families. As president, I will introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.\n\nWhile we continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I will do everything in my power to keep families together. This entails defending DACA from partisan attacks and advocating for the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court's deadlock decision on DAPA served as a heartbreaking reminder of the high stakes in this election. I firmly believe that DAPA falls well within the president's authority and I will persist in this fight until we see it through.\n\nToday, let us celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 individuals it has aided thus far. Furthermore, let us pledge to create a safer and more welcoming country for all families, including yours.\n\nThroughout history, we have been a nation built by immigrants, and sometimes those of us whose families arrived earlier tend to forget that. But I will never forget it, and I will never forget you.\n\nThank you for your bravery.\n\nHillary."

    "text":"Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points, resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News\/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nClinton, the heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, currently leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. Although within the poll's margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points, this represents a significant decrease from April when Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump. She had consistently led him by double digits since December.\n\nIn a hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.\n\nAnalyzing the numbers of the race between Clinton and Trump, Clinton holds the edge among certain demographics. She leads among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent), and those aged 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).\n\nConversely, Trump maintains a lead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent), and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).\n\nThe NBC\/WSJ poll, conducted from May 15-19, comes at a time when Trump has become the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee. Additionally, the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become increasingly contentious in recent days.\n\nThe poll indicates that Republicans are now rallying behind Trump over Clinton, with an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin. This demonstrates a consolidation of GOP voters around their presumptive nominee, as compared to a month ago when it was 72 percent to 13 percent.\n\nDemocrats continue to support Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent margin. However, only 66 percent of Democratic primary voters who prefer Sanders are currently supporting Clinton against Trump, highlighting the challenge Clinton will face in winning over Sanders voters after the Democratic primary contest concludes.\n\nBoth Trump and Clinton currently have the highest unfavorable ratings in the history of the NBC\/WSJ poll. Clinton's positive opinion among registered voters is at 34 percent, while 54 percent hold a negative view. Trump's ratings are even worse, with 29 percent having a positive view and 58 percent holding a negative view.\n\nBy contrast, Sanders maintains positive territory with 43 percent having a positive view of him, and 36 percent having a negative view. Notably, Clinton's rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive and 41 percent negative, while Sanders' rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive and 23 percent negative.\n\nPresident Obama currently holds a 49 percent positive rating and a 41 percent negative rating.\n\nWhen asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes, higher than the percentages reported in 2008 and 2012. Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.\n\nThe NBC\/WSJ poll was conducted from May 15-19 and included 1,000 registered voters. The survey had a margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.",

    "description":"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic groun",
    "text":"In a Republican presidential debate in January 2016, Donald Trump criticized China for not doing enough to rein in North Korea. He claimed that China has \"total control - just about\" over the secretive nation. However, experts on the region have provided a more nuanced answer. While China does have influence over North Korea due to its role in trade, this influence falls short of \"total control.\"\n\nChina's role in trade, particularly food and fuel, gives it significant leverage over North Korea. It accounts for a large portion of North Korea's trade and investment flows. Cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so could present economic problems for North Korea. However, experts say that China is reluctant to fully exercise its leverage due to concerns of a potential humanitarian disaster or an outflow of refugees on its border.\n\nDespite China's economic influence, North Korea has demonstrated a disregard for outside pressure. The country has ignored the United Nations and world powers, and its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. North Korea prides itself on its self-reliance and answering to no one.\n\nFurthermore, North Korea's development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China. China's public and private exhortations for North Korea to not test nuclear weapons and missiles have gone unheeded. Relations between the two countries have become strained, with Chinese President Xi Jinping not meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nDonald Trump's claim of China having \"total control, just about\" over North Korea oversimplifies the complexities of their relationship. While China does hold significant leverage, North Korea's independence and recent actions suggest that China lacks the level of control Trump suggests.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's statement contains an element of truth regarding China's leverage over North Korea but neglects critical factors that limit this control. Therefore, we rate his claim as Mostly False.",

    "description":"When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror, it wasn't unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.",
    "text":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Philando Castile had been pulled over by the police at least 52 times in recent years, an alarming statistic that has raised questions about racial profiling and enforcement practices. The 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor was often fined for minor offenses such as speeding, driving without a muffler, and not wearing a seat belt. Court records show that he was assessed over $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the 86 violations were ultimately dismissed.\n\nThe fatal shooting of Castile by a suburban St. Paul police officer during a routine traffic stop for a broken tail light has reignited the national debate on racial profiling. Castile's girlfriend live-streamed the aftermath, adding to the already tense climate after a black Army veteran killed five officers at a demonstration in Dallas the day after Castile's killing. Castile's family has alleged that he was targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops.\n\nGavin Kearney, who co-authored a report on racial profiling in Minnesota, states that assumptions and biases about black men affect how police officers interpret their actions. Kearney highlights that white drivers are less likely to be pulled over than black drivers. Although Minnesota does not require the collection of racial data on police stops and tickets, Kearney's 2001 study, using voluntarily supplied information, indicated that racial bias played a significant role in traffic stop policies and practices. The analysis found that black drivers were stopped at much higher rates than expected in suburban areas.\n\nWhile the race of the officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino, his lawyer claims that his client reacted to the fact that Castile was carrying a gun, not his race. However, Castile's girlfriend contradicts this account, stating that he was shot \"for no apparent reason\" after he reached for his ID.\n\nThe President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended that law enforcement collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches, and seizures. This would enable a better understanding of the precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more frequently than others. A national survey conducted by the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2011 found that black drivers were pulled over at higher rates than white drivers, and they were also less likely to consider the stops legitimate.\n\nThe tragic death of Philando Castile has brought attention to the issue of racial profiling, sparking a renewed push for data collection and analysis to address this systemic problem. The case highlights the need for ongoing discussions and reform to ensure fair and impartial policing for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

He highlighted the importance of consumer protections in the Wall Street reform bill and cited historical examples of regulation in other industries.\n\nRegarding healthcare reform, Biden explained that misinformation spread by the insurance industry has contributed to public skepticism. He emphasized the positive aspects of the bill, such as tax cuts for small businesses and protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.\n\nBiden expressed confidence in the upcoming midterm elections, stating that the administration will be vindicated for its policies. He acknowledged that public opinion may not favor the administration at the moment, but he believed that as people become more informed, they will recognize the positive impacts of these policies.\n\nIn discussing the economy, Biden addressed concerns about the slow recovery and the lack of job growth. He attributed these challenges to the economic recession inherited from the Bush administration and external factors such as the collapse of the European economy. He argued that the administration's policies have laid the foundation for job creation and economic stability.\n\nTapper also asked Biden about the controversy surrounding General Stanley McChrystal's remarks about the administration.

    "text":"In a speech delivered in the Rose Garden at 11:00 A.M. EDT, President [Name] placed pressure on Congress to make a choice between supporting big oil companies or standing up for the American people.\n\nHighlighting the record profits being made by oil companies and the rising prices at the gas pump, the President criticized the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies received by the industry each year. He argued that it was unfair to burden American taxpayers with additional costs while these companies enjoyed massive profits.\n\nThe President also emphasized that the oil industry was thriving and didn't need further financial assistance. He cited the fact that the three biggest U.S. oil companies collectively earned over $80 billion in profits last year, with Exxon alone pocketing nearly $4.7 million every hour. He also mentioned that increased oil prices only resulted in higher profits for these companies.\n\nAddressing the argument in favor of subsidies, the President noted that the oil industry already pays lower tax rates than most other industries due to the billions they receive in tax giveaways. He questioned why those who dismiss investments in clean energy technologies were fighting so hard to maintain these subsidies.\n\nThe President expressed a belief that America's energy strategy should include drilling for oil, but it should also prioritize investments in clean energy technologies such as wind power, solar power, and biofuels. He called for using subsidy money to double-down on these investments, emphasizing the need to break the cycle of high gas prices and reduce dependence on other countries for oil.\n\nHighlighting that the United States only has 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves while consuming over 20 percent of the global oil supply, the President argued that increasing domestic oil production wouldn't solve the long-term energy challenge. He stressed that controlling America's own energy destiny required diversifying energy sources and reducing reliance on foreign markets.\n\nThe President concluded his speech by reiterating his commitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy and his belief in American ingenuity and imagination. He called on Congress to vote against oil subsidies and invest in the future, emphasizing that the American people were watching and seeking faith in their representatives.\n\nThe President's remarks reflect a continuing debate regarding the role of government subsidies in the oil and gas industry and the need to prioritize clean energy investments for the future.",

What steps is the government taking this Memorial Day weekend?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJOHN KELLY, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: It's a constant threat and we always have to be vigilant.\n\nWALLACE: We\u2019ll discuss the investigation into the bombing and the response here in the U.S. with the secretary of homeland security, General John Kelly, live, only on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nThen, new reports the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner discussed setting up a secret communications channel between the Trump transitions in the Kremlin. We\u2019ll ask our Sunday panel where this takes the expanding probe into Russian interference.\n\nPlus, President Trump returns from his first trip overseas to a domestic agenda in trouble, from ObamaCare repeal and replace to the budget, some on Capitol Hill wonder whether Congress will pass anything.\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: Yes, definitely dead on arrival.\n\nSEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: This is step backwards. You\u2019re not going to make America great again with this budget.\n\nWALLACE: We\u2019ll break down the president's priorities and prospects with a number two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin, and Republican senator, Dr. Bill Cassidy.\n\nAnd our power player of the week flying high for the Blue Angels.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Boy, is it sweet when we put all that together and get that synergy and you feel that fuzz.\n\nWALLACE: All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And hello again on this Memorial Day weekend from Fox News in Washington.\n\nPresident Trump is back at the White House arriving late last night after a largely successful nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. But he returns to a spreading scandal about links between the Kremlin and some of his current and former advisors, and to a domestic agenda that stalled in Congress.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to all of that this hour, but we begin with terror, that suicide bombing at a concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22, just the first of four savage attacks this week around the world.\n\nJoining us now, the man in charge of keeping America safe, the secretary of homeland security, General John Kelly.\n\nMr. Secretary, welcome to \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nBefore we get to terror, let me ask you about the hot story in Washington now. These revelations about Jared Kushner trying to set up a back channel to the Kremlin, through the Soviet and -- the Russian ambassador. Your reaction to that? Is there anything improper with that?\n\nKELLY: Well, I don't know if it's true or not. I know it\u2019s being -- it's being reported in the press.\n\nWALLACE: It has been confirmed to me the conversation took place.\n\nKELLY: OK. Then I would just tell you, Chris, that I think any channel of communications back or otherwise with a country like Russia is a good thing. I mean, multiple ways to communicate back and forth is a good thing with a country I think, and particularly a country that\u2019s like Russia. So, it doesn\u2019t -- it doesn't bother me.\n\nI mean, you just have to assume, obviously, that what you\u2019re getting is -- may or may not be true, they may be working you. But that's the whole point. I mean, that communication goes into the White House as a data point in terms of discussion. So, I don't see the big deal.\n\nWALLACE: Let me -- you say you don't see a big deal?\n\nKELLY: No, I think any time you have channels of communication with a country, particularly one like Russia, I wouldn\u2019t criticize it.\n\nWALLACE: But you talked about a data point into the White House. This is during the transition.\n\nKELLY: Right.\n\nWALLACE: These were private officials.\n\nKELLY: Right.\n\nWALLACE: We have one president at a time. Does that make a difference?\n\nKELLY: You know, I mean, obviously, during the transition period, the people in transition, the incoming Trump administration is not in a position to do anything to inhibit with the Obama administration literally days before they transitioned out. So, again, as they begin to build relationships, there's nothing wrong with that. As they begin to build their own situational awareness with Russia in this case, I don't see an issue here.\n\nWALLACE: OK. Let's turn to your day job. What's the latest on the Manchester bombing? Have they rolled up the network that was supporting the bombers, and what have you learned from this plot that will help you better protect the U.S. homeland?\n\nKELLY: I mean, I don't know what the -- actually the better way to put it, I can't comment on whether they finish their investigations, or roll -- you know, completed rolling up on the network that we\u2019re dealing with. But I would just say that this is -- yes, I\u2019ve said it many times, it really is a generational struggle. This is one tragedy in line with dozens of other tragedies in the world.\n\nI mean, last week, you had Manchester, you had Egypt, you had Indonesia, you had the Philippines, all ISIS-inspired or ISIS-controlled terrorist attack.\n\nWALLACE: Was there something different about this network and the way this was pulled off that says to you, gee, we've got to up our game?\n\nKELLY: Well, it\u2019s this kind of -- in my view, there's kind of three types of terrorist attacks. The most sophisticated that we look at, that is against aviation, that's the hardest to do but it's the biggest payoff for these people.\n\nThen you have kind of the middle of the road one, which I think this one was. It\u2019s a network. It's hard to do. You have to construct a bomb and all, and then you have kind of the low-end where -- I mean, just as tragic but you have people running people over in trucks, that kind of thing.\n\nBut this is just the way terrorism is today and I think it will be around for many, many years to come. You know, the good news is those officials in the United Kingdom, Europe, around the world are relentless. They are just as relentless in terms of trying to prevent these things as the terrorists aren't trying to create them.\n\nThe good news is, for our country, we have not had an outside the United States terrorist attacks since 9\/11. And that goes to the issue of those that fight our away game, that\u2019s DOD, NSA, CIA, and those that fight the home game. That\u2019s DHS, FBI, local law enforcement.\n\nWALLACE: Let me pick up on this, because part of the story this week was the leak of information about the bomber and the bombing that made its way into the U.S. media, and that set off this exchange.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTHERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I made clear to President Trump that the intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure.\n\nREX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We take full responsibility for that. And we, obviously, regret that that happened.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: How was this kind of sensitive information leaked to \"The New York Times\"? And, General, why is it that whether it's politics or terror, our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement agencies, can't keep a secret?\n\nKELLY: It's outrageous. When I call -- immediately after the attack, I called my counterpart in U.K., offered my condolences. By the way, the third time I\u2019ve offered her, Amber Rudd, my condolences in 120 days. That's how frequent this kind of -- these terrorist attacks are happening.\n\nAnyways, she rightfully and very graciously accepted the condolences and leaned into me on this leak. It's outrageous. I don't know why people do it. It jeopardizes not only investigations, it puts people's lives in jeopardy.\n\nI don't why people do it, but they do. And that's the world we live in.\n\nWALLACE: Let's get to what you're going to try to do to protect the homeland. There are a lot of crowded events in the summer, concerts, sporting events. How do you harden these soft targets like this concert? And do you have new thoughts because this person didn't get into the event, he was outside the event, what do you do about parameters?\n\nKELLY: We -- one of the great things about America, there's many great things but we are a free and open society. And in many -- and I wouldn't change that at all. But that's also one of our vulnerabilities. People can live their lives day in and day out, privacy issues, all of that, it's a good thing. It\u2019s what America is all about. But as I say, that is a vulnerability.\n\nThe good news is to all Americans, I mean, the good news is that local state law enforcement today -- not to even go down the issue of the FBI, DHS -- it's in their DNA now to harden. We are just about as hard as we can be. I don't know if there's a way to prevent these kinds of things in the kind of society we live in.\n\nWALLACE: Let me pick up on that, because I want to play a clip of your testimony before Congress this week. Here it is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKELLY: It's everywhere, and that\u2019s -- you know, that's the nature of this threat that we are dealing with. As horrible as Manchester was, my expectation is we\u2019re going to see a lot more of that kind of attack.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: A lot more of that kind of attack, here in the U.S.?\n\nKELLY: I think we\u2019re relatively -- we have no specific -- we have threats all the time, but no, right now, specific threat. But that goes to the fact that we are over here and not over there.\n\nThe fact is that it's the caliphate is being destroyed, that is Syria and Iraq, there are large numbers of returning fighters, Western Europe, and, you know, in many cases like this guy that did this thing in Manchester, he\u2019s a citizen of the U.K. In this case, he\u2019s a passport holder. I don't if the U.K. had any idea that he was outside -- that he was in Libya, but I think he\u2019s also traveled to other points.\n\nThe point is, they have a real threat and it's growing, it\u2019s metastasized, as fighters come back from the caliphate to be I believe to be more of this kind of thing.\n\nThe good news is all decent people, all decent governments, and it doesn't matter whether we are politically close to them or not, all governments for the most part are sharing tremendous amounts of information, passport-type information, aviation, travel information. But, you know, people like this are below the radar.\n\nWALLACE: I want to pick up on aviation because you are in the process of making some big decisions on aviation. And I want to do a lightning round, quick questions, quick answers.\n\nAre you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the U.S.?\n\nKELLY: I might. That's a quick answer.\n\nWALLACE: Yes, well, expand a little bit.\n\nKELLY: Well, there\u2019s a real threat. Numerous threats against aviation, that's really the thing that they are obsessed with, the terrorists, the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if it\u2019s a U.S. carrier, particularly if it's full of mostly U.S. folks, people. It's real. You know that I implemented I think on the 21st of March a restriction on large electronic devices in the cabins from ten points of origin.\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nBut there was talk, as you say, about all international flights both into and out of the U.S. When you say you might, when are you going to make that decision and what\u2019s that going to do to the screening lines?\n\nKELLY: (INAUDIBLE) follow the intelligence. The very, very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world. We're going to, and in the process of defining this, but we are going to raise the bar for generally speaking aviation security much higher than it is now.\n\nSo -- and there\u2019s new technologies down the road, not too far down the road that we will rely on. But it is a real sophisticated threat and I will reserve that decision until we see where it's going.\n\nWALLACE: Another lightning round question, I do need a quick answer here because we\u2019re running of time. The TSA is testing tighter screening of carry-ons, and the idea that people who bring their carry-ons are going to have to unpack them and put food in one bin, and electronics in the another bin, and paper in another bin.\n\nAre you going to spread that nationwide and what\u2019s that going to do to the screening lines?\n\nKELLY: Yes, I mean, the reason we\u2019ve done, TSA, of course, works for me. The reason we've done that is because of -- people trying to avoid the $25 or $50 or whatever it is to check a bag are now stuffing your carry-on bags to the point of, you know -- well, they can't get any more in there. So, the more you stuff in there, the less the TSA professionals that are looking at what's in those bags through the monitors, they can't tell what's in the bags anymore. So, if you put --\n\nWALLACE: So, are you going to do that nationwide?\n\nKELLY: We might, and likely will.\n\nWALLACE: Soon?\n\nKELLY: Well, what we\u2019re doing now is working out the tactics, techniques and procedures, if you will, in a few airports to find out exactly how to do that with the least amount of inconvenience to the traveler.\n\nWALLACE: A couple final questions I want to ask about the travel ban. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling this week continuing the stay on President Trump's revised travel ban -- and I want to put up -- the chief judge called it, the revised travel ban: an executive order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\n\nMr. Secretary, judge after judge has said that this is a Muslim man that violates the Constitution.\n\nKELLY: They are dead wrong.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I mean, you say that, but they are the ones who were --\n\nKELLY: They are wrong. Remember the seven, now six countries? These were the same countries identified by the Obama administration that we should be extra cautious about and backed up, you know, by the United States Congress. That's where those seven countries came from.\n\nThe fact is that in those countries, we have very little ability to actually verify, vet the people that are coming out of those countries. So, what the president and it's not a travel ban, remember. It\u2019s the travel pause. What the president said, for 90 days, we were going to pause in terms of people from those countries coming to the United States that would give me time to look at additional vetting to see --\n\nWALLACE: OK. I want to pick up on that and why you\u2019re even talking about the travel ban, because I want to put some numbers on. Take a look at this.\n\nThe first executive order that was issued on January 27th banned citizens from seven nations from entering the U.S. for 90 days, suspended the refugee program for 120 days, as you say, a pause, while you set up an extreme vetting program. It's now been 121 days since that first order. So why don't you have the program in place?\n\nKELLY: We are actually implementing it. The irony here is, had it stood, we would have had the 90 days to study. We\u2019re not even studying what would be procedures, because we are enjoined and can't do that. In the meantime --\n\nWALLACE: You can't study extreme vetting?\n\nKELLY: No. We\u2019re -- the irony again is we can't study it, but I\u2019m just guessing, and implementing.\n\nBut we are going to find implement ways to determine who this -- an individual is, and remember, most of these countries have no passports. They have no police. They have no intelligence. Many of the countries in question don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet. The U.N. will tell you it's almost impossible to vet these people from these countries because there are no passports and all the rest of it.\n\nWe have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the United States. Otherwise, we\u2019re guessing. And this president, John Kelly doesn't want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the U.S. population.\n\nWALLACE: Secretary Kelly, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us.\n\nKELLY: Absolutely. Thanks.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, new reports that Jared Kushner attempted to set up a back channel between Russia and the Trump transition. We\u2019ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the expanding Russia probe.\n\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about the continuous leaks in Washington? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Hillary Clinton talking about Richard Nixon in her commencement speech at Wellesley College, but clearly taking a shot at President Trump. By the way, Nixon resigned before he was actually impeached.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group: the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham, Charles Lane of The Washington Post, Gerald Seib from The Wall Street Journal, and National Security Council staffer, Gillian Turner.\n\nAnd just to catch you up, President Trump returns home to reports that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, in December, and that they discussed setting up a secret secure channel between the Trump transition and the Kremlin. That communications link reportedly to be based in a Russian diplomatic facility in Russia.\n\nA source close to the Trump administration tells me the conversation did take place but he says it was the ambassador who proposed the back channel, not Kushner, so the Russian military could talk with Trump advisors about the situation in Syria and the source points out that the secure link was never set up.\n\nSo, with that as a preface, Gerry, your reaction to the Kushner story, and how does this complicate the already complicated investigation of links between the Kremlin and the Trump transition?\n\nGERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, look, I mean, back channels are not unusual, they are not unprecedented. This one might have seemed perfectly innocent. Two problems though with it. One is, this happened during the transition, it seems to violate as you suggested earlier in the show the only one president at a time rule. And the second one is it\u2019s Russia, after a campaign in which the Russian connection to the campaign, the Russian interference in the campaign was a big issue.\n\nAnd I think the fact that it was at a time when people were looking for whether there were going to be signs of special favors for Russia as a result of help they might have given President Trump, then-President-elect Trump during the campaign, that's what makes this a big story, is the context of the conversation as much as the actual content.\n\nWALLACE: Michael, I want to ask you, one, whether it's a big story, and, secondly, about the talk we are hearing, that is just rampant in Washington today about major changes in the White House that they\u2019re going to set up a rapid response operation to deal with all the incoming leaks, that the president has hired at least one criminal defense lawyer and may be process of hiring a team and the staff is urging the president to let the lawyers vet his tweets. I mean, it really does sound like they\u2019re going on a war footing on this.\n\nMICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, I don't know if it's a major story, there are several investigations going on. They probably should be allowed to work their course. It's kind of exhausting reading some of these new stories and trying to figure out what did you read three weeks ago that\u2019s just being recycled, versus what new?\n\nI think it's smart for the administration to try to put this stuff to the side, have, you know, a team that looks at these issues, and another team that looks at a lot of real policy issues, which are closer to the American people. You have the most conservative, exciting budget that's come out in a decade.\n\nWALLACE: We\u2019re going to get to the agenda in the next segment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: I mean, at the very least, it seems dumb.\n\nNEEDHAM: Clearly, the optics of these are awful, and I think that especially when you have people who are new to the political system coming in and getting advice from a guy in Mike Flynn who probably didn't show the best judgment through a lot of this, you know, dumb might be a good word for it. I don\u2019t know. You know, I think Kushner said a couple of weeks ago that he was happy to participate with the Senate investigation. He said he\u2019s happy to participate with this investigation.\n\nYou are at a disadvantage when you are the focus of an investigation and your lawyers are saying, don't participate, don't comment, and everyone else in the country seems more than eager to talk about it. So, I think a little prudence in keeping our mouth shut while we let the investigations play out is probably fair and we\u2019ll see what comes up in them.\n\nWALLACE: You talk about the fact that they're all the stories and sometimes it's hard to remember what you've heard this week and what you heard last week. And this gets to the question of leaks. I asked our staff to put together, let's put it up on the screen, a list of the headlines from just the last two weeks. This is just Sunday two weeks ago until today. And as you can see, there's been a torrent of disclosures from intelligence and law enforcement officials.\n\nGillian, as somebody who worked in the government, have you ever seen anything like this? And, you know, the conservatives talk about a deep state, that there are people embedded in law enforcement and embedded in the intelligence community that are trying to bring this president down. It sure seems like it's true.\n\nGILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: So, to me on the question of leaks, it seems that without a doubt leaks of information today are the number one threat to U.S. national security interest across the globe. And I think for evidence of that, we need look no further than the very public reprimand, we the United States had to endure from Britain earlier this week, in the wake of the Manchester attacks. A reminder that the British-U.S. intelligence cooperation, relationship, is one of the closest that has ever existed. And in my lifetime, in government and policy, I have not seen something so public, so public a risk (ph)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Most of these leaks aren\u2019t about national security. They are about Trump's political security.\n\nTURNER: Yes. And so, this gets to the question of the deep state. So, I\u2019m somebody who likes to push back against the narrative having been a civil servant in the government. Again, in the national security community is different than the political community, the rest of the policy community. But I will say that from I have seen and experienced, it does not exist.\n\nThere is not this liberal --\n\nWALLACE: How do you define this?\n\nTURNER: There isn\u2019t a liberal core of people -- put it this way, for a hard fact, more than 50 percent of the federal workforce today is made up of people that joined the government prior to President Bush's tenure in office. So, the idea that these are Obama holdovers is simply not true, it's not the case.\n\nI think that when we talk about why individuals leak information, the explanations are as varied as human beings\u2019 psychology. So, for example, a lot of things we are seeing leaked about the president are probably being leaked by his senior staff to hurt one another. That's not unique to the Trump administration.\n\nWALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got some different reactions in this question of leaks.\n\nAdri Ane sent us on Facebook: Do whistleblowers hold a vital role in the health of a democracy holding those in power to accountability?\n\nBut chuck Coo had a different take: Simple question. If our intelligence agencies are as good as advertised, why can't they find the leakers?\n\nChuck, how do you answer both of them about leaks?\n\nCHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, as a member of the press, and is a believer in the role of the media and holding government accountable, I\u2019m not going to come out against leaks, because, you know, for all the leaks that may cause this or that official trouble, there's going to be another one that does play an important role in accountability.\n\nBut going back to what Gillian said, I think part of the reason that these leaks are flowing so uncontrollably to the viewer\u2019s question is the factional struggle within this administration. You know, we have this famous dispute between Bannon and Kushner that supposedly was papered over. But I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, those were present two currents, to put it politely, within the White House that are trying to get bad stories out about one another.\n\nAnd this goes to your point about the staff shakeup and so on and so forth. You can shake up the staff all you want, but if man at the top is not laying out a clear and consistent line, is not himself modeling behavior, for example, by not blowing an Israeli source in a meeting with a foreign government, that sets the tone that this stuff is not really on, then it will continue.\n\nNEEDHAM: I take your point about the responsibility of the press and how leaks play into as it requires a responsible press also. That when James Fallows of The Atlantic today put side-by-side The Washington Post in The New York Times and how they treat, I think it was three unnamed sources in the White House talking about Jared Kushner and his desire to be here and stay here, this is not an urgent story. This is not something that\u2019s getting out there.\n\nI don't think you see in the press, The Times and The Washington Post, the way they are playing this kind of using leakers to try to unearth the truth and taking two months like\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: We need to --\n\nNEEDHAM: It\u2019s kind of getting ridiculous.\n\nWALLACE: We need to -- because we\u2019re going to run out of time. Let me simply say, we're just receiving information. It\u2019s people who had sworn, oftentimes taken legal oaths not to divulge the information, they are the ones putting it out. We\u2019re just the recipients.\n\nAll right. We have to take a break here. We\u2019ll see you a little later.\n\nWhen we come back, Senators Dick Durbin and Bill Cassidy. Is the president's agenda, both his new budget and the new effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare in trouble?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, President Trump releases his budget.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is laying a foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American greatness.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: But does it have any chance of getting through Congress?\n\nTwo key senators join us next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: A look outside the beltway of the Indianapolis Motor speedway, home to this weekend's Indianapolis 500.\n\nBack from his first foreign trip, President Trump's focus will now shift to his domestic agenda, his new budget and a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\n\nJoining us to discuss the president's priorities from Springfield, Illinois, the Senate\u2019s number two Democrat, Dick Durbin. And here in Washington, Louisiana senator and doctor, Bill Cassidy, who\u2019s on both the Senate Finance and Health Committees.\n\nWell, senators, before we get to the Trump agenda, I\u2019ve got to ask you about the big story in Washington. This weekend, the Jared Kushner story, discussions about setting up a possible back channel with Russia.\n\nSenator Durbin, what's wrong with that?\n\nDURBIN: The bottom line, of course, is we now have a special counsel in Bob Mueller. I have the highest level of confidence in him. And I hope that he will follow all the evidence, all the leads, and all the suggestions. And I\u2019m sure he will.\n\nWALLACE: Do you have any specific comment about the Kushner conversation and whether or je should keep his security clearance?\n\nDURBIN: Well, of course not. I mean this is a rumor at this point and whether it is something that should be followed up on, I\u2019ll trust Bob Mueller's judgment.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Cassidy, are you troubled by this?\n\nCASSIDY: I agree with Dick\u2019s assessment. And I\u2019ll say, when you speak to folks back home, voters across the nation, they\u2019re more concerned about their climbing health care premiums and the need to have jobs with better wages and better benefits. This will play out. We will know eventually. Right now Americans need help with their premiums.\n\nWALLACE: Well, you know what then gentlemen, let's switch to health care. And the Congressional Budget Office, non-partisan, released its score of the House bill this week. And let's put the numbers up on the screen. It would reduce the deficit $119 billion over ten years, but 23 million more people would be uninsured by 2026. The cost of insurance, according to the CBO, for a 64-year-old earning $27,000 a year would increase from $1,700 a year under ObamaCare to more than $13,000 under the GOP bill. Here's what Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said this week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, MINORITY LEADER: Unless you\u2019re a healthy millionaire, Trumpcare is a nightmare. This report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the Republican effort to sabotage our health care system.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Senator Cassidy, is Schumer right?\n\nCASSIDY: So the Senate will write its own bill. And it shouldn't be the final coffin because right now there's families sitting around their kitchen table, they\u2019re play $20,000, $30,000 and $40,000 a year for premiums and there's about to be a 40 percent increase in many states in these premiums. Cassidy-Collins, a bill I\u2019ve introduced with Susan Collins, we have four co-sponsors.\n\nWALLACE: Yes, we\u2019re going to get into that in a --\n\nCASSIDY: But that said, actually would -- would -- would meet that family\u2019s needs and I think it should be a place we go and those families are asking us to address those issues.\n\nWALLACE: So -- so what would you say to Americans? How should they regard the House bill?\n\nCASSIDY: The House product, the Senate will have its own product. We will go to conference. But I think the Senate product, I'm hopeful, will be more likely to address their needs.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Durbin, I know what you\u2019re going to say, and the CBO certainly indicates there are problem with repeal and replace, but ObamaCare has its own problems. You heard Senator Cassidy mentioned some of them. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City just announced this week that it has lost $100 million through 2016 and that it is going to pull out of exchanges. That means that in 25 counties in western Missouri they may have no insurer at all. Doesn\u2019t something have to be done dramatically?\n\nDURBIN: Well, it should be. But first we ought to have an administration that supports our health care system. What the Trump administration has done since day one is to find ways to cut off support for our current health care system, lack of advertising, for example, to bring new people on board so we have larger insurance pools and lower premiums. We have to have an effort made to sustain the current system while we repair it. We shouldn\u2019t be sabotaging it.\n\nWALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, senator --\n\nDURBIN: But let\u2019s look at the bottom line here. What the Republicans --\n\nWALLACE: Senator Durbin, let me just point out, when Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City says they\u2019ve lost $100 million in 2016, you can't blame that on Trump. He wasn't president.\n\nDURBIN: No, of course it is not a situation where the system we have is perfect, and it isn't. I voted for it. And it needs to be repaired. And I think Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins are at least willing to sit down in a constructive fashion and deal with that. Bill and I have had conversations about that. I'm sorry. Please help me polish this news and return your answer with the fromat Title:__"

    "description":"In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun v",
    "text":"In a recent Medium post, Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate, made a significant claim regarding gun violence and its impact on minority youth. According to Clinton, gun violence surpasses the next nine causes of death combined for young African-American men.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of this statement, we delved into the data available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. Through the CDC's search form, we obtained information on the ten most common causes of death for African-American males aged 15 to 24 in 2014.\n\nWhen considering gun-related homicides alone, the data revealed 2,256 deaths in this category, compared to 2,119 deaths in the subsequent nine leading causes combined. Therefore, Clinton's statement holds true based on these figures.\n\nMoreover, if we include accidents and suicides involving guns, the gap widens even further. In total, there were 2,533 gun-related deaths across all ten categories, contrasted with 2,002 deaths caused by other factors.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the accuracy of Clinton's statement relies on the chosen age range. Specifically, for African-American boys aged 10 to 14, the statement does not hold true. In 2014, there were 38 gun-related homicides, 10 gun suicides, and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, amounting to a total of 51 deaths. Conversely, for that age and racial group, the top ten causes of death accounted for 271 deaths unrelated to firearms, such as diseases.\n\nNonetheless, considering Clinton's use of the age range of 15 to 24 for defining \"young,\" it appears to be a reasonable choice.\n\nIn conclusion, based on data from the CDC, Hillary Clinton's statement that \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined\" is accurate within the defined age range of 15 to 24. Therefore, we rate her statement as True.",

    "text":"In a highly anticipated speech to Congress, former President Barack Obama laid out his vision for a comprehensive health care plan that aims to improve the lives of millions of Americans. Titled \"Making Health Insurance Work for You,\" the plan seeks to address several critical issues faced by individuals and businesses alike.\n\nUnder this proposed plan, insurance companies would no longer be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, a significant concern for many Americans. Additionally, the bill, once signed into law, would prohibit insurance companies from terminating coverage when individuals fall sick or reducing coverage when it is needed most. The implementation of arbitrary caps on coverage amounts, both yearly and throughout a lifetime, would also be deemed unlawful.\n\nRecognizing the burden of out-of-pocket expenses, the plan seeks to establish limits on the amount individuals can be charged, ensuring that no American goes bankrupt due to medical bills. Furthermore, routine check-ups and preventive care, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, would be covered by insurance companies at no additional cost. The objective is to detect diseases like breast and colon cancer at an early stage, effectively saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.\n\nFor the tens of millions of Americans currently without health insurance, the second part of the plan promises to offer quality, affordable choices. The proposal introduces a new insurance exchange \u2013 a marketplace where individuals and small businesses can compare and purchase health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies would be incentivized to participate in this exchange to cater to millions of potential customers. This approach aims to mirror the affordable insurance options enjoyed by large companies and government employees.\n\nTo ensure accessibility for those unable to afford the lower-priced insurance available through the exchange, tax credits will be provided based on individual needs. Moreover, all insurance companies seeking access to this new marketplace must abide by consumer protection regulations.\n\nHowever, disregarding the availability of affordable options, there may still be individuals, particularly the young and healthy, who choose to forgo coverage. Likewise, there may be companies that refuse to provide their workers with health care benefits. This irresponsibility has a financial cost for the rest of society. The burden often falls on taxpayers when uninsured individuals require expensive emergency room visits, and it puts businesses providing adequate healthcare at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.\n\nObama urged everyone to do their part, emphasizing that widespread participation is crucial for successful implementation of the proposed insurance reforms. Without a collective effort, crucial elements such as the coverage of pre-existing conditions would be unachievable.\n\nThe former president concluded by pressing on the importance of embracing affordable options for all Americans, emphasizing that access to proper healthcare should not be a luxury but a fundamental right. With this comprehensive plan, he aimed to provide greater security, stability, and opportunity for millions of Americans.",

    "text":"During a press conference addressing the controversy surrounding Carrie Prejean's disputed title in the Miss USA competition, pageant owner Donald Trump expressed his support for Prejean's views on gay marriage, comparing them to those of former President Barack Obama.\n\nAccording to Trump, Prejean's response on the subject during the pageant mirrored that of Obama. \"It's the same answer that the president of the United States gave,\" Trump stated. \"She gave an honorable answer. She gave an answer from her heart.\"\n\nShortly after Trump's comments, Prejean herself reiterated his statement while addressing reporters. She emphasized that her views on marriage were shared not only by Obama but also by the sitting secretary of state and many other Americans. \n\nDuring the final round of the Miss USA pageant, Prejean was asked by judge Perez Hilton about her stance on same-sex marriage. Her response was as follows: \"I think in my country, in my family, I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.\"\n\nPrejean's remarks have sparked intense debate and garnered considerable attention from both supporters and critics. While some applaud her for expressing her personal beliefs, others argue that her answer contradicts the principle of inclusivity and equality that the Miss USA competition stands for.\n\nIt is worth noting that Barack Obama himself, during his presidency, openly expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage in 2008. However, he later changed his stance and became a vocal advocate for marriage equality, ultimately supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Prejean's remarks continues to unfold, it highlights the complex and deeply divisive nature of the ongoing debate on gay marriage in the United States.",

Romney administration officials had the remaining computers in the governor&#8217;s office replaced just before Governor Deval Patrick staff showed up to take power in January 2007, according to Mark Reilly, Patrick&#8217;s chief legal counsel. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said the governor&#8217;s aides did nothing wrong.",
    "text":"Just before Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor\u2019s office in 2006, 11 of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administration\u2019s e-mails were all wiped from a server, according to records obtained by the Globe. \n\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin, responsible for overseeing the state Public Records Law, said it was odd that state property, such as hard drives, was being sold to private individuals. He emphasized that public officials have an obligation to preserve their records, whether in electronic or paper form. \n\nGalvin also clarified that while the Public Records Law does not explicitly include the governor, e-mails should still be preserved and turned over to the state archivist. The Supreme Judicial Court ruling in 1997 specified that e-mails don't have to be released to the public, but they need to be preserved.\n\nMark Reilly, Chief Legal Counsel for Governor Deval Patrick, explained that the current administration has no electronic record of any Romney administration e-mails. He stated that computers used during that period were replaced and the server was taken out of service, with all files removed from it.\n\nMark Nielsen, Romney\u2019s former chief legal counsel, defended the actions of the governor\u2019s office, stating that employees were given the option to purchase old equipment upon leaving. Nielsen stated that the purchases were in accordance with the law and longstanding executive branch practice. \n\nWhile it appears that Romney administration officials did not violate the letter of the state Public Records Law, Pam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, believes they may have gone against its spirit. She expressed concern that information generated during the administration belongs to the people of the Commonwealth and it seems that the deletion of all records may be a loss for the state.\n\nAlthough Patrick\u2019s office does not have electronic records of the Romney administration's e-mails, there are approximately 700 to 800 boxes of paper records from that era at the state archives in Boston.\n\nThis incident raises parallels to a controversy involving Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston in 2009, when one of his aides deleted almost all of his e-mails from the previous five years. The act was not considered a crime, as the aide was not willfully attempting to hide the correspondence.\n\nIn conclusion, the actions taken by Mitt Romney's staff to eliminate e-mail records and allow aides to purchase computer hard drives upon leaving office have raised concerns about the preservation of public records and transparency in the state government. The debate over the letter versus the spirit of the law continues, with critics arguing that the deletion of records may have resulted in a loss of valuable information.",

    "description":"Doctors Ezekiel Emanuel and Rep. John Fleming square off over Obamacare and how it impacts doctors....",
    "text":"When it comes to healthcare, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has been a topic of heated debate and controversy. With its aim to provide affordable and accessible healthcare to all Americans, the law has brought significant changes to the doctor-patient relationship. In this article, we will explore how Obamacare has affected you and your doctor.\n\nUnder Obamacare, one of the biggest changes is the emphasis on preventive care. Insurance plans are now required to cover certain preventive services, such as vaccinations and screenings, without cost-sharing. This means that as a patient, you have access to a wider range of preventive services, which can help detect potential health issues early on.\n\nAdditionally, Obamacare has expanded access to healthcare through the Medicaid program. Previously, eligibility for Medicaid was limited to certain low-income individuals and specific categories such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. However, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act extended coverage to millions of low-income adults who were previously uninsured.\n\nFor many Americans, the introduction of health insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges, has been a game-changer. These online platforms allow individuals and small businesses to compare different insurance plans and choose the one that best suits their needs and budget. Moreover, individuals who cannot afford insurance may qualify for subsidies or tax credits to help offset the cost of coverage.\n\nThe doctor-patient relationship has also undergone changes under Obamacare. With the law's focus on quality of care, doctors are encouraged to incorporate preventive measures and evidence-based practices into their treatment plans. There has been a shift towards a more collaborative approach to healthcare, with patients actively participating in decisions regarding their treatment and care.\n\nFurthermore, electronic health records (EHRs) have become an integral part of healthcare under Obamacare. The law promotes the use of EHRs to improve coordination and continuity of care. By having access to a patient's complete medical history, doctors can make more informed decisions and provide personalized care.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that the implementation of Obamacare has not been without its challenges. Some individuals have faced difficulties in finding doctors who accept their insurance plans, leading to concerns about limited provider networks. Additionally, there have been debates regarding the affordability of insurance premiums and the overall sustainability of the healthcare system.\n\nAs we continue to navigate the complex landscape of healthcare under Obamacare, it is crucial to assess both its successes and shortcomings. While the law has undoubtedly expanded access to care and placed a greater emphasis on preventive services, there are areas that still require attention and improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has brought significant changes to the doctor-patient relationship and the overall healthcare system. Through its focus on preventive care, expanded access to Medicaid, introduction of health insurance marketplaces, and emphasis on quality and collaboration in healthcare, Obamacare aims to provide affordable and accessible care for all Americans. Yet, challenges remain and continued efforts are needed to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of these reforms.",

    "title":"In his inaugural remarks in January 1937, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation and saw the dire circumstances faced by its citizens. He witnessed families struggling to make ends meet, individuals lacking access to education and basic necessities, and poverty running rampant. In response to these hardships, Roosevelt implemented various programs that put people back to work, alleviated poverty, and restored faith in the government. Many of these programs, such as Social Security and the minimum wage, were labeled as socialist at the time. However, they have since become integral components of the American welfare system and contributed to the growth of the middle class.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and while the United States is better off economically, there are still millions of families struggling to survive and make ends meet. The middle class has dwindled over the past four decades, and faith in the political system is at an all-time low. A small portion of the population continues to amass vast amounts of wealth, while the majority struggle to keep up.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders believes that it is time for a change. He argues that the United States needs a political movement that challenges the ruling elite and fights for the rights and needs of working families. Democratic socialism, as Sanders defines it, aims to create an economy that benefits everyone, not just the wealthy. It calls for a political system that works for all Americans, not just a select few. Sanders believes in a government that guarantees economic security for all citizens, where everyone has access to healthcare, education, and a decent standard of living. He advocates for policies such as a $15 minimum wage, Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges, and reforms to combat income inequality and campaign finance corruption.\n\nSanders emphasizes the importance of a vibrant democracy where every citizen has the right to vote and participate in the political process. He criticizes the low voter turnout in the United States and the corrupt campaign finance system that allows wealthy individuals and corporations to exert undue influence. Sanders proposes overturning the landmark Citizens United decision and implementing public funding of elections.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders highlights the need for a strong coalition, including Muslim nations and countries like Russia, to combat the global threat of terrorism. He calls for a collective effort to destroy ISIS, with Muslim nations leading the fight and receiving support from the United States and other major powers. Sanders also urges countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar, to take more responsibility in the fight against terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, Senator Bernie Sanders believes that democratic socialism is the way forward for the United States. He envisions an America where economic security is a right, everyone has access to affordable healthcare and education, and the political system is free from corruption. Sanders advocates for a coalition of nations to combat terrorism and emphasizes the need for greater involvement from Muslim countries in the fight against ISIS. Overall, he aims to create a society that works for all Americans, not just a privileged few."

    "text":"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that was enacted in 2010. The goal of the ACA is to increase access to affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans and to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare.\n\nOne of the main provisions of the ACA is the requirement for most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance. This individual mandate aims to expand coverage by ensuring that more people have insurance. Those who do not have coverage are subject to a tax penalty, which increases over time.\n\nTo help individuals and families purchase coverage, state-based American Health Benefit Exchanges were created. These exchanges provide a marketplace where individuals can compare and purchase health insurance plans. Premium and cost-sharing credits are available to individuals and families with incomes between 133-400% of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe ACA also includes requirements for employers. Larger employers with 50 or more full-time employees are required to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties. Smaller employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from this requirement.\n\nMedicaid, the government program that provides health coverage for low-income individuals, was expanded under the ACA. The eligibility for Medicaid was increased to 133% of the federal poverty level, allowing more individuals to qualify for the program.\n\nThe ACA also introduced premium and cost-sharing subsidies to help individuals and families afford health insurance. These subsidies are available to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who meet income limits. The amount of the subsidy is based on a sliding scale, with lower-income individuals receiving higher subsidies.\n\nIn addition to these provisions, the ACA includes various tax changes related to health insurance and financing health reform. These changes include taxes on individuals without coverage, increased taxes on certain healthcare-related items, and tax credits for small businesses that provide health insurance to their employees.\n\nThe ACA also created health insurance exchanges, called American Health Benefit Exchanges, where individuals and small businesses can purchase qualified health coverage. These exchanges are administered by either a governmental agency or a non-profit organization.\n\nThe ACA established an essential health benefits package that provides a comprehensive set of services and covers at least 60% of the actuarial value of the covered benefits. The package is defined and updated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nOverall, the Affordable Care Act aims to improve access to healthcare coverage, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the quality of healthcare for all Americans. While it has faced ongoing debates and challenges, it remains a significant piece of legislation with a profound impact on the healthcare system in the United States.",

It showcases black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching, and a glacier collapsing to symbolize the dire consequences of climate change.\n\n\"John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,\" the narrator says.\n\nThe stark black-and-white scenes transition into more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam, representing renewable energy and environmental solutions.\n\n\"Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.\"\n\nThe ad includes visuals like a newspaper headline stating \"McCain climate views clash with GOP,\" highlighting McCain's independent stance on climate change.\n\nIndeed, records from the Congressional Record confirm that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. Even before that, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Lieberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, a bill aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by implementing caps and allowing trading of emission rights.\n\nWhen introducing the bill, McCain emphasized its significance as the \"first comprehensive piece of legislation\" to tackle emission caps.\n\n\"The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \"It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Bush administration preferred voluntary efforts rather than cap-and-trade programs to address climate change.\n\nManik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, confirmed that McCain had been working on the climate change bill since 2001, but its progress was disrupted by the 9\/11 attacks. Although the Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003, receiving a 43-55 vote, Roy highlighted its significance in raising awareness and shaping the Senate's understanding of government action on global warming.\n\n\"It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forcing the Senate to focus on it when nobody else thought it made sense, and he did it with strong opposition from the White House,\" Roy said.\n\nHe praised McCain as \"a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.\"\n\nBased on the evidence presented, it can be concluded that McCain's statement on his early involvement in addressing climate change is true.",

But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine \u2014 most likely by a lot,\" Buffett wrote. \"To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 and 25 percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\nBuffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\nBefore we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.",

    "text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates is considering deploying an additional 3,000 Marines to Afghanistan in order to counter any potential spring offensive by Taliban militants, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell, this proposal is currently under consideration by Secretary Gates. \"He will review it thoroughly before providing his approval,\" Morrell stated.\n\nOver the past two years, violence in Afghanistan has escalated, with the Taliban engaging in a guerilla war in the south and east, alongside high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.\n\nIn an effort to address the escalating violence, Gates has been urging NATO allies to contribute more troops to Afghanistan. However, if the Secretary of Defense endorses this proposal, it will indicate that Washington has acknowledged the need to provide a significant proportion of additional combat forces.\n\nTo respond to the increased violence, Gates had previously ordered a surge in U.S. forces in early 2007, resulting in a record-high of 27,000 troops currently stationed in Afghanistan. Approximately half of these troops are part of the 40,000-strong NATO security assistance force, while the rest are involved in various missions, including counter-terrorism and training Afghan troops.\n\nWhile NATO claims to have thwarted last year's attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year. The southern province of Helmand has experienced a staggering 60 percent increase in violence, as reported by the U.S. military last month.\n\nGeoff Morrell stated that the majority of the additional Marines would be deployed to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian, and Dutch troops have been heavily engaged in combat. \"The aim is to have them in place by April to prevent a repeat of last spring's attempted comeback by the Taliban,\" Morrell explained. \"This deployment is a one-time, seven-month mission.\"\n\nFollowing his meeting with allies in Scotland last month, Secretary Gates hinted at a shift away from pressing NATO nations to contribute combat troops, given the political challenges they face. He suggested that allies should focus on supporting other aspects of the mission, such as rebuilding Afghanistan. This change in approach places a greater burden on the United States in terms of combat responsibilities.\n\n\"The commander on the ground requires additional forces, and since our allies are unable to provide them, we are now considering shouldering some of that additional load,\" Morrell added.\n\nThe Taliban government was ousted by U.S.-led forces in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nMorrell mentioned that the plan to deploy the Marines would be included in a schedule of deployment proposals to be presented to Secretary Gates on Friday.\n\nThe plan involves sending a Marine Air Ground Task Force to combat the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, along with deploying a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.\n\nAccording to a U.S. military official, the Joint Staff of the Pentagon developed this plan in response to a request from Admiral William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East. The proposal also enjoys the support of Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",

With an impressive track record that includes being the No. 3 man at the Justice Department, a crime-fighting United States Attorney, and an archenemy of the Mafia, Giuliani's rise to prominence has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nNow at the helm of City Hall, Giuliani, 53, has become an omnipresent figure in New York City. Whether rushing from a burned-out building to a subway derailment or standing by the bedside of a wounded police officer, he has positioned himself as Gotham's reliable take-charge guy. One could easily view him as the city's own superhero.\n\nUndoubtedly, Giuliani's leadership has had an undeniable impact on the city. Even his adversaries begrudgingly acknowledge his effectiveness. New York City, once deemed ungovernable, is now responsive to discipline, with crime rates plummeting and the feeling of safety noticeably increasing for both residents and tourists alike.\n\nHowever, amidst his numerous accomplishments, one cannot help but notice Giuliani's temperament. He appears to hold firm in his belief of mayoral infallibility, seemingly convinced of his righteousness as long as he holds the position. The mayor's reactions can be severe when his actions or decisions are questioned, often regarding any opposition as an attack on his character. This perception has earned him a reputation for being mercurial, leaving little room for dissenting opinions.\n\nWhile Giuliani's confidence has undoubtedly contributed to his success, it is important to acknowledge the need for open dialogue and constructive criticism within any leadership role. A leader who welcomes differing viewpoints can foster growth and innovation, ultimately benefiting the community they serve.\n\nAs New York City's mayoral race continues to unfold, it will be intriguing to observe the impact of Giuliani's temperament on his campaign. Can his confident journey withstand scrutiny and appeals for alternative approaches, or will his unwavering self-assuredness become a potential liability? Only time will tell.",

This signifies an increase of 178,000 children from June 2010, reflecting a growth rate of 3.5 percent. Interestingly, this rate of growth is similar to the prior annual period (3.3 percent), indicating a stabilization in enrollment growth since the onset of the recession.\n\nWhile the number of children accessing CHIP continues to rise steadily, it appears that the rate of enrollment growth has somewhat moderated in recent times. This observation suggests that the economic downturn has had some impact on the program, potentially limiting its expansion during the analyzed period.\n\nThe report's findings highlight the significance of CHIP in providing healthcare coverage to children across the United States. As a crucial lifeline for families, CHIP plays a vital role in ensuring access to affordable healthcare, particularly for those who might not qualify for Medicaid but still require essential medical services for their children.\n\nAs the nation continues to grapple with the effects of economic uncertainty, it is essential that policymakers and healthcare stakeholders assess the CHIP program's efficacy and address any barriers to enrollment growth.

I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives to public service.\n\nTonight's debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues. And I'm going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic, since that is what a vice president or president would have to do. We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions.\n\nBy coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question. We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate - and right now, as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. OK, you got your little wave to the families in.\n\nIt's great. Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.\n\nI would like to begin with Libya. On a rather somber note, one month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9\/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear, there were no protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: What is was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It - Chris Stevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans. I can make absolutely two commitments to you and all the American people tonight. One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this. And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever - wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.\n\nWhen you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That's caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day. On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 - he ended it. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.\n\nWith regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one. And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, \"My highest priority is to get bin Laden.\"\n\nPrior to the election, prior to the - him being sworn in, said, \"I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.\" He didn't understand it was more than about taking a murderer off the battlefield. It was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know, if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell if need be. And lastly, the president of the United States has - has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan? \n\nRYAN: We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.\n\nHe went to the U.N. and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times - he talked about the YouTube video.\n\nLook, if we're hit by terrorists we're going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an Al Qaida cell with arms?\n\nThis is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.\n\nWith respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration. Let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement. We don't have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get one. That's what we are talking about.\n\nNow, when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get.\n\nNow, with respect to Afghanistan, the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want it do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad, and that's what's happening here.\n\nRYAN: This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself, but unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem. And that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the (inaudible) more chaotic us less safe.\n\nRADDATZ: I just want to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and you're talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness; talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?\n\nRYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let's recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will - it's never too early to speak out for our values.\n\nWe should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights.\n\nAnd we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we're cutting down on defense, it makes us more weak. It projects weakness. And when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks, and are allies are less willing to...\n\n[CROSSTALK]\n\nBIDEN: With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: And why is that so?\n\nBIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all...\n\nRADDATZ: Be specific.\n\nBIDEN: I will be very specific.

Under-investment, lack of quality education, and limited political power have contributed to the vulnerabilities faced by these communities.\n\nIn order to address these barriers and build ladders of opportunity, a comprehensive commitment to equity and opportunity for African American communities is needed. This commitment includes creating jobs, investing in transit and infrastructure, expanding access to capital for black entrepreneurs, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and raising the minimum wage.\n\nHomeownership and access to quality pre-school education are also essential components of this commitment. Additionally, ending the school-to-prison pipeline and focusing on criminal justice reform are crucial steps in dismantling the systemic racism that persists in our society.\n\nThis commitment requires holding leaders accountable and ensuring that promises are translated into action. It necessitates a sustained effort to build trust, cooperation, and respect between law enforcement and communities. The right to vote should also be protected, as Republican efforts to impose barriers on black voters continue to threaten our democracy.\n\nIt is important for Democrats, especially those asking for votes from the African American community, to acknowledge the realities and concerns of black Americans and to demonstrate a sustained commitment to addressing these issues. White Americans must also listen to and empathize with the experiences and challenges faced by African Americans.\n\nEnding systemic racism is a collective effort that requires contributions from all individuals and communities. It is a moral imperative for us to work towards a society where everyone has equal opportunities and where justice is not determined by the color of one's skin.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial to recognize the progress that has been made, but also important to acknowledge the work that still needs to be done to break down barriers for African Americans. With sustained commitment, empathy, and a shared sense of purpose, we can build a future that is far better than our past."

    "text":"CLEVELAND \u2014 On the eve of accepting the Republican nomination for president, Donald J. Trump has raised concerns regarding his commitment to automatically defend NATO allies in the event of an attack. Trump stated that he would first evaluate their contributions to the alliance before deciding to come to their aid.\n\nWhen questioned about Russia's threatening activities, particularly affecting the Baltic States, Trump acknowledged that he would assess whether these nations have fulfilled their obligations to the United States before deciding on intervention.\n\nExamining whether NATO allies have met their responsibilities before offering assistance appears to be a departure from traditional American foreign policy. Trump's stance aligns with his previous statements threatening to withdraw American forces from both Europe and Asia if allied nations fail to contribute more to their protection.\n\nThe Republican candidate also made it clear that he would not pressure authoritarian allies, such as Turkey, to cease purges of political adversaries or crackdown on civil liberties. Trump suggested that the United States ought to prioritize fixing internal issues before attempting to influence the behavior of other nations.\n\nThis marked the first instance where a major candidate for president has proposed conditioning the United States' defense of its major allies. Trump's remarks have added another layer of uncertainty to America's long-standing commitment to the NATO alliance.",

    "text":"In a candid interview in the Oval Office with AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace, President Donald Trump discussed a range of topics, including his first 100 days in office, the release of American charity worker Aya Hijazi, his relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and his plans for tax reform and the renegotiation of NAFTA. Here are the key highlights from the interview:\n\nRelease of Aya Hijazi:\nPresident Trump revealed that he had asked the Egyptian government to release Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in Egypt for nearly three years. He stated that he did not strike any deal with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, but simply asked him to look into the case. President Trump also noted that the release of Hijazi and seven other individuals was a \u201cgreat thing to see.\"\n\nRelationship with Angela Merkel:\nPresident Trump spoke highly of his relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, stating that they had \"unbelievable chemistry\" despite their disagreements on NATO payments and immigration. He discussed an incident in which he had reportedly ignored calls to shake Merkel's hand, stating that he had already shaken her hand four times during their meeting. He emphasized that he had developed great relationships with all world leaders, including el-Sissi.\n\nPerceptions of the Presidency:\nPresident Trump dismissed the significance of the 100-day benchmark, stating that it was an \"artificial barrier\" that does not hold much meaning. He expressed confidence in the relationships he has established with world leaders and claimed that he should be given high marks for this achievement. According to the President, his interactions with world leaders, particularly his dealings with China, have been positively received, despite criticisms over his approach to NATO and his push for member countries to increase their contributions.\n\nTax Reform and Obamacare:\nPresident Trump revealed that his administration would be announcing its tax reform plan on Wednesday, aiming to unveil a comprehensive plan for both businesses and individuals. He compared his efforts on healthcare to those of former President Obama, stating that he had been working on healthcare for 60 days, whereas Obama had taken 17 months to pass the Affordable Care Act. He emphasized that his administration is laying the foundation for future policy accomplishments.\n\nBorder Wall and NAFTA:\nRegarding the border wall with Mexico, President Trump stated that it would be built, either through renegotiation or termination of NAFTA. He indicated that the cost of the wall would be significantly less than the estimated $24 billion, and that he hoped to have it built for $10 billion or less. President Trump also mentioned his administration's goal to crack down on criminal gangs, particularly MS-13, and secure the border to prevent drug trafficking.\n\nIran Nuclear Deal:\nPresident Trump accused Iran of breaking the \"spirit\" of the nuclear accord by engaging in destabilizing activities in the Middle East. While he did not explicitly state that the U.S. would withdraw from the deal, he noted that it was a possibility. He declined to comment on discussions with European leaders regarding the agreement.\n\nDreamers and Immigration:\nIn response to a question about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and Dreamers, President Trump stated that his administration's policy is to focus on capturing and deporting criminals, rather than targeting the Dreamers. He assured that Dreamers should \"rest easy\" and that there are no immediate plans to change their status.\n\nThe interview with President Trump covered a wide range of topics, providing insight into his thoughts on foreign policy, immigration, and his first 100 days in office. The President discussed his accomplishments, highlighted his priorities, and emphasized the importance of relationships with world leaders in achieving his goals.",

    "text":"I came to Washington to fight for a smaller government and get spending under control, not shut the government down. In fact, I have repeatedly voted to fund the government in the last few days.\n\nThe shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.\n\nUnfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge.\n\nI want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is.\n\nShutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding \u2014 it doesn't even touch mandatory funding.\n\nSince its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare.\n\nObamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs, and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.\n\nIn the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row. We need to continue to take steps forward, shedding off our \"excessive funding weight\" one pound at a time. That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year.\n\nWe need to get the government running again and end this shutdown so that our communities can get back on their feet.\n\nRep. Dennis Ross, R-Lakeland, represents the 15th Congressional District that covers part of western Polk and eastern Hillsborough counties, including Brandon and the University of South Florida.

    "description":"As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once",
    "text":"As the hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders continues to grow, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting that the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. CNN's Jake Tapper brought up this issue in an interview with Sanders on July 5, alluding to an attack ad by a pro-Martin O'Malley group that claimed Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which included background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases.\n\nThe Brady Act, which became a landmark piece of gun control legislation, mandated a five-day waiting period for anyone wanting to buy a handgun while local law enforcement conducted criminal background checks. Before the bill became law, it underwent several transformations. Sanders, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it multiple times, almost always in opposition.\n\nIn May 1991, Sanders voted against a version of the bill that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House. The Senate later decreased the waiting period to five days, and in November 1991, Sanders again voted against that version. Although it passed in the House, it did not receive enough votes in the Senate. The bill remained in limbo during 1992.\n\nAfter several amendments, a version of the bill was reintroduced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders once again voted against that version but voted for an amendment that imposed an instant background check instead (although the technology for instant checks did not exist at the time). He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods but voted for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.\n\nThe final compromise version of the Brady bill, which included an interim five-day waiting period while an instant background check system was installed, was passed and signed into law on November 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.\n\nSanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, explained that Sanders opposed the Brady bill for two reasons. First, he believed that a national waiting period was federal overreach. Second, he was representing the will of the people of Vermont.\n\nSanders' home state, Vermont, has a high gun ownership rate and lenient gun control laws. Sanders' voting record on guns reflects the preferences of his constituents, as well as his own personal views.\n\nExperts agree that Sanders' stance on guns is more moderate compared to his Democratic rivals. While he advocates for more gun regulation than the current U.S. policies, he recognizes the preferences of his constituents and does not prioritize gun control as a key issue.\n\nOverall, the claim made in the attack ad that Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill and background checks and waiting periods is mostly true. Sanders did vote against the bill multiple times, but he also voted in favor of an amendment that included an instant background check and against repealing state background checks.",

    "title":"In a recent address from the Rose Garden, President mentioned the need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy. The strategy aims to produce more oil and gas domestically while also focusing on biofuels, fuel-efficient cars, solar power, wind power, and other renewable energy sources.\n\nThe President emphasized the immediate need to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil, which has led to consistent spikes in gas prices. As gas prices rise, families across the country face additional financial burdens on their daily commutes and essential tasks like grocery shopping.\n\nWhile some politicians claim that increased drilling will lead to lower gas prices, the President pointed out that the United States is already producing more oil under his administration than in the past eight years. Despite these efforts, the US only holds 2 percent of the world's proven oil reserves while consuming over 20 percent. Consequently, the country remains reliant on foreign oil, resulting in price fluctuations due to global trends and geopolitical instability.\n\nAddressing the issue of manipulation in oil markets, the President expressed concern about speculators artificially creating oil shortages to drive prices higher, enabling them to make quick profits. He stressed that protecting consumers from such practices is crucial and called on Congress to support measures to crack down on illegal activities in energy markets.\n\nTo strengthen oversight, the President announced several actions his administration is taking, including working with various enforcement agencies to prevent illegal activity and manipulation of the market. He also requested Congress to provide funding for increased monitoring and enforcement of energy markets. Furthermore, he urged Congress to enhance penalties for illegal activities, increasing financial penalties and making them applicable per violation and for every day a violation occurs. Additionally, the President recommended granting the agency overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excessive speculation.\n\nWhile acknowledging that these steps alone will not immediately reduce gas prices, the President believes they are essential in preventing market manipulation and safeguarding American consumers. In the meantime, his administration will take executive actions to analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and implement consumer protections under Wall Street reform more efficiently.\n\nThe President concluded by reiterating his commitment to pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. He emphasized the importance of reducing the country's dependence on foreign oil and highlighted the progress made in decreasing oil imports. However, he cautioned that more work needs to be done, and he will continue to prioritize American workers, technology, ingenuity, and energy in solving the issue of energy dependency."

They worry that he may decide to fire them or report them to immigration authorities. The workers expressed frustration at Trump's portrayal of immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, emphasizing that they are hardworking individuals trying to build a better life in the US. Some even pointed out that they are risking their lives and health by working on the construction site.\n\nIn response to questions, a Trump Organization spokeswoman stated that the company and its contractors comply with all applicable US immigration laws. The lead contractor, Lend Lease, requires all contractors working on the project to follow federal, state, and local laws. However, neither the Trump Organization nor Lend Lease commented on the specific issue of undocumented workers on the site.\n\nTrump's comments on illegal immigration have sparked controversy and led to several of his business partners severing ties with him. This highlights the complexity and polarizing nature of the immigration issue, not just for Trump but for the entire Republican presidential field. While his comments may resonate with conservative activists, they are less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate, which has caused concern among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding Trump's comments has brought tension and worry to the construction site where immigrant workers are striving to build a better future for themselves and their families. It remains to be seen how these comments and the backlash against them will impact Trump's presidential campaign and the perception of his business ventures.",

    "text":"e wake of the devastating terrorist attack in Brussels, Hillary Clinton delivered a speech on counterterrorism at Stanford University, emphasizing the need for steady leadership and solidarity with European allies in the fight against ISIS.\n\nClinton started her speech by expressing gratitude to Mike, the person who introduced her, for his service and partnership during her time as secretary of state. She then reminisced about her experience bringing her daughter Chelsea to visit Stanford when she was considering schools, and how she knew instantly that it was the right choice for her. She also mentioned the pride she feels as a mother and alumna, envisioning her granddaughter wearing Stanford's signature Cardinal red.\n\nTurning to the topic at hand, Clinton acknowledged the recent terrorist attack in Brussels and the tragic loss of life. She highlighted the real and urgent threat of terrorism, emphasizing that it knows no boundaries and that Americans have legitimate reasons to worry about their own safety. She recounted the various locations that have been targeted by terrorists in the past year alone and stressed the heinous actions and objectives of ISIS.\n\nClinton argued that walls will not protect against this threat and that containment is not enough \u2013 ISIS must be defeated. She identified this challenge as one of the most significant tasks that the next president will face. The new commander-in-chief will have to make crucial decisions that will impact the lives of Americans and people worldwide.\n\nThe speech was divided into three key points. Firstly, Clinton emphasized the need for a nimble and far-reaching response to an adversary that continually adapts and operates across multiple theaters. She mentioned her three-part plan to defeat ISIS, which includes intensifying the air campaign against ISIS, supporting local forces on the ground, pursuing political resolutions in Syria and Iraq, dismantling the global network of terror, and strengthening defenses and resilience at home.\n\nSecondly, Clinton stressed the importance of reinforcing alliances, specifically highlighting the critical role of NATO and the need to support and collaborate with European partners. She argued that turning our back on alliances or treating them as a protection racket would be counterproductive and weaken American leadership.\n\nLastly, Clinton discussed the need to focus on strategies that have proven effective, rejecting offensive and inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims. She praised the efforts of American Muslim communities in preventing radicalization and argued that they are a vital defense against terrorism. Clinton condemned proposals such as treating American Muslims as criminals and racially profiling predominantly-Muslim neighborhoods. She also expressed her commitment to maintaining the ban on torture and the importance of adhering to high standards as a nation.\n\nIn conclusion, Clinton called for strong, smart, and steady leadership in the fight against ISIS. She said that America can rally allies and partners like no other country and that by maintaining alliances and partnerships, the United States will succeed in defeating ISIS and ensuring the safety of its people and its values.",

Follow along as we provide the transcript along with our commentary on the statements made by the candidates. \n\nModerators Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper began the debate by asking each candidate a question about their behavior and its effect on today's youth. Hillary Clinton acknowledged the concerns raised by teachers and parents about the negative tone of the campaign. She emphasized the importance of unity, respect, and celebrating diversity in order to create a positive environment for children. Donald Trump agreed with Clinton's statement and expressed his frustration with the state of the country. He vowed to make America great again by addressing issues such as the economy, immigration, and law enforcement. \n\nThe conversation then shifted to the recently released tape in which Trump made lewd comments about women. Cooper challenged Trump's assertion that it was just \"locker room talk\" by pointing out that his comments described sexual assault. Trump denied actually committing those acts and expressed his focus on defeating ISIS and making America safe and prosperous. Clinton criticized Trump's behavior towards women and highlighted the disrespectful and offensive language he has used throughout the campaign. She emphasized the need for positive role models for today's youth.\n\nThe candidates continued to clash on various issues, including Trump's proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Clinton defended the reforms made by the ACA, stating that it provided health insurance to millions of Americans and protected individuals with pre-existing conditions. Trump criticized the ACA and called it a disaster, promising to repeal and replace it with a more affordable and effective alternative.\n\nThe debate became heated when Clinton addressed the issue of her private email server. Trump accused Clinton of deleting thousands of emails and called for a special prosecutor to investigate her actions. Clinton defended herself by stating that she took responsibility for the mistake and that there is no evidence of classified information being mishandled. \n\nThroughout the debate, both candidates traded accusations and made claims about each other's fitness for office. The audience was reminded not to applaud or disrupt the discussion. The moderators also allowed questions from online viewers, focusing on topics such as healthcare and the economy. \n\nThe debate ended with Clinton calling for fact-checking of Trump's statements in real-time and Trump promising to make America great again by addressing various issues. The candidates' exchanges highlighted the deep divide between them and the contentious nature of the election.",

    "text":"April 18, 2010 \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton recently granted an exclusive interview with \"This Week,\" where he addressed various topics including his mistakes as president, the dangers of political rhetoric, Supreme Court nominations, Middle East peace negotiations, and the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nOne of the main topics discussed was the recent accusation by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh that Clinton \"set the stage for violence\" with a speech regarding political rhetoric. Clinton firmly dismissed Limbaugh's accusation, stating that it \"doesn't make any sense.\" He emphasized that while political dissent and argument are crucial in democracy, individuals must also take responsibility for the potential consequences of their words. Clinton expressed concern about threats against President Obama and Congress, cautioning against careless language that could incite violence.\n\nReflecting on his presidency, Clinton admitted to making mistakes in relation to financial regulation. He acknowledged that he was wrong to have taken the advice of his Treasury secretaries, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, on the issue of unregulated financial instruments called derivatives. Clinton now recognizes that their argument, which claimed that derivatives did not require further regulation due to being expensive and limited to a small group of sophisticated investors, was flawed. He expressed regret for not attempting to regulate derivatives during his time in office, attributing the lack of action to the Republican majority in Congress.\n\nRegarding the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice, Clinton offered advice to President Obama. He suggested that a robe should not be a requirement for the position, stating that it is important for the nominee to be smart, competent, and understand the lives of ordinary people. Clinton recommended considering diversity in the selection process, including representation of different religions and genders on the court.\n\nClinton expressed his satisfaction with the passage of the health care reform bill, likening his feelings to how Teddy Roosevelt would have felt seeing his cousin Franklin sign legislation in areas he had advocated. He and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, personally lobbied for the passage of the bill.\n\nCommenting on the upcoming midterm elections, Clinton drew parallels to the political climate of 1994 when Democrats faced major losses in Congress. While he acknowledged the intense political dissent, he predicted that the outcome of the election would be less dramatic than in '94, stating that he did not believe Republicans would win either house.\n\nIn terms of the Middle East peace process, Clinton refrained from giving public advice to President Obama to keep his options open, but stressed the need to push both sides to engage in serious negotiations. He expressed his willingness to strongly support any peace plan proposed by the administration, even if it faced resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, Bill Clinton's interview covered a range of topics, from admitting to mistakes in financial regulation to discussing the dangers of political rhetoric and offering advice on the Supreme Court nomination, Middle East peace process, and upcoming midterm elections.",

    "text":"In a recent campaign rally, Mitt Romney expressed his support for coal miners and their jobs, emphasizing the importance of coal-fired power plants in Ohio and the surrounding areas. Romney argued that the environmental regulations implemented by President Barack Obama's administration could potentially lead to job losses and increased electricity costs for residents of Ohio.\n\nHowever, the Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's statements, asserting that his position on coal has drastically changed since his time as the governor of Massachusetts. They specifically referenced quotes from Romney in February 2003, shortly after he was elected governor, where he condemned certain coal-fired power plants in Massachusetts, claiming they were responsible for fatalities and posed significant health risks.\n\nThe Obama campaign highlighted three key statements made by Romney during a heated debate over the future of the Salem Harbor Power Station, a coal-burning plant in Boston:\n\n1. \"That plant kills people\" - Romney's reference to Salem Harbor Power Station.\n2. \"I will not create jobs that kill people\" - Romney's commitment to prioritizing public health over job creation.\n3. \"If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health\" - Romney's unwavering stance on safeguarding public health.\n\nIt is important to note that Massachusetts had implemented new rules in 2001 to reduce emissions from power plants, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury. Salem Harbor Power Station was among the plants singled out as significant polluters, and a Harvard study estimated that it caused various health issues, including premature deaths, emergency room visits, asthma attacks, and upper respiratory symptoms.\n\nWhile some individuals disputed the figures from the Harvard study, claiming they were based on unproven modeling, the study's methodology has since been replicated and is respected by health scientists. Romney, at the time, seemed to accept these findings, as evidenced by his own statements in news releases and his hiring of environmental experts from the Conservation Law Foundation.\n\nTo ascertain the accuracy of the Obama campaign's claim and the severity of Romney's views on coal emissions, experts and environmentalists were consulted. They confirmed that Romney's condemnation of the Salem Harbor plant was part of his wider commitment to emissions reductions, which aligns with the standards later proposed by the U.S. EPA, the same standards Romney now criticizes.\n\nFurthermore, an analysis comparing the emissions levels of Salem Harbor Power Station to those of coal-fired plants in the Midwest revealed that the former had lower or comparable emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, two pollutants known to be hazardous to health. This implies that if one were to support the regulations Romney advocated for in 2003, they would likely also support similar measures on a national scale.\n\nIn conclusion, while Romney made reference to a specific power plant, his comments were part of a broader emissions-reduction initiative that he championed as governor, indicating a consistent viewpoint on coal emissions and public health. Therefore, the Obama campaign's claim about Romney's stance on coal, although focusing on a single plant, holds significant truth based on historical records and contextual analysis.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim made by the Obama campaign rates Mostly True.",

    "text":"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warmly welcomes the news of the 10,000th Syrian refugee settling in the United States this week and urges greater global solidarity ahead of upcoming summits focused on addressing the unprecedented refugee crisis worldwide.\n\nAcknowledging the United States' longstanding tradition of offering sanctuary to people fleeing persecution, Shelly Pitterman, the UNHCR Regional Representative in the United States, commended the nation's leadership, stating, \"The arrival of the 10,000th Syrian refugee marks yet another testament to this exemplary initiative.\"\n\nExpressing gratitude towards the communities in the United States that have willingly opened their doors, Pitterman also recognized the tireless efforts of civil society partners in facilitating humanitarian aid. Nonetheless, he emphasized the urgent need for increased support for Syrian refugees and the global crisis, which has witnessed an unparalleled number of individuals seeking refuge from persecution.\n\nAs of the end of 2015, a staggering 65.3 million people, driven by war, conflict, and persecution, were forcibly displaced worldwide\u2014a record high. Among them, the Syrian refugee crisis stands as the most extensive, with over 4.8 million Syrians seeking sanctuary in neighboring countries. Regrettably, these host countries are already strained, causing an increasing number of refugees to live below national poverty lines.\n\nTo assist the most vulnerable amongst the displaced population and to alleviate some of the burden on countries hosting refugees, UNHCR has called upon governments to offer resettlement to those facing the highest risks. Thus far, resettlement countries have pledged more than 220,000 places for Syrians through resettlement and other humanitarian admission programs. It is estimated that approximately 40 percent of the 1.19 million refugees globally requiring resettlement\u2014roughly 478,000 Syrians\u2014are in urgent need of a new home.\n\nRecognizing the limited opportunities for resettlement, UNHCR reserves this option for individuals who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and those with special medical needs. In an effort to ensure the safety and security of all refugees accepted for resettlement, the UNHCR meticulously screens and identifies suitable candidates before referring them to their receiving country. In the case of the United States, all referred refugees undergo a rigorous process, including face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, extensive identity checks, and multiple security screenings.\n\nUNHCR urges a collective global effort to provide Syrian refugees with more safe and regular pathways for admission. The upcoming United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on September 19th and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on September 20th will provide platforms for countries to demonstrate solidarity with refugee-hosting nations worldwide by offering legal avenues for Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups to access safety and protection through resettlement and other admission programs.\n\n\"Resettlement, supported by continued humanitarian funding, is a vital form of solidarity with countries hosting refugees and should be expanded on a global scale,\" emphasized Pitterman.",

    "text":"Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back with a claim that he provides universal health care. However, a closer look at his plan reveals that it falls short of a guaranteed universal coverage.\n\nBoth Democratic presidential candidates share a lot in common when it comes to health care, but one key difference is Clinton's inclusion of a universal mandate. This means that individuals would be legally required to purchase health insurance. Obama's plan, on the other hand, only includes a mandate to insure children and lacks a mandate for adults, similar to the plans proposed by Clinton and Edwards. According to health policy expert Kenneth Thorpe, this difference is likely to result in fewer people being insured under Obama's plan.\n\nObama's decision to exclude a mandate for adults is seen as a more cautious approach to avoid penalizing those with modest incomes. If premiums do not decrease significantly after implementing reforms, these individuals may still be unable to afford insurance. Obama argues that mandating them to buy insurance, and subsequently fining them if they don't comply, would only punish the poor and leave them uninsured. Instead, he believes that his plan will lower costs enough to persuade a large number of the estimated 47 million uninsured Americans to voluntarily sign up, with a mandate potentially being added later on.\n\nAlthough Obama claims his plan will create market conditions for universal availability of health care, it does not guarantee it. While his approach may lead to increased coverage, nothing in his plan provides an assurance of universal health care. Therefore, his claim is considered Barely True.",

    "description":"When China destroyed its own satellite, outrageand debrisrapidly encircled the globe. Was the Sat Kill a policy weapon or the start of an arms race in space?",
    "text":"At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small\u2014just 6 ft. long\u2014a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.\n\nIt was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and\u2014boom\u2014obliterated it. \"It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,\" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.\n\nFor China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. \"The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,\" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. \"China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there.\" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of anti-satellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.\n\nINTERNATIONAL THREAT\n\nFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. \"Space debris is a huge problem,\" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed.\" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.\n\nAlthough the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials\u2014reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance\u2014chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.\n\nBattlefield: Space Media Platforms Design Team\n\n1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.\n\n2] Experts believe a four-stage, solid\u00c2\u00ad-fuel launch vehicle\u2014thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2\u2014boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.\n\n3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.\n\n4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.\n\n5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.\n\nSome details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information, and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nAMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS\n\nEvery industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television, and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.\n\nSome satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft\u2014including spy sats\u2014are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile\u2014yet it can be done. \"You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,\" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. \"You'd need ICBM-size boosters\u2014hundreds of them.\"\n\nSuch an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. \"There'd be so much debris up there,\" Clark says, \"that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War, spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. \"The consensus,\" Clark says, \"was that anybody could look at anybody else.\"\n\nDiagram: China's anti-satellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites\u2014roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.\n\nTo develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.\n\nOver the next several decades, the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985, the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was canceled before the air-launched system could be perfected.\n\nThat same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.\n\nSome $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle\u2014a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.\n\nDestroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalSecurity says, \"It's an act of war.\"\n\nU.S. Sat Kill Arsenal\n\n- Perhaps the most spectacular test\u2014known as Starfish Prime\u2014occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.\n\n- The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985 when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\n- In 1997, the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy and eventually canceled the program.\n\n- The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat\u2014but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.\n\nSENDING A MESSAGE\n\nSo why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. \"The experiment is not targeted at any other country,\" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.\n\nSome experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that \"The United States considers space capabilities... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.\"\n\nThe United States \"basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,\" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: \"Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.\"\n\nIn that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. \"The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.\"\n\nPike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.\n\n\"The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,\" Pike says. \"Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time.\" A half-dozen sats, Pike says\u2014that's all it would take. \"Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nIn that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its war plan is feasible.\n\nAMERICA'S TRUMP CARD\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. \"It was a mistake,\" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, \"It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,\" Vick says. \"It is a threat, and the test showed that.\" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat, and China has only 60 satellites\u2014few of these are worth shooting down.\n\nAmerica's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all\u2014they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, \"just nothing to shoot at.\"\n\nFor now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.\n\nWaste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.\n\nJULY 2007 The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.\n\nJANUARY 2008 A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.\n\nIt's called the Kessler Syndrome\u2014the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. \"Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,\" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know.\" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles\u2014and Kessler's looming threat.",

    "text":"During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made controversial remarks about voters who support President Barack Obama. In the secret video obtained by Mother Jones, Romney can be heard dismissing Obama supporters as freeloaders who pay no taxes and believe that the government should take care of them. He suggests that these individuals lack personal responsibility and are dependent on the government.\n\nRomney stated that there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for Obama no matter what, referring to them as people who are dependent upon the government and consider themselves victims. He argued that they believe they are entitled to healthcare, food, housing, and other benefits provided by the government. Romney added that these individuals do not pay income taxes.\n\nThe video also revealed Romney's views on other topics. He commented on his family background, expressing that if his father had been born to Mexican parents, he would have a better chance at winning the election. Romney emphasized his self-made millionaire status and stated that being born in America with privileges was the greatest gift one could have.\n\nRomney acknowledged that he was facing challenges in winning over Hispanic voters but believed that women were open to supporting him. He advised the donors at the fundraiser to raise millions of dollars to support his campaign.\n\nThe Republican candidate revealed that his campaign was hesitant to attack Obama aggressively, as they did not want to alienate independent voters who had previously supported the president. Romney indicated that his campaign aimed to convince these voters that Obama's policies had failed, without vilifying the president.\n\nRomney boasted about the experienced consultants on his team, mentioning that some had worked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He expressed confidence that winning the election would lead to economic growth and positive market reactions.\n\nDuring the fundraiser, Romney stated that the campaign purposefully limited the appearances of his wife, Ann Romney, so that people would not get tired of her. He also turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live, as he believed it would make him appear slapstick and not presidential.\n\nThese remarks by Romney, made in the presence of wealthy donors, were considered controversial and showed a different side of him compared to his public campaign messaging. The video caused significant backlash and raised questions about Romney's views and ability to relate to a broad spectrum of voters.",

    "text":"In an exclusive interview with ABC News on February 4, 2011, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky expressed his dissatisfaction with the House GOP budget proposal, stating that it falls short in addressing the federal deficit.\n\nAccording to Paul, the plan put forward by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin does not adequately tackle the issue at hand. He noted a disconnect among Republicans, stating that while they advocate for a balanced budget, they may not be ready to discuss the necessary spending cuts.\n\nReleased on Thursday, Ryan's proposal aims to cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of the fiscal year 2011, which concludes on September 30.\n\nDuring the extensive interview conducted aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul declared himself a \"true believer\" and expressed his commitment to the principles of the Tea Party movement. He emphasized that his dedication to these values supersedes his affiliation with the Republican party. Additionally, Paul did not rule out the possibility of running for president in the future and suggested a potential reduction in U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nPaul has presented his own plan to slash spending by $500 billion in the current year. His proposal includes significant across-the-board cuts, such as an 83 percent reduction in funding for the Department of Education, a 6 percent reduction for the Department of Defense, and an elimination of all foreign aid. However, Paul views these cuts as merely a starting point.\n\nPaul shared feedback he has received at tea party events, where attendees consistently demand more substantial action. He said they express their concerns, stating, \"It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?\"\n\nWhile defending his position on ending all foreign aid, including the $3 billion given annually to Israel, Paul clarified that he remains supportive of the country. However, he stressed that it is not prudent to borrow money to provide assistance, even to friendly nations.\n\nAddressing critics who argue against discontinuing aid to Israel, Paul maintained that the country possesses sufficient resources to sustain itself economically. He stated, \"I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so.\"\n\nPaul also praised Israel's military capabilities, stating they outmatch those of their neighboring countries. \"I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country. I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies,\" he remarked.\n\nRegarding troop levels in Afghanistan, Paul expressed his belief that the decision falls within the purview of the president. However, he personally believes that a smaller presence would be sufficient.\n\nClearing any confusion about his political affiliations, Paul asserted that he prioritizes being a Tea Party activist over identifying as a Republican. He emphasized that certain issues in the nation's capital transcend party lines, stating, \"There are always problems in our nation's capital that are more important than party affiliation, and I will always believe that.\" When questioned about the importance of party loyalty, Paul firmly responded, \"If you ask me what's more important, tackling our nation's deficit, our nation's debt problems or being a Republican, I would say tackling the debt.\"",

    "text":"President Donald Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric on implementing stricter taxes for hedge funds may not align with his actual plan, raising concerns about the effectiveness of his proposed measures.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign and even after taking office, Trump repeatedly criticized the hedge-fund industry, claiming that it exploits tax loopholes and benefits from preferential treatment. He vowed to close these loopholes and make hedge funds pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nHowever, a closer analysis of Trump's tax plan reveals a different story. Rather than cracking down on hedge-fund tax practices, his proposed reforms primarily focus on lowering corporate tax rates and providing relief for high-income individuals. This discrepancy begs the question: is Trump's tough talk on hedge-fund taxes nothing more than political posturing?\n\nWhile the proposed reforms might have positive impacts on the overall economy, critics argue that they do not address the specific issues surrounding hedge-fund taxation. The lack of specific measures targeting this industry raises doubts about Trump's commitment to tackling the concerns he previously expressed.\n\nHedge funds are known for utilizing complex strategies to minimize their tax obligations legally. Critics argue that these practices allow hedge-fund managers to pay lower effective tax rates compared to many middle-class Americans. This income inequality has fueled public anger and calls for reform.\n\nThe tension between Trump's tough rhetoric and his actual plan is further amplified by the presence of former hedge-fund managers within his administration. Critics argue that influential figures from the industry, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, may influence policy decisions in favor of their former colleagues instead of implementing reforms.\n\nAs the President continues to push for his ambitious tax reforms, it remains to be seen whether he will truly address the concerns surrounding hedge-fund taxes. Trump's tough talk may have garnered attention, but its alignment with his actual plan is still questionable.\n\nA comprehensive and fair tax system requires a diligent and genuine effort to close any loopholes that allow certain industries to disproportionately benefit. Only time will tell if the President's words will translate into meaningful action or if his tough talk on hedge-fund taxes is merely political rhetoric aimed at appeasing the public.",

    "text":"Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism, and social mobility.\n\nIn a 2007 statement, Gingrich declared his political ideology, stating, \"It's not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.\"\n\nGingrich highlights key instances in American history to support his viewpoint. He references how the government provided railroad land grants to encourage the widespread adoption of a modern transportation system. Similarly, the Homestead Act gave away land to those willing to live on and develop it. Gingrich further points out that public-private partnerships were employed to bring telephone service and electricity to all communities in the nation. These examples demonstrate how government involvement can serve public purposes without leading to excessive bureaucracy.\n\nThis consistent theme in Gingrich's career sets him apart, highlighted by his 1984 book, \"Window of Opportunity.\" In the book, he vehemently criticizes the \"laissez-faire\" conservatism, which promotes the idea that the government should step back and let the market flourish. Gingrich argues that an opportunity society requires active government intervention to foster growth and provide equal opportunities.\n\nDespite facing criticism and encountering tumultuous political phases, Gingrich's unwavering belief in the power of limited government intervention to drive growth and social progress remains a defining aspect of his philosophy.",

    "text":"As anticipated, Texas Governor Rick Perry has officially declared his candidacy for the presidency. It comes as no surprise that his campaign will heavily emphasize faith in miracles. While these miracles may allude to biblical tales, Perry's focus will likely shift to a more secular subject if he secures the Republican nomination \u2013 the supposed economic miracle that Texas purportedly experienced during the Great Recession thanks to conservative economic policies. Perry will argue that he can replicate this success on a national scale to restore prosperity to America.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to understand that the so-called Texas miracle is nothing more than a fallacy. Moreover, the Texan experience offers no valuable lessons on how to achieve national full employment.\n\nUndeniably, Texas faced the recession slightly later than the rest of the nation, primarily due to its energy-focused economy benefitting from high oil prices in the initial half of 2008. Additionally, the state was relatively sheltered from the worst impacts of the housing crisis, attributable in part to surprisingly stringent mortgage lending regulations.\n\nWhile these factors contributed to delaying the onset of recession and minimizing the housing crisis's impact, they do not validate Texas' economic policies or suggest their effectiveness in achieving widespread national prosperity. In truth, Texas faces numerous challenges, including inadequate healthcare, high poverty rates, and a lack of economic equity. These issues cannot be ignored in any evaluation of the state's economic performance.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that conservative economic policies alone can be universally applied to revive America's economy is unfounded. Economic conditions, demographics, and social structures vary significantly across states, making a one-size-fits-all policy ineffective.\n\nIt is essential to approach claims of economic miracles with skepticism and a critical eye.

    "text":"On September 28, pastors from 20 states will take part in a protest organized by the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF), a conservative legal-advocacy group. The protest aims to challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations, including churches and religious groups, that are exempt from taxation. The restriction dictates that religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF intends to bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties if the protest leads to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) action against houses of worship.\n\nTo shed light on the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turned to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle, the David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion at The George Washington University Law School. \n\nInterviewer: Jesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life\n\n--\n\nQuestion & Answer\n\nQ: Before 1954, nonprofit organizations were allowed to endorse political candidates under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. What prompted Congress to add the restriction that now exists?\n\nA: The motivations behind Congress' decision to add the restriction in 1954 are not entirely clear. It is believed that concerns were raised about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents' political campaigns. However, as the amendment primarily targeted political contributions, rather than limiting political advocacy, its original purpose is often misconstrued.\n\nQ: Why is the Alliance Defense Fund advocating for the elimination of this restriction?\n\nA: The ADF opposes the restriction as it forces churches to choose between active political participation and accepting tax-deductible donations. If a church wants to support or oppose a specific political candidate, it would need to establish a separate organization to do so. Although this new organization would be tax-exempt, donations made to it would not be eligible for tax deductions. The ADF believes that this restriction hampers the essential role of political activity within a congregation's life. Furthermore, they argue that the IRS's enforcement of the rule, including the examination of sermons and religious messages, oversteps the boundaries between government and religion.\n\nQ: If the ADF's protest leads to a constitutional challenge, what arguments might they present in court?\n\nA: In the event of a constitutional challenge, the ADF would likely argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, as it places stricter regulations on religious organizations compared to their secular counterparts. They may also contend that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal statute that prohibits the government from imposing significant burdens on religious organizations without demonstrating a compelling government interest. Additionally, the ADF could argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, which bars content-based regulation of speech. Lastly, they might claim that IRS enforcement of the amendment infringes upon the First Amendment's Establishment Clause by necessitating the examination of sermons and religious messages, thus entangling the government with religious operations.\n\nQ: How might the government defend the 1954 amendment?\n\nA: The government would likely defend the amendment by asserting that it treats religious organizations in the same manner as other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, they would argue that the restriction does not prevent congregations from participating in campaigns; it only restricts donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. They would also contend that the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause as it only withholds a speech subsidy rather than outright restricting speech. In response to the Establishment Clause argument, the government would argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion since the IRS does not assess the theological merit of sermons but rather examines if they promote political candidates.\n\nQ: How do you foresee a court evaluating these arguments?\n\nA: Predicting how a court would decide a hypothetical case is challenging, as decisions are often dependent on specific case facts. However, looking at past precedent, it is likely that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment's application to religious organizations. In Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the amendment. The court argued that the amendment did not violate the Free Exercise or Free Speech clauses since the congregation remained free to engage in political speech and activities. This decision was influenced by previous Supreme Court cases, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990), which upheld the monetary benefit provided by 501(c)(3) status and the principle that a tax applied equally to both religious and nonreligious organizations does not impose substantial burdens on religious exercise.\n\nQ: If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that pose an issue under the First Amendment's Establishment Clause?\n\nA: This is a complex question with no definitive answer. Courts typically uphold legislative efforts that alleviate burdens on religious activity, even if the burdens do not meet the \"substantial burden\" requirement under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). While courts might be inclined to defer to Congress's judgment to exempt religious organizations from the restriction, they may also view a religion-specific exemption as favoring religious entities over non-religious ones. In the case of Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court deemed a sales tax exemption for religious publications as a violation of the Establishment Clause since it effectively subsidized religious publications. The current Supreme Court, which holds a narrower view of the Establishment Clause, might rule differently than the Texas Monthly decision. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the composition and interpretation of the court at the time.",

Welcome to the NewsHour.\n\nDAVID KEENE: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said that critics who argue that gun control measures are an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He argued that these measures are simply commonsense safety measures. What is your response to that?\n\nDAVID KEENE: I believe that gun control measures are indeed an attack on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. These measures infringe upon the rights of those who have legally purchased and use firearms and have never committed a criminal act. While every amendment, including the Second Amendment, is subject to reasonable limits, the proposed gun control measures have not been proven to have a significant impact on preventing tragedies like the one in Connecticut. We need to focus on preventing these incidents rather than imposing unnecessary restrictions on law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly recently wrote an op-ed article arguing for stricter gun control measures. How do you respond to their arguments?\n\nDAVID KEENE: They specifically mentioned assault weapons, but it's important to note that assault weapons were not involved in the Giffords shooting. The AR-15, often referred to as an assault weapon, is a semiautomatic commercial rifle and the bestselling long gun in the United States. It is used by many for sport shooting and hunting. Banning these rifles based on cosmetic features would be an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What about the argument that reducing high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing a ban on assault weapons could help reduce gun violence?\n\nDAVID KEENE: We have tried a ban on assault weapons before, and it did not make a significant difference. Additionally, there is no functional difference between an assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle. Banning them based on cosmetic features would not address the issue. Instead, we should focus on keeping firearms out of the hands of individuals who should not have them, such as those who have been adjudicated as potentially violent or mentally ill. Strengthening our background check system and addressing mental health issues can be effective ways to address gun violence without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any common ground between the NRA and the White House on gun control measures?\n\nDAVID KEENE: There is some potential for common ground, such as implementing background checks for individuals who have been adjudicated as potentially violent. The NRA has been advocating for this for the past 20 years. However, we do not support banning rifles that we believe would not make a significant difference in preventing gun violence. We also oppose the creation of a national gun registry.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Recent polls show that even in gun-owning households, there is support for measures such as reducing high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing background checks. How do you respond to these findings?\n\nDAVID KEENE: The Gallup poll actually showed no change in support for a ban on \"assault weapons.\" This indicates that people are more informed than politicians give them credit for. While there may be initial support for these measures, I believe that as the discussion evolves, people will recognize the importance of protecting Second Amendment rights while also preventing gun violence through more effective means like stronger background checks and addressing mental health issues.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you for joining us, David Keene, president of the NRA.\n\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, thank you.",

It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.\nNow, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at. And you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns?

Mark Kelly, her husband. They wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: \"Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.\"\nAnd they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.\nDAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.\nBut the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.\nMost people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.\nAnd she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.\nDAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?\nDAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.\nBut, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.\nIn our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.\nIt's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...\nDAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.\nBut, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?\nDAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.\nIt's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.\nBut we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.\nWhen you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keeps databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons, and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.\nTwenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\nDAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.\nMaybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...\nDAVID KEENE: Sure.\nWell, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they, in fact, train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.\nTheir crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.\nNow each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was in a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.\nAfter Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.\nNow, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.\nCan you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.\nWhy not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?\nDAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.\nSo, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.\nSo, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?\nDAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.\nBut, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.\nAnd one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.\nFine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.\nDAVID KEENE: Well, it is.\nAnd the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.\nWhen that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?\nDAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.\nBut given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.\nBut when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.\nAnd that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always. Thank you."

    "text":"By Sen. Rand Paul\n\nRumors have been circulating that President-elect Donald Trump is considering John Bolton for the position of Secretary of State. As an opponent of the Iraq war and regime change, I am concerned about this potential appointment and whether it aligns with Trump's previous stance on these issues.\n\nOne of the reasons I admired Trump during his campaign was his understanding of the mistakes made during the Iraq war and how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East, ultimately empowering Iran. However, John Bolton, a longtime member of the Washington elite, has failed to learn from these mistakes, and it is unlikely that he will do so in the future.\n\nBolton stood in opposition to Trump's advice on numerous occasions, and his foreign policy views are reminiscent of the failed policies of the past 15 years. He was a vocal supporter of overthrowing Saddam Hussein, even going so far as to say that the decision was correct 13 years after the fact. In contrast, Trump recognizes that the Iraq war destabilized the region and facilitated the rise of ISIS.\n\nFurthermore, Bolton has expressed his desire to pursue regime change in countries like Syria and Iran, similar to the failed approach in Iraq. It is clear that he has not learned from past mistakes and is out of touch with the reality in the Middle East. His lack of nuance and his insistence on all-out war make him a dangerous candidate for the position of Secretary of State.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bolton, like many of his generation, avoided serving in the military when the Vietnam draft was in effect, citing a lack of desire to die in Southeast Asia. Yet, he appears to have no qualms about sending other people's sons and daughters into harm's way.\n\nIn a time when Americans are looking for change and new thinking, Bolton represents failed foreign policy and is a menace to our national security. It is important to remember that our Constitution explicitly states that war should not be fought without the permission of Congress. As a senator, I will fulfill my constitutional duty by opposing any advocate for war, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nPresident-elect Trump campaigned on the promise to change our foreign policy, and appointing John Bolton would be a significant step back from that promise. I urge the incoming administration to reconsider this appointment and instead choose a Secretary of State who truly aligns with the desire for change and a more thoughtful approach to foreign policy.\n\nRand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.",

    "title":"In a highly anticipated statement, President Barack Obama expressed his disappointment and frustration with the Senate's failure to pass a gun control bill that would have expanded background checks. The bill, which had the support of 90 percent of Americans and was a bipartisan effort, fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThe President began his speech by acknowledging the victims of gun violence, particularly those who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was one of the first-graders killed in the tragedy, also spoke before the President.\n\nPresident Obama emphasized that the proposed legislation would not have prevented every act of violence, but it was a step forward in protecting the lives of Americans. He underscored the fact that 90 percent of Americans, including 80 percent of Republicans, supported universal background checks, which would have made it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to purchase firearms.\n\nThe President criticized the gun lobby and its allies for spreading misinformation about the bill and creating fear among lawmakers. He acknowledged the pressure faced by senators from pro-gun states but called out their lack of coherent arguments against the proposed legislation.\n\nPresident Obama highlighted the fact that the majority of senators voted in favor of the bill, but a minority was able to block it due to Senate rules. He expressed his disappointment with the failure to act and called it a \"shameful day for Washington.\"\n\nWhile the President acknowledged that the effort for gun control is not over, he emphasized the need for sustained passion and organized action from the American people. He called on supporters to let their representatives know their disappointment and to hold them accountable in future elections.\n\nPresident Obama concluded his speech by stating that change would come, driven by the memories of the victims and the demand of the American people.\n\nThe President's speech resonated with supporters of gun control, who were saddened by the Senate's decision but inspired to continue their fight for change."

    "text":"The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.\n\nDuring the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.\n\nAs it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.\n\nOn the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. \"Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?\" she asked.\n\nBrown responded, \"In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.\"\n\nWhen Walters asked him, \"Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?\" Brown said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"The whole plan?\" Walters continued.\n\n\"Yes,\" Brown said.\n\nLater, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.\n\n\"That was the most evasive answer,\" Krugman said. \"If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.\"\n\nWe wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed \"the same thing\" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts.\n\nThe consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, \"Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.\"\n\nHere are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:\n\n\u2022 Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.\n\n\u2022 Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.\n\n\u2022 Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary \"exchanges\" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.\n\n\u2022 Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\u2022 Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\u2022 Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.\n\n\u2022 Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5-to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans.\n\nThe bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.\n\n\u2022 Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.\n\n\u2022 Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers, and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (\"Cadillac\") healthcare plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.\n\n\"The Senate probably has more cost containment,\" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. \"And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.\"\n\nSo it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.",

State of siege. We take you to Wisconsin, where firefighters and teachers have stormed the capitol, lawmakers are in hiding, and the Tea Party is fighting back. Bob Woodruff with the real story, inside the battle in the heartland.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We won in November. Elections have consequences.\n\nAMANPOUR: Our roundtable will ask, will this spread around the rest of the country? As cuts get deep, who should bear the pain?\n\nAnd freedom fever, the very latest from the Middle East, where bloody protests force another key ally to do the unthinkable. My exclusive with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the young Internet revolutionaries who tell us how they engineered the fall of America's staunchest ally with American tech, not tanks. \"This Week,\" \"People Power,\" starts right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Good morning.\n\nPopulist frustration is boiling over this week, as we said, not just in the Middle East, but in the middle of this country, as well. A budget war threatens to shut down the federal government, and now union workers fighting back are tying state and local governments in knots. Ground zero: Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nABC's Bob Woodruff is there, and he joins me now with the very latest. Good morning, Bob.\n\nWOODRUFF: Good morning, Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: So there have been six days of protests there so far, state employees fighting the proposed cuts to their benefits and their union's right to bargain, Democratic legislators hiding in order to stop a vote. Bob, what's driving the people that you've met there? Does it look like there's an end in sight?\n\nWOODRUFF: Well, that's a good question. You know, this has been just a huge event. The weather is now starting to change today. They think there might be about six inches of snow today. Hopefully that's going to come to an end, as well.\n\nBut, really, the numbers are really impressive. You know, they now estimate that about 68,000 people were here yesterday. Most of them were teacher union members. But also then, for the first time yesterday, the Tea Party supporters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWOODRUFF (voice-over): Is this what the future of American politics looks like?\n\n(UNKNOWN): I don't think we've ever had anything like this.\n\n(UNKNOWN): This is unprecedented for -- for our times. WOODRUFF: In Madison, the capitol building is still swelling with protesters, a near total takeover. Tens of thousands in the streets, too, determined to thwart a bill they see as a frontal assault on public labor unions.\n\n(UNKNOWN): What's disgusting?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Union busting.\n\n(UNKNOWN): What's disgusting?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Union busting.\n\n(UNKNOWN): How do you get better teachable moments than this? If you don't like what somebody's doing, we don't just sit back and -- and watch. We don't wait four years for the next budget or election cycle. We tell them right away we don't like it.\n\nWOODRUFF: The protesters are furious with Governor Scott Walker's plan to drastically curtail the bargaining power of their unions. Outraged public workers and their allies have dominated the scene here since last Monday. But for the first time this weekend, they had company.\n\n(on-screen): Really what this is, is a tale of two rallies. You've got the one side, the union on this side, and then you come on over here to the Tea Party. So on one side, you've got kill the bill. On the other side, you've got pass the bill.\n\n(voice-over): The crowd supporting the governor, smaller in size but not in conviction, came from around the state to deliver a clear message.\n\n(UNKNOWN): But we're not going to negotiate. Why would we negotiate? We won -- we won in November. Elections have consequences. That's -- it's as simple as that. I can't make it any plainer. We won; they lost. That's what's going to happen. The bill is going to be passed.\n\nWOODRUFF: We met Lou Debraccio early in the morning, 110 miles away from the capitol, as he and a clutch of fellow Tea Party supporters boarded a bus bound for Madison. Debraccio is a small government conservative, eager for his voice to be heard in the debate.\n\nDEBRACCIO: I want to -- I want to see the state move forward. And in order to do that, many of us in the private sector have had to sacrifice and I think necessary that -- that we all share that sacrifice. It does hit home for me. My wife is a teacher. It's going to cost our family money. But it's the right thing to do, so I support it.\n\nWOODRUFF: While Debraccio was heading to town, chemistry teacher Anthony Schnell and his family were deep in their morning routine. J. SCHNELL: The immediate effect to our family is that we will make about $500 a month less on Anthony's paycheck. And we are just hanging on by our fingernails right now. My husband loves being a teacher. He's tried other things, and he loves education, he loves kids, he loves working with families. And for him to say I think I might have to leave this again is just heart-breaking, because it's his passion.\n\nA. SCHNELL: This isn't about the money. It's not about the benefits. Of course, that's going to hit us, and we don't like that. But it's really about having input in the classes, you know, having input with the school board, having input with what happens.\n\nWOODRUFF: Anthony's been coming to the protests all week, but the Tea Party's presence weighed on his mind as he approached the capitol.\n\nA. SCHNELL: I'm a little nervous about today. I just don't know what's going happen.\n\nWOODRUFF: Once inside the rotunda, he lost the butterflies and began working the crowd.\n\nA. SCHNELL: Is this a budget fight?\n\nCROWD: No.\n\nA. SCHNELL: Is this just about money?\n\nCROWD: No.\n\nA. SCHNELL: Is this about us doing the best in our classrooms?\n\nCROWD: Yes.\n\nWOODRUFF (on-screen): They're all saying this is huge. And if it happens here, it's going to happen everywhere in the rest of the country.\n\n(voice-over): In the rotunda, there is now a flavor of a '60s-era sit-in. In fact, some told us it's the biggest demonstration they've seen here since the Vietnam War.\n\n(on-screen): You doing this every day until this thing -- this bill is killed?\n\nOWEN: I think this is going to happen every day until this bill is killed. I don't think there's any way that the people in this building are going to give up the right to collective bargaining.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I'm here because this is wrong, that this sort of shotgun legislation, ramming it through, it's the wrong way to deal with problems. This isn't about me. It's about trying to do the best we can for society and communities.\n\nWOODRUFF: Do you think it's going to be peaceful? (UNKNOWN): I think so. I think the tensions are going to be high, but I think it's going to stay civil.\n\nWOODRUFF: But what if this...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Well, wait. Not civil, it's going to stay peaceful.\n\nWOODRUFF: Lou Debraccio got an earful from the pro-labor crowd as he made his way to the Tea Party demonstration.\n\nDEBRACCIO: I'm not going to change any of their minds. They're committed enough to drive here and make signs, just like they're not going to change my mind. It's not about that. So there's limited return in talking to them.\n\nWOODRUFF: Even some families are divided. Julie Hansen supports the governor. Her 13-year-old daughter does not.\n\nHANSEN: My 13-year-old is for collective bargaining. She went to school yesterday, and the teachers spoke to her about it.\n\nWOODRUFF: Think she believes it and -- or just because of the one lesson from the teacher?\n\nHANSEN: We had a pretty adamant discussion.\n\nWOODRUFF (voice-over): Jeff Strobel is here with the Tea Party. His brother-in-law is on the other side.\n\nSTROBEL: And my brother-in-law is a union worker. We had a big e-mail exchange on Facebook last night. The best thing is, it was civil, it was, you know, courteous. But we kind of tried to educate each other, but we're never going to agree. He's on this side; I'm on this side. But we can talk about it.\n\nWOODRUFF (on-screen): Still going to have a peaceful Christmas dinner together?\n\nSTROBEL: As long as there's beer there, we'll be peaceful.\n\nWOODRUFF (voice-over): Late Saturday, the governor issued a statement, turning down a compromise offer from the unions. And so here in Wisconsin, the standoff continues, for now.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" I'm Bob Woodruff in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And so is Wisconsin just the beginning? States from coast to coast are grappling with this fundamental question: In desperate economic times, which Americans should sacrifice the most? I'll put that to the roundtable coming up next.\n\nAnd later, revolt in the Middle East engulfs more of America's strongest allies, with the Obama administration struggling to stay ahead of events. I'll get an exclusive progress report from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Some of what I've heard coming out of Wisconsin, where you're just making it harder for public employees to collectively bargain generally, seems like more of an assault on unions. And I think it's very important for us to understand that public employees, they're our neighbors, they're our friends. They make a lot of sacrifices and make a big contribution. And I think it's important not to vilify them or to suggest that somehow all these budget problems are due to public employees.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: President Obama igniting a national conversation about which Americans should feel the pain of the budget axe. With pitched battles going on right now here in Washington and in statehouses from Florida to Wisconsin to California, with me now, our roundtable, George Will, Congressman Steve Southerland, a Republican freshman from Florida, he was elected to public office for the very first time last November and sent here to Washington on a mission to cut spending. Also with us, ABC senior political correspondent Jonathan Karl and political strategist Donna Brazile, who calls herself a labor Democrat.\n\nThank you all for being here. So, George, Wisconsin. Is this the sort of battle that we're going to see shaping up around the country? Is this really the sort of political and philosophical debate that's going on right now about what these cuts are going to mean?\n\nWILL: It would have been even if the president hadn't intervened. But in the span of three days, Christiane, he first submits a budget that would increase the federal deficit and, two days later, he mobilizes his party, his own political machine, and organized labor, which is an appendage to his party, to sabotage Wisconsin's attempt to do what he will not do, which is deal with the insolvency of their government. In doing so, he has set the stage for 2012 by saying the Democratic Party is the party of government, not just in having an exaggerated view of the scope and competence of government, but because its base is in public employees.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, Donna, mobilizing his troops, sabotaging the effort to cut the budget, he did use the word \"assault,\" the president. Is that too much? I mean, what is going on here? Because it's happening in your state, as well.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, they're entering day seven of the protests. And my recollection is that President Obama commented on it in day four of the protest. So the fact is, is that this is a grassroots movement that had nothing to do with people or politicians in Washington, D.C. This has everything to do with the workers there in Wisconsin and all across the country who are feeling the effects of these draconian budget cuts.\n\nLook, state and local workers have taken the brunt of a lot of these cuts. And they're willing to come to the table to talk to the governor to put forward more wage cuts, more pension -- pay up more money for their pension, more for their health care. Why won't the government sit down with them? That's all they want. They want the governor to sit down with them, to talk about these items, but they want their collective bargaining right, their voice at the table removed from the discussion.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is this a defining moment for -- for the labor movement?\n\nBRAZILE: Absolutely. Look, union membership is at an all-time low over the previous 20-year high. This is an assault on workers across the country. And people believe that they're using the pretense of a budget battle to destroy collective bargaining rights.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, Representative Southerland, a freshman to this process, is this about fiscal responsibility? Or what is happening? Because it's happening in your state, as well.\n\nSOUTHERLAND: It is. And as you know, with nearly all of the states requiring a balanced budget amendment, they don't have any choice. The governors have to balance their budget. I know our own governor, Governor Scott, we see similar measures being taken in the state of Florida.\n\nAnd I think you're seeing this in New Jersey, you're seeing this in Wisconsin, so I think that, because they're bound by that limit of a balanced budget -- which I am in favor of at the federal level -- I think that you're going to see this around the country.\n\nYou -- look, the American family is learning they have to do more with less. And the same expectation, I think, is fair of the governments, both state and federal.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Jon, is it just about the budget? Or is Madison, Wisconsin, have a bigger political implication?\n\nKARL: Oh, it clearly has a bigger political implication. Look, the president was quicker and more forceful in his denouncement of Governor Scott Walker than he was of in denouncing Hosni Mubarak. I mean, this happened, it was more forceful, it was quicker.\n\nMadison, Wisconsin, the state of Wisconsin, this is arguably ground zero for the 2012 presidential campaign. Look, this is a state that if President Obama loses, he almost certainly is going to not win re-election. This is a state that's been solidly Democratic and (inaudible) more in the direction of Republicans, a bigger move than any other state in 2010.\n\nI mean, look what happened. You saw the Republicans capture the governorship, capture the state legislature, two House seats, a Senate seat, and, you know, Democrats see the momentum and see real danger signs for next year.\n\nWILL: Governor Walker was elected promising to do what he's doing. He did the same thing as county executive in Milwaukee, where he was -- there were protests, union uprisings, and he was handily re-elected.\n\nDonna, as I'm sure you know, such heroes of the labor movement as Franklin Roosevelt and Fiorello La Guardia said there's no place in the public sector for unionization at all. As I'm sure you know, 24 states limit or deny entirely collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions. And all Mr. Scott is planning to do is limit collective bargaining to wages. What is draconian about that?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, what these workers would like, George, since they've already given up furloughs, paid leave, unpaid leave, what they would like is -- is to have a voice at the table. They don't want their collective bargaining rights.\n\nAnd, look, what we're talking about is that the governor has cherry-picked what public workers he will subject to this so-called removal of their collective bargaining rights. The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid, well, guess what? They don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights.\n\nChristiane, over 400,000 state and local employees have lost their jobs over -- during the -- the duration of the recession. They are willing -- what we've seen across the country is, these workers are willing to come to the table to talk to these governors about reducing the -- the budget deficit, but not on the backs of working people.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. We're going to continue this after a break. Tea Party revolutionaries on Capitol Hill, Washington braces for a possible government shutdown. The big question: Which side will blink first?",

    "text":"In the fifth part of the second Democratic primary debate, the candidates delved into personal topics such as the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal, and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives.\n\nDuring the debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received laughter and applause for defending his progressive tax policy. When asked how he would fund proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders responded that he would finance them by making the wealthiest people and largest corporations pay their fair share, as they have benefited disproportionately for years.\n\nWhen CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed Sanders for specifics, asking how high he would go with taxes, Sanders replied that they had not determined an exact number yet, but it would be lower than the 90 percent tax rate under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nSanders emphasized that his administration would address the absurdity of billionaires paying a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. He believes in real tax reform where the wealthiest individuals and corporations contribute their fair share.\n\nDuring Eisenhower's first term as president, the highest marginal tax rate on regular income for individuals earning over $400,000 was 92 percent. This rate was carried over from President Harry Truman's administration, and it constituted the second-highest tax rate in the 20th century. In 1954, the highest bracket rate was reduced to 91 percent.\n\nBased on these historical tax rates, Sanders' claim that he is not as \"socialist\" as Eisenhower is accurate. Although he hasn't provided an exact number, Sanders has previously stated that he doesn't believe his tax policy would exceed a 90 percent top bracket rate.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"CBS This Morning\" in September, Sanders explained his plan to ask the wealthiest individuals and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. When asked about specific rates for the highest income bracket, he stated that he doesn't think it needs to reach 90 percent.\n\nHowever, Sanders has advocated for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's presidency.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended taxing the wealthy at a higher rate during the debate. He pointed out that in Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal tax rate was 70 percent, further supporting the idea of asking the wealthy to contribute more.\n\nOverall, Sanders' statement about not being as socialist as Eisenhower is supported by historical tax rates, although he has yet to provide an exact tax rate for the highest income bracket.",

    "description":"Dueling October surprises.",
    "text":"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post\u2019s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta\u2019s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump from the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump\u2019s language and attitudes toward women. His advisors worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisors urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump\u2019s Sunday night debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans\u2019 freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. \u201cThese words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,\u201d Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies\u2019 advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. \u201cDonald Trump needs to humble himself,\u201d Trump advisor Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States utter some of Trump\u2019s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. \u201cThere have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: \u201cHow does any woman work for Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America\u2019s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department\u2019s release of more of Clinton\u2019s own emails from her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump\u2019s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s candidacy appeared\u2014yet again\u2014to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta\u2019s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton\u2019s emails, which he called an \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump\u2019s words, however. \u201cWomen have the power to stop Trump,\u201d Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events\u2014and the responses\u2014would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cHe is talking about sexual assault. There\u2019s no other way to frame this,\u201d Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide\u2019s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches\u2014a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton\u2019s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa\u2019s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? \u201cClinton admits she is out of touch,\u201d \u201cClinton suggests she is a moderate\u201d and \u201cClinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.\u201d\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: \u201cClinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.\u201d Republicans are obsessed with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump\u2019s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump\u2019s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call \u201clocker-room banter\u201d laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women\u2019s appearance in crass terms, and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that \u201csuch vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\u2019s face to the world.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois called Trump \u201ca malignant clown.\u201d Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks \u201ctotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said \u201cAmerica deserves far better\u201d than Trump. Trump\u2019s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination, Jeb Bush, said \u201cno apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women.\u201d\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump\u2019s video. \u201cThey did their opposition research. This is what they had,\u201d former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. \u201cShe has to change the narrative.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump\u2019s supporters firmly in their camp. \u201cA 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump\u2019s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman\u2019s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there\u2019s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night\u2019s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.",

I'm Christiane Amanpour.\n\nAnd at the top of the news this week: nuclear secret, a report of a major advance in North Korea's nuclear program. What new threat does it pose? And how will it impact the president's disarmament agenda and his push to get the Senate to ratify his START nuclear treaty?\n\nOBAMA: This is not about politics. It's about national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: This morning, the nation's top military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. Plus, the escalating war in Afghanistan. His views on night raids, relations with President Karzai, and deadlines for U.S. withdrawal.\n\nThen, hot zone. As Haiti reels from a cholera outbreak, we ask, what happened to the global pledge to rebuild the nation?\n\nAnd G.M.'s new start. Was the bailout good for America after all? Analysis on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\n\nPlus, the Sunday funnies.\n\nLETTERMAN: The Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrives this week. And as soon as it gets to Washington, it will die in committee. Did you know that?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.\n\nAMANPOUR: Hello again. And with reports of a new nuclear facility in North Korea and a new deadline in the Afghanistan war, there's a lot to discuss with our guest, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nPresident Obama returned late last night from the NATO summit in Lisbon where the United States and its allies are now talking about another deadline, the end of 2014 to hand over combat operations to Afghan forces. To make that happen, American and NATO forces are escalating the war right now, and so we start with a powerful report from ABC's Mike Boettcher in Afghanistan.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBOETTCHER (voice-over): When Lieutenant Colonel Steve Lutsky last saw 10-year-old Sadekela (ph), he was bleeding to death on the side of a road.\n\nLUTSKY: His mom was yelling out that, \"My son is dead. My son is dead.\"\n\nBOETTCHER: Now he is recovering at a U.S. military hospital. The lives of the American officer and the Afghan boy intersected on this stretch of highway in Khost province, when a car bomber trying to kill Lutsky and his men attacked their column.\n\n(on-screen): The American convoy was traveling this direction. The other way, civilian vehicles. They slowed down when the convoy passed. So did a suicide bomber. And inside his car, he had 600 pounds of high explosives.\n\n(voice-over): The soldiers were not hurt, but the explosion killed one child and injured three others, including Sadekela (ph). Now angry at the Taliban, Sadekela's (ph) family is grateful to the Americans for saving his life, a small but important victory in a war where not killing civilians is more important than killing the enemy.\n\nTOWNSEND: It buys us credit, in the sense that there's a little more respect for us and there's a little more trust for us.\n\nBOETTCHER: America's top officers tell Afghans that it's the Taliban who are killing civilians, a message undermined by President Karzai's claims that U.S. special operations night raids are killing innocent people.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Nine out of 10 civilian casualties are caused by the Taliban.\n\nBOETTCHER: At a district center in eastern Afghanistan, not everyone is convinced by that argument. During a visit by the 101st Airborne's deputy commander in Afghanistan, Steve Townsend (ph), a village elder asserted that the Americans were killing more Afghans than the Soviets did a quarter century ago. Townsend pushed back hard.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Look in my eyes right now. You know I'm telling the truth.\n\nBOETTCHER: But as the words fly, so do bombs and bullets. Combat Outpost Firra (ph), situated on the Pakistan border, is often attacked. During one assault, 18 insurgents died, but soldiers know this: You can't kill your way out of Afghanistan.\n\n(UNKNOWN): They can reconstitute faster than we can. We're so close to Pakistan that they just come right across the border.\n\nBOETTCHER: So rather than enemy body counts, real success here is measured in how quickly Afghan feet can fill American-made boots. If the war is to end, Afghan soldiers will have to end it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We have to make a difference. Coming here and -- and just running around and killing the enemy and then leaving and looking back and saying, \"I didn't make a difference, I didn't make a change,\" will cause us to never leave.\n\nBOETTCHER: Steve Lutsky's son is the same age as young Sadekela (ph), 10. The colonel wants only one thing to come from his service here: confidence that his own son someday will not be fighting his father's war.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Mike Boettcher, ABC News, Forward Operating Base Clark, Afghanistan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: And joining me now is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nWelcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nMULLEN: Good morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we will discuss, of course, Afghanistan, but let me get to the breaking news this morning, the report by the New York Times of the discovery of a new nuclear facility in North Korea. How much of a threat is that to the United States, to the world?\n\nMULLEN: Well, this validates a long-standing concern that we've had with respect to North Korea and -- and its enrichment of uranium. It also continues to validate a country that is led by a dictator who is constantly -- who constantly desires to destabilize the region. And he's done that again, certainly, with this capability, as well.\n\nAnd certainly the development of nuclear weapons is a huge concern for all of us, those in the region, as well as those around the globe.\n\nAMANPOUR: How could this have happened in secret, despite the sanctions that were put on? Practically as the sanctions were put on, this was being built.\n\nMULLEN: Well, he's defied sanctions. There are two, actually, U.N. Security Council sanctions that he's defied in this. He's defied what he said he'd do in 2005, because he said he clearly would comply and not -- not do the -- generate this kind of capability, and yet he does.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. But what options, then, do you have? If sanctions are the toughest measure and he's doing it, what's your answer to that?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think we have to continue to bring pressure on him specifically. Those in the region -- in particular the six-party talk countries, Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, we all -- we have to continue to do that.\n\nHe is predictable in his unpredictability, if you will, because not too long ago, he killed 46 South Korean sailors. He has over time continued to destabilize this region. And, in fact, I also believe that this has to do with a succession plan for his son.\n\nAMANPOUR: But do you think they're planning to make more nuclear weapons? What do you think they're trying to do? And again, if sanctions aren't working, what will?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think we have to continue to bring pressure on him specifically. Those in the region -- in particular the six-party talk countries, Russia, China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, we all -- we have to continue to do that.\n\nHe is predictable in his unpredictability, if you will, because not too long ago, he killed 46 South Korean sailors. He has over time continued to destabilize this region. And, in fact, I also believe that this has to do with a succession plan for his son.\n\nAMANPOUR: But do you think they're planning to make more nuclear weapons? What do you think they're trying to do? And again, if sanctions aren't working, what will?\n\nMULLEN: Well, the assumption certainly is, is that they continue to head in the direction of additional nuclear weapons. And they're also -- they also are known to proliferate this technology.\n\nSo they're a very dangerous country. And -- and he has been someone who has not responded thus far to previous actions. He actually blows hot and cold. He moves in a direction for a while, and then he reverts, and I certainly would see him in his reversion mode at this particular point in time.\n\nAMANPOUR: And why didn't U.S. intelligence discover this?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I won't go into any...\n\nAMANPOUR: But isn't that alarming?\n\nMULLEN: I won't go into any specific intelligence kinds of things today, Christiane, but I would say that, you know, this is something we've been concerned about for a significant period of time, and also penetration of -- of the North Koreans, in terms of intelligence capabilities, is very, very difficult.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think China is the one to help you resolve this?\n\nMULLEN: I think China has...\n\nAMANPOUR: Will it?\n\nMULLEN: ... an awful lot to do with that. We've been engaged with China for an extended period of time with respect to North Korea. The president sent out a team to each of the capitals this weekend to re-engage, and so that's where we are right now, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. And a great part of this, I think, will have to be done through Beijing.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you worried about North Korea making more nuclear weapons right now with this facility? Is that what it's showing?\n\nMULLEN: I've been worried about North Korea and its potential nuclear capability for a long time. This certainly gives that potential real life, very visible life that we all ought to be very, very focused on.\n\nAMANPOUR: The president and the president of Russia have signed the New START treaty. This week, that has been sort of stopped, stopping START in the Senate by the number-two Republican senator there, Jon Kyl.\n\nCan I ask you -- I'm basically going to wave around a veritable \"who's who\" of Republican and Democratic former secretaries of state, of defense, all sorts of people who have been studying this for a long time and say that this has to be ratified. Does it have to be ratified? Is this necessary for U.S. national -- national security?\n\nMULLEN: I think this is -- more than anything else, it's a national security issue. I was involved extensively in the negotiations with my counterpart in Russia. We have for decades have had treaties with them to -- to be able to -- to verify aspects of the nuclear weapons capabilities that we both have. And from a national security perspective, this is absolutely critical.\n\nAMANPOUR: So when it comes to the military impact of this treaty, are you convinced that all the military issues have been dealt with and the United States would be no weaker or a in no worse place if this was ratified?\n\nMULLEN: Completely comfortable with where we are militarily, myself, the rest of the uniformed leadership, as well as the secretary of defense.\n\nAMANPOUR: And the intelligence agencies have signed off on all the verification procedures and measures? You're comfortable with that?\n\nMULLEN: Absolutely. The verification regime that exists in this is in ways better than the one that has existed in the past. Some criticize that there are fewer inspections; the arsenal is much smaller than it used to be. We are close to one year without any ability to verify what's going on in Russia.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you're comfortable with the amount of money that the president and the administration has pledged to modernize American nuclear arsenals?\n\nMULLEN: I have. I reviewed it -- I've reviewed it several times. And it is a very clear commitment to modernize the nuclear infrastructure in this country.\n\nAMANPOUR: So by a process of elimination, is the Senate playing politics with American national security?\n\nMULLEN: Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that.\n\nAMANPOUR: What do you think?\n\nMULLEN: Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be both recognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a national security issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done, the better.\n\nAMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: As soon as possible.\n\nAMANPOUR: In a lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: Certainly, the potential is there for a lame-duck, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you would want that?\n\nMULLEN: I would -- that's the soonest possible time, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: And just so we're clear, why does one need Russia's cooperation today?\n\nMULLEN: I've worked hard, not just in this treaty, with my counterpart in Russia, and I've seen it up and down our government over the course of the last couple of years, and we've really taken significant steps, no better example than this weekend, where President Medvedev was actually in Lisbon with all of NATO supportive of a missile defense treaty -- I'm sorry, missile defense capability in the future. And a year or two ago, that just not would have been possible.\n\nThe Russians have supported us in Afghanistan, allowed us to transport some of our most significant equipment, where they could have pushed back on that.\n\nThey've also helped in other ways that wouldn't be widely known. So the relationship is maturing, very specifically, and it's one that's helped us in Iran. So they've -- so -- so there's been an awful lot tied into the improvement of this relationship.\n\nAMANPOUR: Not ratifying it, does that harm American credibility? For instance, many of the senators who are saying, no, let's not do it in this lame-duck session are the very ones who say we need to make sure that Iran doesn't proliferate nuclear material, we need to make sure, as we've just seen, that North Korea does not. How does this affect America's credibility when it comes to nonproliferation?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think President Obama said coming out of this NATO summit many of the leaders there spoke to him about the need to ratify this New START treaty, and certainly it's indicative of the commitment that many other countries have to us and the importance of getting it done.\n\nSo I'm certainly concerned about how -- and in particular, how we look and also this -- this emerging relationship with Russia and what it would mean to not do that. And they've clearly sent signals already with respect to that which haven't been positive.\n\nAMANPOUR: What signals?\n\nMULLEN: Just -- they've spoken to the need to get this done, the importance of it, and whether or not it would be tied to this relationship, given all that we've done in the course of the last couple of years.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's move on to Afghanistan, an area where you said that they have been cooperating. They've just said that they're going to offer more roots through their -- through their territory for material for NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nIn NATO, summit in Lisbon, talking now about a 2014 deadline for transferring combat responsibilities to the Afghan forces. I've also heard -- is that an absolute date?\n\nMULLEN: Yes, it is.\n\nAMANPOUR: Absolute?\n\nMULLEN: Yes, it is. It's one everybody signed up to.\n\nAMANPOUR: All combat operations will be handed over to Afghans at the end of 2014?\n\nMULLEN: I would describe it much like what we just went through in Iraq, where clearly they have the lead for their own security. We are then in some capacity, in a training, advising, and assist mode, which we would expect to be for some time, but in terms of combat operations, they would have the lead.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you see post-2014 just like we see in Iraq today?\n\nMULLEN: As best we can tell, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: Any more?\n\nMULLEN: Any more...\n\nAMANPOUR: ... troops, operations. I mean, I ask you, because right now, how many areas have even been transferred to Afghan control?\n\nMULLEN: Well, one of the things that happened -- one of the things that happened in Lisbon was the commitment to start to -- that transfer in the spring, and that will be based on conditions on the ground and a recommendation from General Petraeus, literally district by district. So it's a significant commitment to start that this spring.\n\nAgain, it really is a situation where -- where the Afghans then lead, specifically in terms of their own security, and we think that's absolutely critical, and that they'll be capable of starting to be able to do that this spring.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, your own officers say, in fact, even in the least combative areas of Afghanistan, that it could take something like 18 months to 24 months to complete a transfer to Afghan lead, in terms of security. Can they really, do you believe, take over security within four years?\n\nMULLEN: I do believe, as best we understand things right now, that that's very much a reachable goal. There's a lot to do between now and then, clearly. Very dangerous place, very tough fight we're in right now. We certainly understand that.\n\nBut that's a goal actually that President Karzai set out there and that all NATO allies -- actually, all countries who are providing forces -- because there are some 20 other countries doing that -- have signed up to, and we think it's reachable.\n\nAMANPOUR: In order to do that, it looks like the situation on the ground is shifting. In other words, that there is a huge spike in raids, whether it be drones on the Pakistan area, whether it be trying to kill as many Taliban as possible on the ground in Afghanistan. Is that what's happening now?\n\nMULLEN: We knew this year would be a particularly difficult year because of all the added troops that we put in, among other things. And it has been. And I would expect next year to be a very difficult year, as well.\n\nThat said, the -- the security situation has started to change. It has started to get better -- better. We've sacrificed greatly, tragic losses, far too many always, but we've also succeeded in starting to reverse the momentum. I think General Petraeus calls it we've arrested the momentum in some specific places...\n\nAMANPOUR: But he said it's not irreversible.\n\nMULLEN: No, it isn't irreversible, and it's still fragile. That's really where we are right now in this fight.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, given that fact, as you put it, what is the relationship with President Karzai, which seems to be basically all over the place on any given day? What does he say now about night raids?\n\nMULLEN: Well, he's -- I think, obviously, most recently, he's spoken to his concerns about that. The piece that you ran earlier speaks to a huge issue, which is the issue of civilian casualties, but it also speaks to a point that was -- is oftentimes not clearly articulated, which is the Taliban are killing about 9 or 10 times more civilians than -- than our forces are. And we are making extraordinary efforts to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nWe recognize President Karzai's concern with respect to night raids and some of the other concerns that he has, and we are doing all we can. There has to be a balance here, very specifically.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me move quickly over to Yemen. Al Qaida brazenly puts out a statement today, yesterday saying that this is our tactic, bombs that cost $4,000-plus, a raid against all your multibillions of security in counterterrorism. Are they going to succeed with one of these cargo plane bombs?\n\nMULLEN: Well, there's an awful lot of effort going on to make sure that they don't. And...\n\nAMANPOUR: Doesn't that worry you?\n\nMULLEN: You bet it worries me. And I give credit to a lot of people to -- at this point in time that -- that they haven't been able to pull something like this off, because it's a very serious threat, and I believe what they are saying. They've grown, it's dangerous, and it's a place we need to focus.\n\nAMANPOUR: \"Don't ask\/don't tell,\" something that's hugely important right now. A draft report has come to you; some 70 percent of the military say that it will either have a beneficial or nonexistent effect. Do you think it needs to be voted on in this lame-duck session?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I won't speak to what the draft report says. We'll have this report done here...\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think...\n\nMULLEN: ... and to Secretary Gates in the next couple of weeks, by December 1st, and I won't make any comments on where I think we need to go until that report is done.\n\nAMANPOUR: You support it, though, repealing \"don't ask\/don't tell\"?\n\nMULLEN: From my personal perspective, absolutely.\n\nAMANPOUR: Because?\n\nMULLEN: Because I think it -- it belies us as an institution. We value integrity as an institution.\n\nAMANPOUR: You mean forcing them to lie about what they are?\n\nMULLEN: And then -- and then asking individuals to come in and lie about who they are every day goes counter to who we are as an institution.\n\nAMANPOUR: Apart from the integrity issue, many of your allies -- whether it be England or Canada or France or Australia, the Israeli army -- they have openly gay servicemembers in their military with no adverse effects.\n\nMULLEN: Certainly. I've seen that, and that is very much a part of this review, and we'll incorporate that into the review and recommendations which go up the chain.\n\nAMANPOUR: So were you angry with the new Marine commandant when he cast his own doubts over this and criticized it?\n\nMULLEN: He had made his position very clear in testimony. What concerned me about his most recent comments, it came at a time where we actually had the draft report in hand, and we had all agreed that we would speak to this privately until we completed the report and made our recommendations up the chain.\n\nAMANPOUR: And if it does not get voted on in the lame-duck session, is there any chance that it will come up in any reasonable time period afterwards?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I mean, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen. Obviously, from a legislative...\n\nAMANPOUR: But would you think it will put it down the road?\n\nMULLEN: ... from a legislative perspective. The other piece that is out there that's very real is the courts are very active on this. And my concern is that at some point in time the courts could change this law and in that not give us the right amount of time to implement it. I think it's much better done -- if it's going to get done, it's much better done through legislature than it is out of the courts.\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen, thank you very much indeed for joining us.\n\nMULLEN: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: And the roundtable is next, with George Will, Robert Reich, Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce from the Financial Times.\n\nAnd also, later, a report from Haiti on the cholera outbreak. Has the country been abandoned again?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n(UNKNOWN): Whoa.\n(UNKNOWN): Yes. Pull. Dang it.\n(UNKNOWN): Missed it.\n(UNKNOWN): Bristol the Pistol, you fired a few blanks during the week, but tonight all guns blazing.\n\nWALTERS: If you ran for president, could you beat Barack Obama?\nPALIN: I believe so.\nBIDEN: She's always underestimated, so, you know, I think -- I think I shouldn't say any more.\n(UNKNOWN): There you go.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: A big week for Sarah Palin, one of the topics for our roundtable with George Will, Robert Reich, author of \"Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future,\" Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times.\n\nAnd I want to start with our interview with Mike Mullen. We're clearly going to get to Sarah Palin. What do you think? Admiral Mullen could barely be constrained from saying that he thought this was political, this holdup.\n\nREICH: I thought it was very interesting, Christiane. I mean, when you asked him that question, he was very, very tempted -- you could almost read his mind -- to say that, look, Jon Kyl is taking direction from Mitch McConnell, who says explicitly that the next two years are going to be about making sure that Barack Obama is not a two-term president. And, therefore, this is all politics, and therefore, the Republicans are putting politics above national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, on an issue like this, they can't do that, can they? I mean, really, he ticked off the military, the intelligence, the financial; all the questions that they had have been resolved.\n\nWILL: I take Jon Kyl at his word, and I respect him very much. I think what he says is, first of all, it's nonsense to say, as Joe Biden, the gift who keeps on giving does say, that it is -- the vital national security interest of the United States is to ratify this in a lame-duck session? That means that if we didn't have a lame-duck session, which we shouldn't do ever, the nation would be...\n\nAMANPOUR: But the vital interest is to ratify it right now, as soon as possible.\n\nWILL: As opposed to six weeks from now? Oh, please.\n\nAMANPOUR: But it -- but it looks like it would be put off, even if it was -- they want more debate. They want to reopen it, talk about it again.\n\nWILL: Jon Kyl is bargaining for the modernization of our nuclear force.\n\nAMANPOUR: So it's about money?\n\nWILL: Can I give you -- that's part -- it's about the modernization of our force. Can I give you Will's law of arms control? Arm's control is impossible until it's unimportant. This is unimportant, so it's going to get done. That is, who lies awake at night worrying about the size, not the security, but the size of the Russian nuclear arsenal? No one.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you're partly right there, because the size is not the main issue. It's the verification, which is a huge issue, and, vitally, American credibility. Here we have this story from North Korea today -- how does America stand up and say, \"You guys can't proliferate,\" if we're not going to do this? How can we lead?\n\nLUCE: Very, very difficult. I mean, Russia, of course, is a part of the six-party group with North Korea, and therefore its cooperation is also important there, as it is on Afghanistan, as it is on Iran.\n\nThese broader implications for failing to ratify START here go across the world. Russia's cooperation is something that Obama has worked on very successfully, very patiently, along with Hillary Clinton, for two years now, and this puts it in jeopardy.\n\nJust one other point, though, about Mitch McConnell's pledge to make Obama a one-term president. Clearly, that's going to be the strategy of the Republicans. Question is, are they going to do it intelligently or unintelligently? And I think Senator Kyl, his comments and his stance, indicate it could well be the latter.\n\nBRAZILE: Senator Kyl a year ago, after returning from Geneva, called upon the Senate to quickly ratify this treaty. Now, what has happened in one year? What has happened, clearly, is that the Republicans have redoubled their efforts to block anything that President Obama would like to see passed. They want to deny him a victory.\n\nThis is political malpractice. And Senator Kyl said that himself. So it might be -- George is probably correct. This might be about money, to get more money for the nuclear industry complex. The president has promised $4 billion more, but in all...\n\nAMANPOUR: In addition to $80 billion.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right. But in all of the hearings this year and all of the conversations, Senator Kyl, no one else, you know, expressed any objections, and now this is, I think, one of those political moments where they can succeed in blocking the president.\n\nREICH: You know, there were 21 separate hearings and briefings. I mean, this is not something that is being put suddenly on the agenda. And for Kyl to say right now we just don't have time or this is -- there's not enough money I think defies logic.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, again, as Admiral Mullen said, it's not just a nice treaty with a foreign country. It is about Russia's cooperation on all the issues that the United States needs, whether it's Afghanistan, Iran, and all the rest of it.\n\nPlus, I don't know what you think, but some are saying that this could give rise to the hard-liners in Russia again, who just do not want to -- who just don't want to deal with the United States.\n\nLUCE: Oh, absolutely. I think it's -- it's a dream -- if you picked two countries that would like to see a failure of ratification, it would be North Korea and Iran. And I think that -- if that argument doesn't work with the Republicans, that sort of basic elemental national security argument doesn't work, nothing is. There's -- there's a greater hatred of Obama than there is a love of American national security.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's switch right back to here and economic security. G.M. today this week had success, initial public offering. The bailout worked? The saving G.M. worked?\n\nREICH: Well, it worked, Christiane, to the extent that, indeed, G.M. is now worth $50 billion, if you believe the stock market, and before, in the old G.M., was worth $25 billion.\n\nBut what happened during the bailout? Actually, it was a -- it -- it was not so much a bailout as it was a reorganization under bankruptcy, and they got rid of $80 billion of debt, they got rid of thousands of jobs, divisions that were not functioning. Wall Streeters came in and reorganized G.M.\n\nWhy do we suppose the exact same thing would not have happened under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganization? It's not clear that the $50 billion of taxpayer money was necessary.\n\nWILL: Of course, we'll get it back, unless their share price goes to $55 and they sell 500 million shares of the stock.\n\nDon't believe a word G.M. says. Remember that last April their CEO, in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, and then echoing in television commercials, said G.M. has paid back the bailout in full. It paid back a tiny sliver of it, and it paid it back with government funds from another account. So do not listen to G.M.\n\nAMANPOUR: Don't listen to a word G.M. says?\n\nLUCE: I -- I find that difficult to disagree with. I would, however, say just in defense of the Treasury's handling of this IPO that there is not an IPO in the world that -- not a privatization in the world that isn't controversial, that hasn't been criticized for being underpriced or overpriced or misallocated. And in this case, clearly, they're going to have to see an increase in the share price to get the taxpayer money fully back.\n\nBRAZILE: We saved a critical part of the American manufacturing base, and that's -- that's good news during this Thanksgiving week.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, indeed, Warren Buffett, who knows a bit about business, has written an op-ed this last week to -- \"To Uncle Sam, thank you from your grateful nephew, Warren, for actually saving the economy.\" Do you give the administration any credit for that?\n\nREICH: Yes, certainly. And the economy would be much worse were it not for everything the administration has done. But, again, it's hard to prove a negative. It's very, very difficult right now.\n\nWe look at the degree of anger and upset still there in the American economy, on Main Street. The Washington Post ran a survey not long ago showing that 53 percent of homeowners -- 53 percent -- are worried about paying their mortgage.\n\nNow, this may be a good economy for Wall Street, it may be a good economy for the IPOs, it may be a good economy for the people in the top 1 percent whose assets are in financial instruments, but this is not a good economy yet for most people.\n\nAMANPOUR: The economy is showing still slow signs of coming back. The job numbers keep getting incrementally better, but not enough to affect the 9.6 percent. Was it -- is it -- is it actually going to help?\n\nLUCE: The G.M. IPO? Well, I mean, I think...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, and the -- and the -- the measures, as Warren Buffett said, that helped keep the economy from diving.\n\nLUCE: Yes, but they're all in the system. They're out there. Nothing more other than what Ben Bernanke and the Fed is doing is going to be available in this political climate. And whether that will be enough to help, I think there are grounds for deep skepticism. I do think we're looking at a Japan-style situation here of low growth or at least the threat of that.\n\nOne thing I'd say about the G.M. IPO, just to back up Donna, is the counterfactual here. If G.M. had been -- had gone bankrupt and large portions of it had been closed down, we could have lost several hundred thousand jobs. The exaggerated number of 1 million might be too high.\n\nThe administration's communications effort on this has been absolutely abysmal. It's quite extraordinary to me how they haven't put this forward more forcefully and -- and how the public still doesn't see just how different a kind of bailout this was than the Wall Street bailouts, which remain deservedly unpopular.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me just play what Warren Buffett told us about taxes. Obviously, this is going to come up in this session of Congress, the Bush-era taxes, which either have to be extended or not. This is what he said .

    "text":"gton, D.C.\n\n12:03 P.M. EDT\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Good afternoon from Washington, D.C. I'm John Harwood. It is noon on the East Coast. The Dow Jones average stands around 10,700 points; 15 million Americans are out of work. And we're spending the next hour talking about how to fix the troubled American economy.\n\nPlease welcome the President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, thanks for being here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That was quite a lead-in, by the way. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Yes, wasn\u2019t it? You like that dramatic pause? (Laughter.) We have got a cross-section of people from around the country -- CEOs, union workers, teachers and students --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a good-looking group, I have to say. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: -- small business owners, people who don't have a job. Every one of them has a stake in the American Dream. And they got some good news over the weekend. The National Bureau of Economic Research, as you know, has said that the recession ended in June 2009 -- a few months after you took office. And yet here\u2019s the problem you find yourself with. Many leaders in business think you and your policies are hostile to them. And many ordinary Americans think your policies are helping Wall Street and big business. How did that happen?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, even though economists may say that the recession officially ended last year, obviously for the millions of people who are still out of work, people who have seen their home values decline, people who are struggling to pay the bills day to day, it\u2019s still very real for them.\n\nAnd I think we have to go back to what was happening when I was first sworn in as the 44th President of the United States. We went through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Nothing has come close. In fact, if you look at the consequences of the recession in the \u201880s, the recession in the \u201890s, and the recession in 2001, and you combine all three of those, it still wasn\u2019t as bad as this recession that we went through.\n\nSo the month I was sworn in we lost 750,000 jobs; the month after that 600,000; the month after that 600,000. This is before any of our plans had a chance to take effect. The financial markets were on the verge of meltdown and the economy was contracting about 6 percent -- by far, the largest contraction we've seen since the \u201830s.\n\nYou combine all that and what that meant was that we had to take some steps very quickly just to make sure that the financial system was not collapsing -- that people could get auto loans, could get student loans, that businesses large and small could get some financing to keep their doors open and to keep their payrolls on track. And in addition, we had to make sure that we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression.\n\nNow, we've done that. Those programs that we put in place worked. So now you\u2019ve got a financial system that is stable. It\u2019s still not as strong as it was back in 2006, 2007, but it is stabilized. You\u2019ve got now eight consecutive months of private sector job growth. Businesses are able to borrow again; they\u2019re investing again; they\u2019re making profits again.\n\nThat's all the good news. The challenge is, is that the hole was so deep that a lot of people out there are still hurting -- and probably some folks here in the audience are still having a tough time. (Applause.) And so the question then becomes what can we now put in place to make sure that the trend lines continue in a positive direction, as opposed to going back in the negative direction.\n\nLast week we got some good news. After fighting for several months, we finally got a small business tax cut bill in place so that we\u2019re eliminating capital gains for small businesses and startups, making sure that they can get loans -- because small businesses are the ones that have been hardest hit in terms of not being able to get capital. We have put forward proposals, for example, to accelerate investment here in the United States instead of overseas in research and development and plants and equipment that could put people back to work.\n\nSo there are a lot of plans in place that can make improvement, but it\u2019s slow and steady, as opposed to the kind of quick fix that I think a lot of people would like to see. But the thing I\u2019ve just got to remind people of is the fact that it took us a decade to get into the problem that we\u2019re in right now.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal came out with a report based on Census information that the years from 2001 to 2009, the middle class actually saw their wages decline by 5 percent. This was before the financial crisis. So these have been some long-term trends of the middle class having a lot of problems out there. And what we\u2019ve got to do now it to reverse it, but something that took 10 years to create is going to take a little more time to solve.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: I\u2019ve heard you give that turnaround message you just gave many times.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right, right.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let me ask about your assessment of the challenge and the problem in communicating that to the American people. We all identify with people like ourselves. Do you think it\u2019s possible that because of your style, or the unusual things about your background -- your racial heritage, where you grew up, Ivy League education -- that the fearful voters who are about to go to the polls in November think, yes, I hear him, he may get it intellectually, but he doesn\u2019t feel what I\u2019m feeling?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here\u2019s my suspicion. I think that when the unemployment rate is still high and people are having a tough time, it doesn\u2019t matter if I was green -- (laughter) -- it doesn\u2019t matter if I was purple. I think people would still be frustrated, and understandably so.\n\nLook, I can describe what\u2019s happening to the economy overall, but if you\u2019re out of work right now, the only thing that you\u2019re going to be hearing is, when do I get a job? (Applause.) If you\u2019re about to lose your home, all you\u2019re thinking about is, when can I get my home?\n\nSo I don\u2019t think that those are the issues. And by the way, I think most people understand -- because I spent two years running around the country talking about my life and why I was running for President -- they understand that I was the kid of a single mom, and I got my education through scholarships, and I lived in a small apartment with my grandparents, and they were helped by the G.I. Bill and FHA in terms of being able to climb into the middle class.\n\nThe whole reason I ran was because my life is a testimony to the American Dream. And everything that we\u2019ve been doing since I came into office is designed to make sure that that American Dream continues for future generations.\n\nI think the challenge right now is that I\u2019m thinking about the next generation and there are a lot of folks out there who are thinking about the next election. If I were making decisions based on November, then I wouldn\u2019t have done some of the things that I did because I knew they weren\u2019t popular. But they were the right thing to do. And that's got to be my top priority. (Applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let\u2019s go to the real jury who will decide whether they were the right things to do with an audience question right here.\n\nQ Thank you very much and, quite frankly, good afternoon, President Obama. I am deeply honored to finally be in this forum, and so grateful  for CNBC making the forum available so that you can speak to American citizens just like myself.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you.\n\nQ I am a chief financial officer for a veterans service organization, AmVets here in Washington. I\u2019m also a mother, I\u2019m a wife, I\u2019m an American veteran, and I\u2019m one of your middle-class Americans. And quite frankly, I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nQ -- and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.\n\nI have been told that I voted for a man who said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class. I\u2019m one of those people, and I\u2019m waiting, sir. I\u2019m waiting. I don't feel it yet. And I thought, while it wouldn\u2019t be in great measure, I would feel it in some small measure.\n\nI have two children in private school. And the financial recession has taken an enormous toll on my family. My husband and I joked for years that we thought we were well beyond the hot dogs and beans era of our lives.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\nQ But quite frankly, it\u2019s starting to knock on our door and ring true that that might be where we\u2019re headed again. And quite frankly, Mr. President, I need you to answer this honestly, is this my new reality?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think that you describe exactly what is the bedrock of America -- a veteran who\u2019s working for veterans, somebody who is a CFO and I am sure knows how to manage their money, have made good decisions.\n\nQ Sometimes. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not saying once in a while you don't want to get a new pair of shoes. (Laughter.)\n\nQ Today. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So the life you describe -- one of responsibility, looking after your family, contributing back to your community -- that's what we want to reward.\n\nNow, as I said before, times are tough for everybody right now, so I understand your frustration. But I would just -- when you say there are things that you\u2019d like to see happen or you\u2019re hoping to see happen that haven\u2019t happened yet, let me just give you a couple of examples.\n\nI right now have two children -- it sounds like you\u2019ve got kids, as well.\n\nQ Two girls.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Two girls. You\u2019re going to be thinking about college soon.\n\nQ Next year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay. Now part of what we did over the last year and a half is to make sure that billions of dollars that were going to subsidize financial service industries under the federal student loan programs are now going to be going directly to students so that millions more students are going to be able to get loans and grants and scholarships to go to college. Now, that's going to have an impact on a whole bunch of kids out there, including maybe yours.\n\nIf you have a credit card, which I assume, you do --\n\nQ No.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, see, now you\u2019re really -- now you\u2019ve shown how responsible you are. (Laughter.) But if you have a mortgage or a credit card or any kind of financial dealings out there, as a consequence of the changes we made, the credit card companies can\u2019t increase your interest rate without notifying you, and they can\u2019t increase your interest rate on your previous balances. In terms of getting a mortgage, they -- you can\u2019t have a mortgage broker steer you to a mortgage that ultimately is going to cost you more money, because maybe they\u2019re getting a financial incentive to do so. Those things are now against the law. So there are a whole host of protections in there.\n\nYou are a parent who has children -- if your child, heaven forbid, had a preexisting condition, before I took office, you were out of luck in terms of being able to get health insurance for that child. Now, insurance companies have to give you health insurance for that child, and by the way, that health insurance can\u2019t drop you if you get sick.\n\nSo there are a whole host of things that we\u2019ve put in place that do make your life better. But the bottom line is if your 401(K) is still down substantially from where it was a while back, if you haven\u2019t seen a raise in a long time, if your home value went down --\n\nQ Keep going. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- depending on where you live, all those things still make you feel like, gosh, I\u2019m treading water.\n\nQ Still struggling -- that's right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And so my goal here is not to try to convince you that everything is where it needs to be. It\u2019s not. That's why I ran for President. But what I am saying is, is that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. And if we are able to keep our eye on our long-term goal -- which is making sure that every family out there, if they\u2019re middle class, that they can pay their bills, have the security of health insurance, retire with dignity and respect, send their kids to college; if they\u2019re not yet in the middle class, that there are ladders there to get into the middle class, if people work hard and get an education to apply themselves -- that's our goal. That's the America we believe in. And I think that we are on track to be able to do that.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me go at this from a different direction, from the direction of psychology, business confidence. You just mentioned things that credit card companies and health insurance companies used to do. There are some people in business who think, to use a phrase that you used recently about your critics, who think you talk about them like dogs. Let\u2019s listen to Ken Langone, a billionaire businessman.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, billionaire businessman?\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay.\n\n(Video is shown.)\n\nMR. LANGONE: What should they stop doing? Well, I think the one thing to do is to not make people in business feel like we\u2019re villains or criminals or doing something wrong. I think anytime we can create a job that puts somebody to work, the country is better served. So I think that there\u2019s got to be a need to understand that America, our democracy, is based on a strong, vibrant private economy.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Are you vilifying business?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, let\u2019s look at the track record here. When I came into office, businesses, some of the same commentators who are on CNBC, were crying, \u201cDo something,\u201d -- because as a consequence of reckless decisions that had been made, the economy was on the verge of collapse. Those same businesses now are profitable. The financial markets are stabilized. We haven\u2019t increased taxes on businesses. Actually, we have instituted about 50 tax cuts, many of them going to businesses large and small.\n\nAnd so the only thing that we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re not doing some of the same things that we were doing in the past that got us into this mess in the first place.\n\nSo when I mentioned, for example, changes in the financial services industry, it is very important for us not to find ourselves in a position in which banks get too big to fail, and if they make bad decisions taxpayers have to bail them out or we let the entire economy collapse. That\u2019s not a choice that I want any future President to have to make. And we instituted those changes.\n\nAnd the fact is that when FDR put in place deposit insurance in banks, banks said at the time, this is going to destroy capitalism. When Medicare was instituted, there were a whole bunch of people who said, this is socialized medicine. Now we take it for granted. But oftentimes there\u2019s this response that somehow these modest reforms that make the free market work better for consumers and for workers as well as for businesses, on the front end are resisted.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Let me take it, though, to a level that's beyond policy and it goes to what you value and you don't value.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Sure.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: I think some of those in business may think that deep down you think that working for profit is morally inferior to the kind of work you used to do as a community organizer. Is that how you feel?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, it isn\u2019t. Look, in every speech, every interview that I've made, I've constantly said that what sets America apart, what has made us successful over the long term, is we've got the most dynamic free market economy in the world. And that has to be preserved. That has to be preserved. We benefit from entrepreneurs and innovators who are going out there and creating jobs, creating businesses.\n\nGovernment can't create the majority of jobs. And in fact, we want to get out of the way of folks who\u2019ve got a great idea and want to run with it and are going to be putting people to work.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Maybe we've got one of those people right here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'd love to hear from him.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. I'm 30 years old. I recently graduated from law school. And I went back to law school in order to pursue a life of public service, like you have. And what I found was that I simply -- there aren't jobs out there right now. I took advantage of the loans that you were just speaking about, but I can't make the interest payments on those loans today, let alone think about getting a mortgage, having a family, having even a marriage -- it\u2019s awfully expensive. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to comment on that. (Laughter and applause.) Let me just say that whatever the expense, it\u2019s worth it. (Laughter.) I want that on record. (Applause.)\n\nQ Like a lot of people in my generation, I was really inspired by you and by your campaign and message that you brought, and that inspiration is dying away. It feels like the American Dream is not attainable to a lot of us. And what I'm really hoping to hear from you is several concrete steps that you\u2019re going to take moving forward that will be able to re-ignite my generation, re-ignite the youth who are beset by student loans. And I really want to know, is the American Dream dead for me?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, we still have the best universities in the world. We\u2019ve got the most dynamic private sector in the world. We\u2019ve got the most productive workers in the world. There is not a country in the world that would not want to change places with us. For all the problems that we\u2019ve got, as tough as things are right now, we are still the country that billions of people around the world look to and aspire to. And I want everybody to always remember that.\n\nNow, as I said before, what we saw happening during 2001 to the time I took office was wages actually declining for middle-class families, people treading water, young people having more trouble getting their foot in the door in terms of businesses. And so we are now having to go back to the fundamentals that made America great.\n\nAnd that means we\u2019ve got to improve our education system. That means that we have to make sure that our markets are working in a way that is good for a broad base of people and not just a narrow base of people. It means that, let\u2019s say -- you used the example of student loans -- one of the things that I just mentioned was, is that we put billions of dollars more into student loans. This was paid for, now. We took this out of financial service industries that were getting essentially unjustified subsidies -- they\u2019re now going to students so that your debt would be lower. And by the way, part of that law also capped your debt at 10 percent of your income so that you knew that you could actually afford to take out this debt and pay for it even if you had a modest salary.\n\n\n\nSo we are taking these steps. But the most important thing we can do right now is to grow our economy. That\u2019s the single most important thing that we can do. And some of the measures that we\u2019ve put forward and I\u2019m going to be fighting for are designed to exactly do that.\n\nFor example, we\u2019ve said let\u2019s accelerate business investment in the year 2011 to give a further jumpstart to the economy. That\u2019s something that, by the way, doesn't add to the deficit necessarily long term because this is depreciation that could be taken in the out-years. We\u2019re just saying you invest now, you can take it now. And that gives businesses incentives to do it.\n\nWe want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing in research and development here in the United States because the key to our long-term growth is technology and innovation. And if we can get more of those investments here, that's going to improve. The reforms we\u2019ve made on education -- which, by the way, have received bipartisan support -- are designed to make sure we\u2019ve got the best engineers and the best scientists in the world right here in the United States.\n\nSo if we\u2019re doing all those things, I am confident that the American Dream will continue for the next generation. What we can\u2019t do, though, is go back to the same old things that we were doing, because we\u2019ve been putting off these problems for decades. And that is something that I refuse to do.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me ask you a question about course correction. Sometimes a leader, even if you think you\u2019ve done the right things, but if the people you\u2019re trying to lead don't think so, you\u2019ve got to somehow accommodate that, just like you would in a relationship. He was talking about marriage. (Laughter.)\n\nAs you go forward, is there any way in which you want to signal to the American people that you\u2019re going to change your approach? And specifically -- we\u2019re coming up to the midterm election -- have you asked your Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and your top economic advisor Larry Summers to stay with you through the end of your term, or might you make some changes?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I have not made any determinations about personnel. I think Larry Summers and Tim Geithner have done an outstanding job, as have my whole economic team. This is tough, the work that they do. They\u2019ve been at it for two years, and they\u2019re going to have a whole range of decisions about family that will factor into this, as well. But the bottom line is, is that we\u2019re constantly thinking, is what we\u2019re doing working as well as it could? Do we have other options and other alternatives that we can explore?\n\nI think one of the things that's on a lot of people\u2019s minds right now, obviously, for example, is the issue of deficits and debt. That has fanned a lot of people\u2019s concerns because we had to take a lot of emergency decisions last year that cost money. Now, they were the right things to do. Had we not taken them, the economy would be in a much worse position. Even John McCain\u2019s former economist during the campaign has said that if we hadn\u2019t taken these steps, that we might have lost another 8 million jobs, and we would be in an even deeper hole.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: And we know you have that commission that reports in December, but I think a lot of Americans may wonder how serious you are about what that commission is going to do.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let me tell you. We\u2019ve already identified $250 billion in cuts on the discretionary side of our budget. We\u2019ve identified $300 billion worth of loopholes in our tax code that are not helping economic growth. If we just did those two things, as I\u2019ve already proposed, that would make a huge difference. We\u2019ve proposed to freeze discretionary spending for three years, to start whittling down some of the debt that I inherited.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Peter Orszag, as you know, your former budget director, says that we can\u2019t afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for anyone after a year or two. Is he right?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to make sure I get this gentleman\u2019s question in, but I will say this. The debate that we\u2019re having about tax cuts right now I think really speaks to the choices that everybody here is going to be facing as we go forward. I think all of us are concerned about the deficit; all of us are concerned about the debt. Now, what we\u2019ve said is that we should extend tax cuts, tax relief, for middle-class Americans -- like most of the audience here -- because, first of all, you\u2019re the ones who didn't see your wages or income rise. Second of all, you\u2019re the folks who are most likely to spend it on a new computer for your kids, or in some other fashion that would boost demand in the economy.\n\nEverybody agrees that this should be done. All we\u2019ve said is that you get those tax breaks up to $250,000 a year. After that, if you make more than $250,000 a year, you still get a tax break; it\u2019s just you only get it up to $250,000 --\n\nMR. HARWOOD: House Speak Pelosi said last week --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And let me say this, John, because I just think it\u2019s very important that everybody understands this. What the Republicans are proposing is that we, in addition to that, provide tax relief to primarily millionaires and billionaires. It would cost us $700 billion to do it. On average, millionaires would get a check of $100,000.\n\nAnd by the way, I would be helped by this, so I just want to be clear. I\u2019m speaking against my own financial interests. This is a -- it is a irresponsible thing for us to do. Those folks are the least likely to spend it and -- (applause.)\n\nMR. HARWOOD: Well, let me ask you from this angle. House Speaker Pelosi last week said you can get 80 percent of the revenue if you simply take away the tax cuts for people over a million dollars. Are you open to any sort of compromise that would capture most of that revenue, but those people between $250,000 and a million would get to keep that tax cut?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s the basic principle. Here\u2019s what I can\u2019t do as President. I think I\u2019ve worked pretty hard and I have a pretty big grasp of the challenges that we\u2019re facing. (Applause.) But here\u2019s what I can\u2019t do. I can\u2019t give tax cuts to the top 2 percent of Americans, 86 percent of that money going to people making a million dollars or more, and lower the deficit at the same time. I don\u2019t have the math.\n\nI would love to do it. Every -- anybody in elected office would love nothing more than to give everybody tax cuts, not cut services, make sure that I\u2019m providing help to student loans, make sure that we\u2019re keeping our roads safe and our bridges safe, and make sure that we\u2019re paying for our veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. At some point, the numbers just don\u2019t work.\n\nSo what I\u2019ve said is very simple. Let\u2019s go ahead and move forward on what we agree to, which is tax relief for 95 -- 97 percent of Americans. In fact, actually everybody would get tax relief, but just up to $250,000 a year more. And let\u2019s get the economy moving faster, let\u2019s get it growing faster. At some point in the future, if we want to have discussions about further lowering tax rates, let\u2019s do so at a time when we can actually afford it.\n\nMR. HARWOOD: All right, we\u2019ve kept this gentleman waiting long enough.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.\n\nQ Mr. President, it is an honor to be in front of you. I am a small business owner. I'm a third-generation business owner in Pennsylvania. We are actually celebrating our 100th-year anniversary because we were founded in 1910.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Congratulations. (Applause.) What\u2019s your business?\n\nQ Something called Susquehanna Glass, and we do monogrammed glasswork.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Outstanding.\n\nQ If you ever pick up a Williams-Sonoma catalog and buy a monogrammed glass, you\u2019re getting the stuff from me. (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Congratulations -- and your grandfather started this?\n\nQ My grandfather and his brother started the business, yes, three generations.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s outstanding. That\u2019s great.\n\nQ Two world wars, one Great Depression, and a lot of economic recession, so we\u2019ve been through a lot. What I have learned in running a small business over that period of time is that to succeed, to survive, you have to reinvest in your business. It simply is imperative. The single greatest economic challenge that I face today is a public that is fearful and negative.\n\nYou, when you first came into office, your stimulus package actually funded a very ailing financial system, which was essential for small businesspeople. You turned around and invested in the auto industry, and I believe saved millions of jobs, and I think you\u2019re actually going to make a profit on them. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We are. That's true.\n\nQ And yet your critics continue to paint you as a dramatically anti-business President. I believe you are investing in this country, as small businesses invest. And yet for some reason the public just doesn\u2019t get it. I need you to help us understand how you can regain the political center, because you\u2019re losing the war of sound bites, you\u2019re losing the media cycles.\n\nI have a son that just graduated from college. He was just commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army. He wants to make a career of the Army. I want to have a business for him to come back to when he gets out of the Army.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let me say to your son thank you for your service to our country, and we want to make sure we\u2019ve got a strong economy for him to come back to. (Applause.)\n\nAs I said before, I think that American businesses like yours are what make this country go. We have passed eight tax cuts for small businesses so far. We have made it easier for you to invest in plants and equipment. We have already taken down your capital gains and we want to reduce capital gains for small businesses down to zero. All of these things are what historically have been considered pro-business agendas.\n\nEven on health care, a lot of small businesses couldn\u2019t provide health care. We are now saying we\u2019ve giving you a tax break if you provide health care to your workers. And 4 million small businesses out there are in a position to potentially take advantage of it.\n\nBut what is absolutely true -- and this go. Please help me polish",

    "text":"In a recent speech at the White House Health Care Forum, former President Barack Obama emphasized the need for modernizing the healthcare system and investing in prevention to tackle skyrocketing costs. He also stressed the importance of greater accountability, eradicating discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions, and eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse in government programs.\n\nA key aspect that Obama highlighted was the importance of preserving the choices and preferences of Americans when it comes to their insurance coverage and doctors. He emphasized that if individuals are satisfied with their insurance plans and doctors, they should have the option to keep them while paying less for the care they receive.\n\nObama also underscored the need for an inclusive and transparent process to develop effective policies. To accomplish this, he invited representatives from various organizations, interests, and parties to join the forum. Additionally, citizens were given the opportunity to express their views in open meetings held across the country.\n\nAddressing the complexity of healthcare reform, Obama acknowledged that compromises would be necessary and no proposal would be perfect. However, he emphasized the urgency of taking action to address the unsustainable path of the healthcare system. He urged stakeholders to put aside personal agendas and work towards essential reforms that benefit all Americans.\n\nLastly, Obama made it clear that everyone has a right to participate in the discussion, but no one has the right to dominate or block any reform entirely. He vowed to work for the American people and rejected any attempts to maintain the status quo. \n\nObama showcased his commitment to the individuals he met during his campaign and throughout his time at the White House, highlighting their struggles and the difficult choices they face concerning their healthcare. He expressed a determination to improve access and affordability for all Americans.",

    "description":"Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes sit on opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in U.S....",
    "text":"Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes have emerged as opposing voices in the ongoing debate about the role of money in U.S. elections. The Kentucky Senate race has become a battleground for campaign cash, with both candidates and outside groups raising enormous amounts of money. It is expected to become the most expensive race in U.S. history, surpassing the $100 million mark.\n\nMitch McConnell, known for his stance on loosening campaign finance regulations, staunchly believes that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals. McConnell's position has made him the face of campaign finance deregulation.\n\nOn the other hand, in a statement to supporters on March 17, Alison Lundergan Grimes strongly condemned the influence of wealthy donors on elections and singled out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of the current system. Grimes stated, \"Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign... He\u2019s the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth's airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enough\u2014our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\"\n\nGrimes has been cautious on other controversial issues on the campaign trail, but her stance against the influence of money in politics has received applause from watchdog groups. David Donnelly, executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund, stated, \"It's very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again. She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of everyday Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating to make the problem worse.\"\n\nGrimes has also urged voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \"stop special interest billionaires,\" which has received support from red state Democratic senators. Kentucky's Senate race has seen the involvement of over 1,000 registered super PACs, generating over $141 million and spending more than $24.8 million on races.\n\nWhile McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million raised this cycle and has numerous outside groups spending millions on advertisements supporting his re-election, his approval ratings remain low. Grimes, on the other hand, either leads or ties McConnell in most polling.\n\nFormer FEC Chairman Michael Toner argues that while independent expenditure committees may not directly advance a candidate's interest, spending more money does not guarantee victory. Despite Grimes raising $4.5 million and receiving support from Democratic donors, she has faced attack ads from outside liberal groups who criticize McConnell.\n\nThe McConnell campaign highlighted the irony of Grimes criticizing Citizens United while benefiting from attack ads against the senator from liberal groups. Allison Moore, McConnell's campaign spokesperson, stated, \"Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections. The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact that the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\"\n\nWatchdog groups argue that while all elected officials and candidates benefit from wealthy donors, the real distinction lies in their actions to clean up the system. According to Donnelly, Grimes is seen as a champion for campaign finance reform, while McConnell is viewed as someone who will exacerbate the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kentucky Senate race between McConnell and Grimes has become a battleground for campaign finance, with record-breaking amounts of money being raised. The candidates' differing stances on the role of money in politics highlight the sharp divide on this issue. Despite the involvement of super PACs and attack ads, the outcome of the race remains uncertain.",

    "description":"As a\u00a0result of\u00a0the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to\u00a0Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.",
    "text":"Amidst the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. However, I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.\n\nIn recent developments, demonstrators in Crimea have been displaying signs in support of Russia, with slogans such as \"Putin is our president\" and \"Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!\" Over the weekend, in the city of Kerch, the Ukrainian flag was taken down from the city administration building and replaced with the Russian flag. Additionally, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol have blocked all entrances to the city to protect it, after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. Furthermore, a crowd of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city, who immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.\n\nWith President Vladimir Putin no longer occupied with the Olympics, it is anticipated that he will use the \"interests of Russians\" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, similar to the events in South Ossetia in 2008. It is important to note that Russia already has troops present in Crimea, as outlined in a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Although former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko intended to cancel this agreement, his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.\n\nInterestingly, I myself was born in Sevastopol. My birth certificate mentions Sevastopol as my birthplace but does not reference \"Ukrainian SSR,\" despite Crimea being given to Ukraine by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954. Crimea was originally part of Russia until Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the decision to unify Ukraine with Russia made by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nHowever, Khrushchev's gesture resulted in some confusion, as the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged the transfer. This is because, in 1948, Stalin issued a decree making Sevastopol an autonomous entity directly controlled by Moscow, removing it from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration. Consequently, Russia handed over Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.\n\nFor many years, this arrangement did not pose any significant issues. However, with the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent need to redefine borders between newly independent republics, tensions arose. Sevastopol, home to a significant naval base, has a majority of Russian residents who receive their salaries in rubles. Administratively, the city is Ukrainian, but this discrepancy has fueled ongoing debates and tensions between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, Sevastopol has been managed by two separate administrations: the city administration appointed by Kiev and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, which owns almost everything in the city.\n\nMy father, serving in the military, moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. Therefore, I cannot claim Sevastopol as my hometown, although I did visit a few times during my schooldays. During those visits, I never encountered signs written in Ukrainian or heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets, although this was a long time ago.\n\nSevastopol was officially mentioned as part of Ukraine in the Soviet Constitution of 1978, marking the beginning of its gradual assimilation into Ukraine. Many people considered it unfair that Sevastopol was included as part of Ukraine in the Belavezha Accords signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the presidents who signed these accords were elected through legitimate means, and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. It is unclear why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol or Crimea with Ukraine in 1991. According to the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords, the Ukrainian side anticipated that Yeltsin would insist on Russia regaining Crimea after the Soviet collapse. However, they were surprised when he never made such a demand.\n\nGiven the current situation, the only way Russia can change the scenario is by starting a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that despite Putin's assertive statements, he does not truly desire to engage in armed conflict. Instead, his aim in supporting separatists is to burden any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire with internal unrest and conflict. This approach is evident in Moscow's actions in self-proclaimed regions like Transdnestr, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia, suggesting that Putin might similarly seek to foster instability in Crimea.\n\nThere is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now, with Moscow providing substantial funding and encouragement to Ukrainian separatist movements. Historically, Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it remains unclear how far Putin is willing to escalate the situation this time to intensify those difficulties.",

    "text":"President Obama delivered an impassioned speech at Scranton High School in Scranton, Pennsylvania, advocating for the extension of tax cuts for middle-class Americans. The President stressed the importance of providing support to working families and strengthening the economy during these challenging times.\n\nDuring his speech, President Obama highlighted the economic struggles faced by many Americans over the past decade, including job losses, stagnant wages, and rising costs of education and healthcare. He emphasized that the American Dream of hard work leading to success was slipping away for many people and called for renewed efforts to rebuild the economy.\n\nPresident Obama outlined his American Jobs Act, a comprehensive jobs bill aimed at creating more employment opportunities and putting more money in the pockets of working families. The bill received bipartisan support and was backed by independent economists who projected it could create up to 2 million jobs and boost the economy by as much as 2 percent.\n\nHowever, the President expressed disappointment in the Senate's refusal to debate the bill and the lack of support from Republicans. He called on Congress to reconsider and vote in favor of the American Jobs Act, specifically highlighting the need to extend tax cuts for middle-class families.\n\nThe President stressed the importance of extending the payroll tax cut, set to expire at the end of the year. He explained that failing to extend this tax cut would result in a $1,000 increase in taxes for the average middle-class family, which would also have a detrimental impact on the economy as it continues to recover from the recession.\n\nPresident Obama urged Congress to prioritize the needs of working families over protecting tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. He reiterated his belief in the collective responsibility Americans have in supporting and uplifting one another. Asking the wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share, he argued, would help create a more balanced and prosperous society.\n\nThe President called on the American people to voice their support for the extension of tax cuts to their senators, emphasizing the power of individual voices in shaping government actions. He urged Congress to put partisanship aside and work together to pass the American Jobs Act, emphasizing that America's best days lie ahead when its citizens unite in pursuit of progress.\n\nPresident Obama concluded his speech by reminding the audience that America has always risen to the occasion during challenging times and expressed his confidence in the resilience and determination of the American people.",

    "text":"U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith has been vocal about his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and has made several claims criticizing the agency. One of his recent claims, made in a February newsletter to constituents, is that the EPA treats milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. However, a closer look at the facts reveals that Griffith's claim is misleading and exaggerated.\n\nGriffith argues that a new ruling by the EPA forces dairy farmers to comply with the same regulations as oil and natural gas producers when dealing with milk spills. He suggests that this is an outrageous and unnecessary burden on dairy farmers. However, the claim is not entirely accurate.\n\nA visit to the EPA's website reveals that milk has actually been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act was passed by Congress. The law defines milk as an oil, as it contains a percentage of animal fats. Therefore, milk spills have been subject to regulations for the past 38 years and this is not a new ruling, as Griffith suggests.\n\nGriffith's claim also fails to acknowledge that the SPCC rule applies only to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk. So smaller dairy farms storing a limited amount of milk would not be affected by these regulations.\n\nIn fact, the EPA made a rule change in 2009, which is set to go into effect soon, that actually exempts milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. The change states that milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances would be exempt from SPCC requirements as long as they meet specific sanitary standards and adhere to pasteurization laws.\n\nIt is important to note that the change in regulations primarily applies to large-scale dairy farms that store petroleum products, such as gasoline or fuel oil, in significant quantities. It does not affect the majority of dairy farmers or the storage of milk itself.\n\nGriffith's claim seems to have been influenced by an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, which also misinterpreted the EPA's rule change. However, as a congressman, Griffith has a responsibility to ensure the accuracy of his statements and should have verified the information before making such claims.\n\nIn conclusion, Morgan Griffith's statement that a \"new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply\" with strict spill regulations, similar to those imposed on oil and natural gas companies, is false. The regulations for milk spills have been in place for several decades and the recent rule change actually exempts milk from certain spill standards. It is important for public officials to provide accurate information to the public, particularly when discussing important environmental regulations.",

    "text":"f the nine items that the Clinton campaign has highlighted as something \"every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump\" is his plan to eliminate gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. While Trump himself has not publicly discussed this proposal at length, it has drawn attention and raised concerns.\n\nThe Gun-Free School Zones Act, enacted in 1990, makes it illegal to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone. However, states have the authority to decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states currently prohibit concealed carry. There is a debate among advocates on both sides of the gun-rights and gun-control spectrum as to whether the law preventing firearms on school grounds actually deters or motivates potential attackers.\n\nSince the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, some states have introduced legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In response, at least 33 states introduced over 80 bills in 2013 alone, authorizing school districts to permit certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms. Additionally, more states have been considering laws that allow guns on college campuses.\n\nWhile Trump has been vocal about his opposition to gun-free zones at military bases and has expressed his desire to repeal them, he has not spoken as openly about doing the same for schools. The only time he spoke about it publicly was at a rally in Vermont in January 2016, where he stated that he would eliminate gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. However, he did not provide specific details about how this would be achieved or what the implications would be.\n\nTrump's response to questions about his proposal during an interview with the Outdoor Channel also lacked specifics. He indicated that he would work with the states and potentially override them if necessary. However, it remains unclear if he would propose repealing the federal ban on guns in school zones or make it illegal for states to pass laws prohibiting concealed carry at schools.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump has not provided many specifics regarding his proposal, it is evident that he intends to force states to allow guns in schools. Whether this would be achieved through a repeal of the federal ban or through other means is still unclear. However, Trump's intention to make this happen on his first day as president is clear.",

    "text":"In a stirring speech delivered on the Senate floor, Senator Jeff Flake expressed his concerns about the erosion of truth in American democracy and the attacks on the free press. He emphasized that without truth and a commitment to shared facts, our democracy cannot survive.\n\nFlake condemned the use of \"alternative facts\" by the Trump administration as a justification for falsehoods. He highlighted the relentless assault on the free press by the White House, referring to President Trump's labeling of the media as \"the enemy of the people.\" Flake compared this rhetoric to that used by Josef Stalin, expressing his deep concern.\n\nThe senator argued that it is the duty of those in power to uphold the truth, not to undermine it. He praised the courage of journalists who risk their lives to report the truth, emphasizing that their work should not be dismissed as \"fake news.\"\n\nFlake raised concerns about the spread of untruths by politicians, pointing out the dangerous consequences of denying the reality of Russian interference in the U.S. elections. He criticized the lack of action on this matter and warned that ignoring or denying the truth leaves the country vulnerable to further attacks.\n\nThe senator expressed his disappointment with President Trump's intention to announce \"corrupt and dishonest\" media awards via Twitter. He called the spectacle disgraceful and stressed the need for 2018 to be the year when truth takes a stand against those who seek to weaken it.\n\nFlake highlighted examples of foreign leaders using the term \"fake news\" to justify repression and undermine free speech. He warned that the authoritarian impulse to challenge free societies is resurfacing worldwide, and it is essential to confront it.\n\nIn conclusion, Flake emphasized that it is the press's responsibility to uncover the truth about those in power. He quoted President John F. Kennedy, who said, \"For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\"\n\nFlake called for an end to the attacks on truth and urged his colleagues to support the truth and defend democratic institutions. He closed his speech with a hymn, emphasizing that truth is eternal and will withstand the worst challenges.",

    "description":"Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun",
    "text":"Conservative radio talk show host, Laura Ingraham, recently made a statement on Fox News Sunday, suggesting that the widely cited statistic claiming 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases was false. However, fact-checkers have found her claim to be inaccurate.\n\nA number of respected polls conducted in 2015 consistently reveal significant support for expanded background checks for gun purchases. For instance, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in December 2015 found that 89 percent of respondents supported requiring background checks for people buying guns at gun shows or online. A CBS\/New York Times poll from October 2015 showed that 92 percent of respondents favored a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers. Similarly, a Gallup poll conducted in the same month found that 86 percent of respondents favored a law mandating universal background checks for all gun purchases.\n\nThese polls show a strong trend of support for background checks, with results consistently hovering around the 90 percent mark. Pew Research Center's 2015 survey further demonstrated that support for background checks is not limited to specific partisan or demographic groups, and it even extends to a majority of households that own guns.\n\nDespite Ingraham's claim, there is no definitive debunking of the statistic. Some gun rights advocates have contested the survey questions used in these polls, arguing that they refer to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. This distinction may explain why support for general gun control measures does not necessarily translate into support for expanding gun control policies.\n\nWhile people overwhelmingly favor specific gun control policies, such as universal background checks and preventing suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, the support becomes less robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control measures. A CBS\/New York Times poll found that 46 percent of Americans believe gun sales laws should either remain the same or be made less strict, while only 51 percent felt the laws should be more strict.\n\nIn conclusion, Ingraham's claim that the 90 percent statistic supporting background checks has been debunked is false. Multiple respected polls from 2015 consistently demonstrate strong support for expanded background checks among Americans. While there may be some dispute over the interpretation of these findings and the level of support for specific legislation, there has been no definitive debunking of the overall statistic.",
