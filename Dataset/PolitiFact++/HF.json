Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.\n\nHe did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.\n\nColin Taylor Opinion columnist and former editor-in-chief of Occupy Democrats.

I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBerman: \u201cIn your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?\u201d\n\nHorner: \u201cWhen no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn\u2019t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.\u201d\n\nBerman: \u201cYour book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various \u201ctortures\u201d that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?\u201d\n\nHorner: \u201cBecause I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBerman: \u201cCan you give us any insight on Obama\u2019s feelings towards the American people?\u201d\n\nHorner: \u201cHe constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as \u201cmongoloids\u201d and \u201cidiots\u201d. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.\u201d\n\nBerman: What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking?\n\nHorner: \u201cProbably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama\u2019s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I\u2019ve ever witnessed. We\u2019re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.\u201d\n\nTo read more, pick up a copy of Horner\u2019s book, The Black House, now available on Amazon and at your local bookstore.\n\nVIDEO: Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book",

According to the FDA\u2019s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.\n\nThese adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion\/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.\n\nIn this sense, it should be noted that:\n\nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.\n\nWhat\u2019s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?\n\nAccording to the Tripedia\u2019s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.\n\nWhat is the content of these two growth mediums?\n\nMueller and Miller medium, contains:\n\nGlucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nWhile Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:\n\nTris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.\n\nThe vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (\u22640.3 \u03bcg mercury\/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 \u03bcg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.\n\n\u201cProbable cause\u201d ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG\u2014an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.\n\nYou might be wondering:\n\nWhy the doctors don\u2019t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?\n\nThat is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine\n\nTo take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!\n\nIt\u2019s time for Congress to rescind the \u201cGet out of Jail Free\u201d card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.\n\nIt\u2019s about time vaccines are publicly acknowledged by the feds and the media for all the health damages they have caused. Just check out the CDC\u2019s VAERS reports and the vaccine damage payouts by the HHS\/HRSA. According to a new report published on March 1, 2017, by the department of health and human services of the United States, about $ 3,363,282,409.21 have been paid for vaccine adverse reactions and deaths from 1989 to 2017 so far.\n\nTo conclude, what do you think about this?

According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyan\u2019s office has asserted that he can not be \u201cfired\u201d by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump\u2019s statement about women and pussy grabbing.

He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker\u2026You\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that.",

But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.\n\nAxios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, \u201cIn loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem\u2019s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nRelated: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich\u2019s Murder\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.\n\nMedia reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, \u201cThose who have suggested that Seth\u2019s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.\u201d\n\nSAUL LOEB\/AFP\/Getty\n\nRich appears elsewhere in Brazile\u2019s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich\u2019s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.\n\nBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.\u201d\n\nBrazile had spoken publicly about Rich\u2019s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, \u201cSeth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth\u2019s legacy to his country and party is shameful.\u201d About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, \u201cSeth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.\u201d\n\nThrough spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, \u201cSince Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family\u2019s efforts to find Seth\u2019s killers.\u201d\n\nIn the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters seemed \u201cantiseptic, like a hospital,\u201d and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a \u201cslave.\u201d In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.\n\nFormer aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile\u2019s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, \u201cIt is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nBrazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.",

The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.\n\nThe second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.\n\nBill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.\n\nThe irony of Bill Gates\u2019 faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.\n\nLast year, India\u2019s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting \u201cto make people healthier\u201d were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls \u2014 and that the Gates Foundation \u201ccampaigns\u201d were actually \u201cexperimental trials of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nMainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.\n\nThe \u201cphilanthropist\u201d has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who \u201chave no benefit whatsoever\u201d to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic \u201clogic\u201d is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century\u2019s most evil regimes.\n\nNow we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates\u2019 depopulation agenda playing out around the world.\n\nKenya doesn\u2019t find his Gates\u2019 fake concern for the human race amusing either.

Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,\u201d Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.\n\nGates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.\n\nLet\u2019s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?\n\nNone of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

    "text":"The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues.\n\nThis muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding:\n\nAnabolic Drugs Or Steroids\n\nAnabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain.\n\nThese hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein.\n\nBeta-2 Agonists\n\nThese synthetic drugs help expand the lungs\u2019 capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety.\n\nHuman Growth Hormone\n\nAlso referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH.\n\nEphedrine\n\nBodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles.\n\nMethenolone\n\nMethenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it.",

Would Hillary Clinton sacrifice the Democrat party, which is now basically defunct, for a few years of freedom before she finally gags on her own sins and dies? You bet she would.\n\nNow the question is: Did anyone do anything illegal? Ryan certainly could face an investigation into his professional ethics if nothing else. He\u2019s the Speaker of the House. He doesn\u2019t make policy, he leads the body that makes policy. Big difference.\n\nSOURCE",

Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation\u2019s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the \u201clargest scam\u201d that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.\n\nThe scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:\n\n\u201cOfficials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.\n\nFederal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.\n\nOne of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.\n\nFederal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam\u2019s value.\n\n\u2018Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,\u2019 Sessions said.\n\nA physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.\u201d\n\nThe ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers\u2019 noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here\u2019s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet\u2026all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.\n\nOther nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid\u2019s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.\n\nMore than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit. Other Muslim defendants include:\n\nMashiyat Rashid, of Oakland County \u2013 controlled, owned or operated Global Quality, Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians, Tri-State Physicians, New Center Medical, National Laboratories, and Tri-County Wellness;\n\nYasser Mozeb, of Oakland County \u2013 allegedly received payments from Global Quality and Tri-County Wellness;\n\nAbdul Haq, of Washtenaw County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians and Tri-State Physicians;\n\nJoseph Betro, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians and New Center Medical;\n\nTariz Omar, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.\n\nMohammed Zahoor, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department isn\u2019t messing around, as the defendants are being brought up on a plethora of federal charges, including five counts of health care fraud and health care fraud conspiracy. Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashid\u2019s companies\u2019 fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country.\n\nWe must continue to sound the alarm about what\u2019s going right underneath our noses. This isn\u2019t the first time that Muslims have ripped off Americans with fraud, and with the hordes of migrants that liberals keep fighting to bring into our country, stories like this will sadly become the new norm if the American people do not wake the hell up soon!",

    "text":"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, \u201cincluding thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama\u2019s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.\n\nIt was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges\u2013 no trial\u2013just belief.\n\nHis intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 \u2014 teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught \u2014 and he wanted to attack this loophole. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?\u201d Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held \u2014 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.\n\nLets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don\u2019t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in \u201cfacilities\u201d so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that the program\u2019s real intent is to interrogate the kids,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are \u201coften questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.\u201d While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer\u2019s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative\u2019s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.\n\nBut the program was a surprise to Mexico\n\n\u201cThe moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn\u2019t an announcement,\u201d said Reyna Torres Mend\u00edvil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry\u2019s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. \u201cWhere were they taking these children?\u201d\n\nRegarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.\n\nBelow is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.\n\n\ufeff\n\nNote: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.\n\nillegal immigrants\n\nillegal immigrants\n\nillegal immigrants",

In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.\n\nThe men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.\n\nNow, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster \u2014 which is \u201cillegal\u201d in California \u2014 and put both men down in seconds.\n\nProsecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was \u201cextreme and unnecessary.\u201d The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:\n\n\u201cMr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men\u2019s initial wounds were superficial.\n\nWhile they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn\u2019t \u2018denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.\n\nHallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn\u2019t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.\u201d\n\nReligious persecution?

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\nRich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\n\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all.

    "text":"Snopes Paid to Push \u2018Propaganda\u2019 by Facebook, Former Editor Reveals\n\nClaims 'fact-checkers' are paid to 'appear to prevent damage' while pushing an agenda\n\n\u00a9 press Former managing editor at Snopes Brooke Binkowski says the 'fact-checker' is pushing 'propaganda'\n\nSnopes is paid by Facebook to push \"propaganda,\" according to the former managing editor of the \"fact-checker,\" who claims the social media giant \"doesn't care\" about facts and is using journalists to promote an agenda so it can \"pass the buck.\"\n\nAccording to a bombshell report by the Guardian, several current and former Facebook fact-checkers have stepped forward and spoken out to reveal their distrust in the social network and their fact-checking employers.\n\nFacebook has fact-checking partnerships with Snopes, PolitiFact, Factcheck.org, the Weekly Standard, and Associated Press, and uses the information provided by these organizations to reduce the reach of posts that are \"debunked\" in their News Feed.\n\nThe partnering with these fact-checkers has come under heavy criticism, mainly due to the almost-monopolized influence news on Facebook has, which is then being filtered out by unregulated individuals who are often financially motivated and express political bias.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve essentially used us for crisis PR,\u201d declared former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski during an interview with the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not taking anything seriously.\n\n\"They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buck\u2026\n\n\"They clearly don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not doing journalism anymore. You\u2019re doing propaganda,\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cThey threw us under the bus at every opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnother former Snopes employee, Kim LaCapria, recently left the company over its partnership with Facebook, accusing it of focusing only on the \u201cappearance of trying to prevent damage without actually doing anything,\u201d and expressing distaste with the fact that Snopes was being paid by Facebook.\n\nLaCapria said she was particularly upset to learn that Facebook was paying Snopes: \u201cThat felt really gross \u2026 Facebook has one mission and fact-checking websites should have a completely different mission.\u201d\n\nAside from allegedly being paid by Facebook, Snopes also generates revenue by filling its website with advertisements from Google Adsense, asking for donations from readers via PayPal, and has an active GoFundMe campaign to \"Save Snopes\" which has so far generated over $850,000 of its $2 million goal.\n\nOf course, it's understandable that a website has overheads that need to be covered, but when a company is primarily driven by profit, how can they be trusted to remain non-partisan?\n\nAccording to a report by the Daily Mail, Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused of embezzling thousands from the company.\n\nMikkelson's ex-wife Barbara, claimed in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on \"himself and prostitutes.\"\n\nDuring the lengthy and bitter legal dispute, CEO David Mikkelson also claimed to be underpaid and was demanding the \"industry standard\" or at least $360,000 a year.\n\nBeing motivated by \"facts\" is apparently very lucrative.\n\nAnd in the case of Snopes, their business model is a simple, yet devastatingly effective one since they partnered with Facebook and Google: They debunk viral news, and posts.\n\nTherefore, if a post goes viral on social media, and Snopes says that it's \"false,\" then it will be flagged as so and Facebook will place a link to the \"fact-check,\" thus driving more traffic and revenue to Snopes.\n\nDue to this arrangement, it adds a clear incentive to mark a viral news story as false rather than confirming lesser-known facts as true.\n\n\u00a9 press Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused on embezzling company money\n\nOver recent months this push to flag big news stories as \"false,\" mainly from conservative websites, has become more apparent.\n\nIn November, Breitbart accused Snopes of attempting to \"wash away\" the story of armed members of the New Black Panther Party campaigning for the Democrat gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, Stacey Abrams.\n\nAccording to Breitbart, the move was an \"openly partisan\" attempt to protect Abrams after the damaging story went viral.\n\nEarlier this month, The Daily Caller also accused Snopes of left-bias after it \"botched\" its fact-check of a viral meme that was mocked within political circles for spreading false information.\n\nSnopes said that the \u201cgeneral idea\u201d of the meme was \u201ccorrect,\u201d yet, according to the TheDCNF, the fact-checker intentionally framed it that way as it portrayed President Trump in a negative light if the \"wildly misleading\" meme was true.\n\nIn Snopes \"transparency\" disclaimer, it states that it operates \"without any partisan considerations,\" saying:\n\n\"We don\u2019t choose or exclude items for coverage based on whether they deal with Republican\/Democratic, conservative\/liberal, or religious\/secular issues.\"\n\nDespite this statement, the left-leaning bias of their fact-checkers is clear.\n\nSnopes' \"science dude\" Alex Kasprak makes no secret of his political bias, and one look at his Twitter account shows it is filled with anti-Trump rhetoric and retweets of Trump-bashing posts.\n\nThe only way to report on that \"totally clears the president\" tweet is to highlight it as an example of our president's abject delusion, not as a valid legal opinion or as \"breaking news\" \u2014 Alex H. Kasprak (@alexkasprak) December 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to joining Snopes, Kasprak wrote for left-wing news outlets Motherboard and BuzzFeed and is pegged as a \"science writer\" who mainly \"debunks\" science-related articles.\n\nIt comes as no surprise then that Kasprak mainly fact-checks conservative news sites, often using derogatory language when describing the outlets and their writers, using terms such as \"right-wing blog\" and \"junk news.\"\n\nBiting the hand that feeds\n\nSnopes apparent bias has seen the company suffer considerably over recent months as it continues to abuse its influence over Facebook's News Feed to promote a political agenda.\n\nVisits to snopes.com have plummeted by almost half over recent months as users are seemingly losing trust in the organization.\n\nAccording to website data tool SimilarWeb, visits to Snopes dropped another 20 percent in November to 19.59 million for the month.\n\nThis number is a considerable drop from their July figure of 37.79 million, representing a staggering 48.16 percent drop in website traffic in just four months.\n\nWhile it's unclear what has caused this drop, when you consider that being flagged as \"fake news\" on Facebook cuts reach to the websites being debunked, it's clear to see that attacking the sources of their viral \"fact-checks,\" is hardly sustainable if it destroys the sites that it continually attacks.\n\n\u00a9 SimilarWeb Website visits to Snopes have plummeted by almost 50 percent since July\n\nThe appearance of trying to prevent damage\n\n\u201cWhy should we trust Facebook when it\u2019s pushing the same rumors that its own fact checkers are calling fake news?\u201d an unnamed Facebook fact-checker told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth asking how do they treat stories about George Soros on the platform knowing they specifically pay people to try to link political enemies to him?[\u2026] Working with Facebook makes us look bad.\u201d\n\nAccording to Breitbart, one fact-checker who has reportedly \u201clong worked\u201d with Facebook even referred to the social network as a \u201cterrible company,\u201d declaring, \u201cand, on a personal level, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them,\u201d while another fact-checker proclaimed, \u201cMost of us feel it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nFacebook started its fact-checking efforts following President Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election victory and is even expanding into fact-checking images and videos.\n\nLeft-wing biases have been found at nearly all Facebook fact-check partners in the United States, including Snopes, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard.\n\nAn investigation revealed that Snopes employs left-wing people almost exclusively, with some of its most prominent fact-checkers openly describing themselves as \u201cprogressive\u201d and expressing anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nA satirical article from popular satire website Babylon Bee about CNN using a washing machine to \u201cspin the news,\u201d was also nearly removed by Facebook after Snopes fact-checked it as false.\n\nOne of Facebook\u2019s other top fact-checking partners, Politifact, is funded by a frequent Clinton Foundation donor, and gave preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election \u2014 rating 51 percent of Clinton\u2019s claims as true versus just over 15 percent for Trump.\n\nEven a 2013 article from one of Facebook\u2019s other fact-checking partners, the Weekly Standard, claimed Politifact \u201chas it out for Republicans,\u201d and the Weekly Standard itself has also pushed out misleading information during its partnership with Facebook.\n\nUPDATE: Since this article was published, and subsequently went viral on social media, Snopes CEO David Mikkelson denied the information we presented in this article. Snopes didn't \"fact-check\" or \"debunk\" any of the information, nor did they present any evidence to refute the claims. Mikkelson, however, saw fit to abuse his position as Facebook approved \"fact-checker\" and flagged our story as a \"hoax\" with Facebook, pulling it from users' News Feed, immediately squashing the story as a result. Make of that what you will.",

    "text":"Update: On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials who he alleges are involved in these hackings and leaks. You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below.\n\nOriginal post: There\u2019s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn\u2019t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails.\n\nThe hacking and release of leading political figures\u2019 emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia\u2019s government. And it\u2019s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what \u201ccollusion\u201d between Donald Trump\u2019s team and the Russians might have involved.\n\nThat\u2019s not mere speculation. We\u2019ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don\u2019t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance \u2014 but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nThese hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them). The operation was more wide-ranging than many remember, targeting not just John Podesta and the DNC but many other people and groups. It wasn\u2019t just emails stolen, either \u2014 posted material ranged from Democratic Party turnout data that a Republican operative thought was \u201cprobably worth millions of dollars\u201d to even a purported picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport.\n\nNo charges have been filed in the matter \u2014 yet. But some are likely coming. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the US has identified \u201cmore than six members of the Russian government\u201d involved in the DNC hacks. And the Daily Beast wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d a leading figure in the hacks. Mueller is now overseeing the probe.\n\nTo understand what happened in 2016, we have to understand the hackings. And though some mysteries remain, much of the complex story has gradually been pieced together by journalists and cybersecurity experts. The consequences, of course, unfolded in plain sight during the campaign itself.\n\nHow the hacks happened (a phishing expedition)\n\nThe media often shorthands the 2016 hack story as: Russians hacked Podesta and the DNC\u2019s email accounts, and WikiLeaks then posted those hacked emails publicly.\n\nThe full story is more complex. Let\u2019s start at the beginning.\n\nBetween March 2015 and May 2016, a group of hackers went on a phishing expedition. The \u201cbaited lines\u201d they cast out were at least 19,000 malicious emails that resembled the one below:\n\nThese emails were designed to look as if they were coming from Google. But they were in fact designed to trick people into clicking through and entering their login credentials \u2014 delivering them right into the hackers\u2019 hands.\n\nAccording to a later Associated Press analysis of a report by the information security firm SecureWorks, at least 573 of the more than 4,700 email addresses targeted were American. They included many US government officials, military officials, intelligence officials, and defense contractors.\n\nParticularly beginning in March and April 2016, these targets began to include many Democrats as well. Per the AP, more than 130 Democratic accounts were sent these malicious links, compared to just \u201ca handful\u201d of Republican accounts. Podesta and several Clinton staffers \u2014 along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, and others \u2014 had their accounts successfully compromised. (We know all this because the hackers used the link-shortening tool Bitly to do their work and accidentally left their activity publicly viewable.)\n\nRussia was eventually blamed for the phishing expedition, for several reasons. For one, SecureWorks concluded the particular malware used in this campaign was tied to a hacking group that outside researchers had been tracking for some time \u2014 a group they thought to be linked the GRU, Russia\u2019s foreign military intelligence agency. We don\u2019t know what the secretive hacking group calls itself, but various cybersecurity researchers had given it several names: Iron Twilight, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) 28, Pawn Storm, and \u2014 most famously \u2014 \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\n\nCircumstantial evidence also suggests a Russian-tied culprit. For instance, the phishers were extremely focused on Ukraine \u2014 at least 545 targeted email accounts were from there, comparable to the number of American targets. These included Ukraine\u2019s president and many other top government officials, who are hostile to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nThe Russians targeted, meanwhile, were generally critics of Putin\u2019s government and journalists. Another interesting detail, per the AP, is that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were created between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday \u2014 Moscow time.\n\nAround April 2016, as this phishing campaign increasingly began to target Democrats, material was also taken from the DNC. The firm Crowdstrike attributed this as a hack from Fancy Bear, citing the malware used, and other firms agreed with this assessment. These firms also concluded that a separate group of Russian-tied hackers (dubbed \u201cCozy Bear\u201d) had been in the DNC\u2019s systems for much longer, since all the way back in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe precise mechanisms of how the DNC was breached remain somewhat murky. But Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign did send out malicious links to nine DNC email accounts in March and April 2016. And as we\u2019ll soon see, hacked DNC material ended up in the same place as hacked material from Podesta and others. A January 2017 US intelligence report would later specifically blame Russia\u2019s GRU \u2014 the agency thought to be behind Fancy Bear \u2014 for taking \u201clarge volumes of data from the DNC.\u201d\n\nAs striking as all this may seem, though, government-backed hacking is far from unusual. The US does it. Our allies do it. Our rivals do it. China was said to have hacked Barack Obama and John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and was then tied to a massive theft of federal data in 2015. Foreign intelligence agencies trying to peek into political activities seemed to be something that just, well, happened all the time.\n\nWhat came next in 2016, however, was a jarring departure from these norms \u2014 the hacked information began to be posted publicly, in massive amounts.\n\nA timeline of odd events between the hacks and the leaks\n\nThe backdrop to all of this was the US presidential election \u2014 the first series of primaries and caucuses took place in February and early March. The surprisingly Russia-friendly Donald Trump emerged as the clear leader in the Republican contest, over his Putin-critical rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, with whom Putin\u2019s regime had long had chilly relations, emerged as the favorite for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders.\n\nIt was around this point \u2014 in mid-March 2016 \u2014 that the phishing campaign began to particularly target many Democrats\u2019 and Clinton campaign staffers\u2019 email accounts, according to SecureWorks\u2019 analysis.\n\nThere were several other events that, in retrospect, are either relevant or at the very least intriguing:\n\nApril 7: Putin condemns the Panama Papers leak . In early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth \u2014 the Panama Papers. Many of the documents revealed financial information about Putin\u2019s inner circle, and Putin publicly claimed the stories were part of a US plot against Russia. \u201cThey are trying to destabilize us from within in order to make us more compliant,\u201d he said. Many have posited that the Russian government may have then wished to retaliate.\n\nIn early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth \u2014 the Panama Papers.

Many have posited that the Russian government may have then wished to retaliate. April 19: The domain for DCLeaks, a website that would eventually post many hacked documents, is registered .

(US intelligence agencies have said Russia\u2019s GRU is behind the site.) April 26: George Papadopoulos g e t s an intriguing tip . Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, sat down in London with a professor named Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud told him he\u2019d just traveled to Moscow and met high-level Russian government officials.

DCLeaks\u2019 posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties. That\u2019s because they included the hacked emails of retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, who had commanded NATO forces in Europe and pushed for a harder line against Russia in Ukraine. They also included documents from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.)\n\nDCLeaks\u2019 posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties.

They also included documents from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.) June 9: The Trump Tower meeting: Shortly afterward, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met a Russian lawyer and four other people with Russian ties at Trump Tower. Don Jr. had agreed to take the meeting based on the promise of \u201cofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary,\u201d as part of \u201cRussia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u201d (as it was put to him in an email). Everyone involved claims nothing came of this meeting.\n\nThroughout all this time, there was no public indication that the phishing campaign, or the hacking of the DNC and other campaign figures\u2019 emails, had taken place. Just days later, that would change.\n\nThe email leaks begin\n\nOn June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a bombshell. \u201cWe have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d he announced, during a British television interview. \u201cWe have emails pending publication.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks \u2014 a nonprofit launched back in 2006 by Assange, an Australian activist \u2014 had previously been most famous for posting a plethora of internal US military documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (including video of a deadly airstrike) and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the US State Department \u2014 leaked by Chelsea Manning. Assange was then accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, and he sought political asylum from Ecuador. He has been holed up in the nation\u2019s London embassy since June 2012.\n\nAssange\u2019s announcement was the first public indication that Democrats would soon be plagued by leaked internal emails. So two days after that, the DNC, which had learned of the hacking of its systems and hired Crowdstrike to respond, decided to get in front of what it feared was coming. The committee told the Washington Post that it had been hacked \u2014 by, it claimed, the Russian government. Crowdstrike\u2019s CEO put up a blog post explaining why he identified Russia as the culprit.\n\nYet the next day, June 15, things got even weirder \u2014 because that is when \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d arrived on the scene. (The name, a portmanteau of \u201cGucci\u201d and \u201cLucifer,\u201d is an homage to the original Guccifer, the jailed Romanian hacker Marcel Leher Lazar, who\u2019d broken into high-profile Americans\u2019 email accounts.)\n\nIn a Wordpress post, the new Guccifer said that Crowdstrike was quite wrong about the DNC hack, which he said was carried out by him, \u201ca lone hacker.\u201d (\u201cFuck CrowdStrike!!!\u201d he wrote.) He said that he\u2019d given \u201cthe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails\u201d that he\u2019d stolen, to WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks has refused to confirm that he was its source.) He also began to post several documents he claimed were from the DNC server.\n\nAlmost immediately, journalists pointed to inconsistencies in Guccifer\u2019s story and linguistic tics to suggest he was Russian \u2014 or more than one Russian. (US intelligence agencies would eventually say Russia\u2019s GRU was behind the persona, and the Daily Beast recently reported that the account\u2019s user once slipped up and neglected to mask his identity through a VPN \u2014 allowing investigators to match a particular Russian intelligence officer to that Guccifer 2.0 login.)\n\nYet what Guccifer had access to was clearly broader than just the DNC. None of the first documents he posted showed up in WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC email dump, and in fact, many of them eventually showed up in John Podesta\u2019s emails, which were released much later. Additionally, on June 27, Guccifer emailed the Smoking Gun\u2019s William Bastone a link to a password-protected post on DCLeaks.com that contained phished emails and documents from Clinton staffer Sarah Hamilton. (DCLeaks had not yet publicly posted any material related to the election.)\n\nOn July 6, Guccifer 2.0 posted his first documents that would eventually be found in the DNC emails. The New Yorker\u2019s Raffi Khatchadourian speculates, based on some comments Guccifer made to journalists at the time, that Guccifer or his handlers were frustrated that WikiLeaks was taking too long to actually post the DNC material and were threatening to spoil Assange\u2019s exclusive. (A week later, Guccifer would send documents to the Hill\u2019s Joe Uchill, writing that he was doing so because the press was \u201cgradually forget[ing] about me,\u201d and complained that WikiLeaks was \u201cplaying for time.\u201d)\n\nAll the while, Assange and WikiLeaks were working to prepare their database of DNC emails, with the apparent goal of publishing them before the Democratic convention began in late July. It\u2019s unclear how they set that goal. Assange would later tell Khatchadourian that he originally had a deadline of July 18 to release them, but \u201cwe were given a little more time.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear, though, who gave him more time, and Assange later disputed the accuracy of the recorded quote.)\n\nFinally, on July 22 \u2014 the Friday before the convention \u2014 WikiLeaks posted those thousands of DNC emails and attachments online. They revealed that many DNC members privately spoke of Bernie Sanders with disdain, drove DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top staffers to resign, and overall made an ugly start for the Democratic convention. Though Assange remained mum on his source, Guccifer 2.0 jubilantly claimed credit in a tweet:\n\nThe DNC leaks proved to be just the beginning. News soon broke that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had also been hacked, and on August 12, DCCC documents started showing up on Guccifer\u2019s Wordpress site. Guccifer also sent the DCCC\u2019s internal turnout model data to Florida Republican Party operative Aaron Nevins, who was positively thrilled to receive it. \u201cHoly fuck man I don\u2019t think you realize what you gave me,\u201d Nevins wrote in a DM. \u201cThis is probably worth millions of dollars.\u201d Nevins soon put it online on his anonymously run blog.\n\nThen DCLeaks got in the game. On August 12, the site posted a few emails from some little-known Republican state party aides, and from campaign advisers to Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were known as Russia hawks. In September, the site\u2019s anonymous administrators sent Colin Powell\u2019s phished emails to reporters, revealing his candid assessments of both Clinton (\u201cgreedy\u201d) and Trump (\u201cnational disgrace\u201d).\n\nDCLeaks then posted phished emails from Ian Mellul, an Obama White House staffer who had volunteered for Clinton. The Mellul documents included a picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport and a months-old audio file in which Hillary Clinton said Sanders\u2019s young supporters were \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement.\u201d Longtime Clinton ally Capricia Marshall\u2019s phished emails came next.\n\nMany of these disclosures caused brief stirs, but what everyone was really waiting for was the next WikiLeaks dump. Roger Stone, the Trump associate, claimed that he knew Assange had something huge on the way and speculated it would involve the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAssange himself told Fox News back on August 24 that his team had \u201cthousands of pages of material\u201d and was \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to prepare it for publication. By early October, there was still nothing from WikiLeaks, but Stone continued to hype an imminent release, saying \u201can intermediary\u201d who\u2019d met with Assange said \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmother lode\u201d instead came two days later, on Friday, October 7, when WikiLeaks posted its first batch of Podesta\u2019s emails. The site would continue to post them, in batches, up through the election. Earlier on that very same day, the US government officially attributed the hacking effort to the Russian government, and the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape hit the news.\n\nIn the end, the 2016 election was close, decided by just over 1 percentage point in three Electoral College states. And whether or not the email leaks were sufficient to swing the outcome, they certainly were effective at keeping the words \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cemails\u201d in the headlines throughout the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\n\nTrump associates tried to get in touch with hackers or leakers at least six separate times\n\nDuring the campaign, it was clear enough that Trump was unusually friendly to Russia, and that the Russian government interventions seemed aimed at trying to help his electoral chances at the expense of Hillary Clinton. But after the election, more and more attention became devoted to whether Trump associates and Putin\u2019s government coordinated to intervene in the campaign in some way. And on March 20, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating just that topic.\n\nNo one has produced a smoking gun demonstrating clear involvement just yet. But this isn\u2019t mere idle speculation, either \u2014 there are at least six instances in which Trump associates tried to get Russian dirt or communicated with hacking and leaking figures. The first of them was what initiated the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia to begin with:\n\n1) The Papadopoulos tip: Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign targeted Clinton staffers and Democrats in large numbers in March and April 2016, but the hacks remained publicly unknown for months afterward. Yet it was very early indeed \u2014 on April 26 \u2014 that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got his tip about what was coming.\n\nAs described above, the tip was from a source Papadopoulos understood to have Russian government connections, professor Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud specifically said he\u2019d gained his information from traveling to Moscow and meeting high-level officials there. And he said Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and, specifically, thousands of emails.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know whether he told others in the Trump campaign about what he\u2019d heard. But it seems highly likely that he did. He was a young adviser eager to impress campaign higher-ups. And we already know he drunkenly bragged about his inside info to an Australian diplomat a few weeks later. (The Australians later told the FBI, which led the bureau to open the investigation.)\n\nIn any case, Papadopoulos was arrested last summer for making false statements to FBI investigators, cut a plea deal, and began cooperating with investigators. So whatever he did do with his tip, Mueller likely now knows it.\n\n2) The Trump Tower meeting: It was on June 3, 2016 \u2014 a little more than a month after Papadopoulos\u2019s tip, but still before any news broke about Democrats having been hacked \u2014 that publicist Rob Goldstone emailed an acquaintance of his, Donald Trump Jr. Goldstone described some news from his clients Aras and Emin Agalarov, a father-son pair of real estate developers who\u2019d done business with the Trumps:\n\nThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.\n\nDon Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer, and Goldstone arranged a meeting six days later, on June 9. The Trump delegation included Don Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner. They met Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov company executive Ike Kaveladze, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator Anatoli Samochornov.\n\nOnce the existence of the meeting became public, all parties involved claimed it was a dud, resulting in nothing of consequence. But the timing of the meeting is strange. Three days later, Assange announced he\u2019d received emails related to Hillary Clinton. Two days after that, the DNC announced it had been hacked and blamed Russia.\n\nGoldstone saw an article about that and emailed it to Emin and Kaveladze, writing that the news was \u201ceerily weird\u201d considering what they\u2019d just discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. Guccifer 2.0 began posting the day after that.\n\n3) The Cambridge Analytica CEO\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Cambridge Analytica is the Steve Bannon-tied firm that did digital work for the Trump campaign and has been in the news of late.\n\nAnd last year, we learned that Cambridge\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, had twice contacted WikiLeaks on the topic of hacked emails.\n\nNix says that in \u201cearly June,\u201d after he learned of Assange\u2019s claims to have Hillary Clinton-related emails, he reached out to Julian Assange to ask for an advance look at those emails. He says Assange turned him down.\n\nThen in August, after Assange had posted the DNC emails, Nix emailed Cambridge employees to say that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, offering help at organizing the DNC material on WikiLeaks. He said he hadn\u2019t yet heard back. Both Nix and Assange have said these overtures didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\n4) Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Then, separately, Donald Trump Jr. had some communications with WikiLeaks through the group\u2019s Twitter account toward the end of the campaign.\n\nAs best we know, WikiLeaks began the communication, DMing Don Jr. to tell him that they had guessed the password to a new \u201cPAC run anti-Trump site,\u201d PutinTrump.org, that was about to launch. \u201cAny comments?\u201d the group asked. Trump Jr. answered: \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d\n\nThen on October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks DMed Don Jr. again, asking him to \u201ccomment on\u201d or \u201cpush\u201d a story that Hillary Clinton had once said she wanted to \u201cjust drone\u201d Assange. Don Jr. answered, \u201cAlready did that earlier today. It\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d\n\nHe then followed up with a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?\u201d This was at the height of chatter that WikiLeaks had a major batch of anti-Clinton material ready. However, there is no indication that WikiLeaks answered this question from Don Jr. or gave him any advance information that it was Podesta\u2019s emails that were coming. The group sent him a couple more messages, but there are no more known responses from Don Jr.\n\n5) Roger Stone\u2019s several contacts with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks: Roger Stone is a longtime Republican operative with a reputation for dirty tricks and a decades-long relationship with Donald Trump. Stone was only an official Trump campaign adviser briefly, departing the operation in early August 2015 after clashing with other staffers. But he remained in Trump\u2019s orbit and, to some extent, in communication with the candidate himself afterward.\n\nBoth in public and in private, Stone was fixated on the hackings and leaks.\n\nOne associate of Stone\u2019s claimed to the Washington Post that at some point in the spring of 2016, before news of the hackings broke, Stone said he\u2019d learned from Julian Assange that WikiLeaks had obtained emails that would hurt Democrats. (Stone denies this.)\n\nThe initial leaks from Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks were posted in June and July. On August 4, Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser and longtime associate Sam Nunberg: \u201cI dined with Julian Assange last night,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. (Stone says this was a joke and flight records prove he wasn\u2019t in London then.)\n\nThe day after that email, on August 5, Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer\u2019s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued Russia probably wasn\u2019t responsible. He also tweeted that \u201cJulian Assange is a hero.\u201d\n\nThree days later, on August 8, Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information. \u201cI actually have communicated with Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there\u2019s no telling what the October surprise may be.\u201d\n\nA few days after that, Stone began tweeting at, and eventually DMing with, Guccifer 2.0 (who, again, has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer). Some of these DMs later leaked, leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange. The posted messages are mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive.\n\nOn August 21, Stone tweeted an odd prediction: \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.\u201d Many would later point to this \u2014 which came months before the Podesta emails became public \u2014 and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak. (Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone\u2019s old friend Paul Manafort\u2019s Ukraine work, he was merely predicting \u201cPodesta\u2019s business dealings would be exposed.\u201d)\n\nAs October began, Stone took on a new role \u2014 as WikiLeaks\u2019 hype man. He again claimed inside knowledge, saying a \u201cfriend\u201d of his met with Assange and learned \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d He tweeted: \u201cWednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.\u201d And when nothing came on Wednesday, Stone tweeted, \u201cLibs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming. #Lockthemup.\u201d Assange published the Podesta emails two days later.\n\nImmediately, there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved, which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group \u201chas never communicated with Roger Stone.\u201d The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward, complaining that they were \u201cattacking\u201d him. \u201cThe false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications,\u201d WikiLeaks responded. \u201cDon\u2019t go there if you don\u2019t want us to correct you.\u201d Stone shot back: \u201cHa! The more you \u2018correct\u2019 me the more people think you\u2019re lying. Your operation leaks like a sieve. You need to figure out who your friends are.\u201d\n\nWhat to make of all this? Stone was obviously in contact with two of the key leakers, and his own public statements show that at one point he wanted people to think he had an inside line on WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. However, he\u2019s repeatedly denied any inside knowledge or involvement, and we haven\u2019t seen any clear evidence that he truly had such knowledge.\n\nIn any case, we might learn more from Mueller\u2019s probe soon enough. \u201cThey want me to testify against Roger,\u201d Sam Nunberg said this year, referring to the special counsel\u2019s team. \u201cThey want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.\u201d\n\n6) Peter Smith\u2019s hunt for Hillary\u2019s deleted emails: Last but certainly not least, there is one more email-related subplot to the 2016 campaign \u2014 and it\u2019s a weird one.\n\nThis one involves a separate set of emails: When word got out that Hillary Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department, she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators. But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails (about half of the total) to be \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than work-related, and deleted them.\n\nConservatives like longtime Republican operative Peter Smith didn\u2019t take Clinton\u2019s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value and questioned whether they could have contained scandalous behavior or criminal evidence. Their number included GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens. That will be next.\u201d\n\nIt was around this time that Smith began an unusual project. He assumed that Clinton\u2019s email server had been hacked and that her emails must be out there somewhere, on the \u201cdark web.\u201d So he reached out to computer experts and conservative activists, hoping to assemble a team that would track down those emails.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t work for the Trump campaign. But he is said to have repeatedly claimed to be in contact with Michael Flynn, who was advising Trump. One recruiting document Smith sent to cybersecurity expert Matt Tait contained the subheader \u201cTrump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure).\u201d It then listed several names: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Flynn, and Lisa Nelson. (Bannon and Conway have denied any involvement. The other three haven\u2019t commented.)\n\nEventually, Smith gave his version of what happened to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shane Harris. He said his team found five hacker groups who said they had Clinton\u2019s emails, of which two seemed to be Russian. \u201cWe knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,\u201d Smith said. However, he went on, he couldn\u2019t determine whether the emails were authentic, so he ended up just advising the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks. No such emails have ever surfaced. Smith \u2014 81 years old and in poor health \u2014 killed himself in May 2017, 10 days after speaking to Harris.\n\nSmith\u2019s effort appears to have failed. But Smith admitted he had tried to get stolen documents from groups he understood to be Russian government-tied. And then there is the question of Michael Flynn\u2019s role \u2014 particularly since, per Harris\u2019s sources, there are intelligence reports that say Russian hackers discussed how they could get leaked emails into Flynn\u2019s hands. Much remains murky about this situation, but Flynn is cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team as part of a plea deal, so the special counsel likely now knows whatever he does.\n\nMueller will likely bring charges in the email hacking matter. But against whom?\n\nLast November, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber reported that the Justice Department had identified more than six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack and was considering bringing charges.\n\nInterestingly, though, the report claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller had chosen not to take over the DNC hack investigation because it was \u201crelatively technical\u201d and had already \u201cbeen under way for nearly a year.\u201d\n\nThat appears to have since changed. Both NBC News and the Daily Beast reported in March that Mueller had now taken charge of the email hacking investigation. And the Washington Post reported in January that Mueller had added \u201ca veteran cyber prosecutor,\u201d Ryan Dickey, to his team. (Credit to Marcy Wheeler for flagging this point.)\n\nSo it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that Mueller will bring some charges related to the email hackings. And judging by his past indictments, he\u2019ll also use them to tell a story about what exactly happened, to the extent he can. There is, after all, a good deal we still don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how, exactly, did the DNC and Podesta emails get from the hackers to WikiLeaks?\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this is all just what we know about \u2014 there could be more that is still not public. It is certainly possible that several of their contacts with real or purported leakers and hackers listed above went nowhere, but it\u2019s a bit harder to believe that all six of those separate contacts resulted in nothing of consequence.\n\nMueller has already gotten three people tied to Trump to plead guilty and cooperate with the investigation. What is he getting from George Papadopoulos, who got the earliest known tip that the Russians hacked the emails? What is he getting from Michael Flynn, who may have been tied to Peter Smith\u2019s effort to get Clinton emails from Russian hackers? What was he getting from Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort\u2019s right-hand man both before and during the campaign?\n\nAll three men have pleaded guilty, and we haven\u2019t seen any of the fruits of their cooperation yet. They may be providing Mueller information about the hacked emails, and they may not. But it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re telling Mueller a good deal that\u2019s of interest \u2014 and eventually, we will find out what.",

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn\u2019t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.\n\nIf Trump were to appear at Prince Harry\u2019s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.\n\nInstead of a state visit, Trump\u2019s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a \u201cworking trip\u201d where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go \u201cone better\u201d than Obama\u2019s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.\n\nRead more: Melania Trump \u201cwent bananas\u201d when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'\n\nThe Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

    "text":"It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call \u2018fake news\u2019 today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? \u2018Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o\u2019er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth\u2019s fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n",

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking \u201cout of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,\u201d according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a \u201csanctuary county\u201d in May 2014. The county only cooperates with \u201cICE holds\u201d if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years.

He is expected to be there.\n\nKnowing what we know about Prince William, he would rather be at the wedding than at a soccer game. However, it's not just a soccer game and he's not just a spectator, he's the FA president. He has been for over a decade.\n\nEach and every year, the FA president is expected to be in attendance at the final game at Wembley Stadium. The president's job is also to award the final cup trophy to the winning team.\n\nThis long-standing tradition and a popular England sporting event will be a hard one for Prince William to miss.\n\nWhile this quandary isn't unexpected news to Prince William, he's been thinking about it for months. In an interview with radio broadcaster Rio Ferdinand in January, he expressed his upcoming dilemma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision, are we going to Wembley, or are we going to...?\u201d William asking Rio. \u201cYou\u2019ve touched on something there, Rio, yeah.

The wedding is at noon, and the soccer game is at 5:30 p.m.\n\nBeing 20 miles apart from each other, he could attend the reception at St. George's Chapel and take his helicopter to Wembley to present the trophy. After that, he could travel back to the evening reception at the Frogmore House.\n\nThere is no final word yet as to what Prince William will do.

However, clues exist in the last shutdown, which was in 2013.\n\nKey services will continue, and many agencies plan to use carryover funds to remain open for several days. But each day the shutdown lasts adds to the pressure on agencies, government employees and civilian contractors, as well as Americans who rely on various federal services.\n\nEmployees considered \u201cessential\u201d will still be required to report to work should the shutdown continue, while those in positions deemed \u201cnonessential\u201d will be barred from coming in.\n\nThe White House on Friday pledged to minimize the effects of the shutdown on the American people, with one official noting that the administration has urged government agencies \u201cto do as much as they can\u201d within the law to maintain operations.\n\nThe push for departments and agencies to utilize existing funding to remain open suggests the Trump administration is hedging its bets that lawmakers can reach a deal and avoid a shutdown the length of one in 2013, which lasted 16 days.\n\nEach federal agency has a contingency plan for a shutdown that is written with help from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. But the impact of the shutdown, which began at midnight when the Senate failed to pass a short-term spending bill, is likely to trickle down gradually as agencies work to mitigate the effects.\n\nAbout half of the Department of Health and Human Services will be placed on furlough. Beneficiaries of programs like Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid will still receive services. The Food and Drug Administration, however, will take a hit, as it will have to halt activities like food safety inspections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue \u201cimmediate response work\u201d on influenza, according to White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyOvernight Finance: Lawmakers see shutdown odds rising | Trump calls for looser rules for bank loans | Consumer bureau moves to revise payday lending rule | Trump warns China on trade deficit Overnight Regulation: Dems claim 50 votes in Senate to block net neutrality repeal | Consumer bureau takes first step to revising payday lending rule | Trump wants to loosen rules on bank loans | Pentagon, FDA to speed up military drug approvals Consumer bureau takes first step to revising payday lending rule MORE.\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) will keep parks open, unlike in 2013, though much of its staff will not report to work. Services such as trash pickup and restroom cleaning will be halted, according to the NPS contingency plan for a shutdown.\n\nCybersecurity will remain a priority during the shutdown, as the government will continue to protect information technology systems, Mulvaney said Saturday at a press conference.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency will largely stay open during the government's closure, and the Labor Department will resume mine safety inspections.\n\nMilitary personnel will be required to show up for work, but will not receive pay for as long as the shutdown lasts. Families of slain military members will experience a halt to death benefits as a result of the shutdown.\n\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel will continue operations, meaning travelers will see both TSA employees and canines operating in airports. The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) management of air traffic control will also continue. Flight delays are not expected and much of the FAA's safety inspections will continue.\n\nThe government closure, a result of Congress\u2019s failed negotiations over a spending bill the last several weeks, has sparked both intraparty battles and fights between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe two parties have each tried to cast blame on the other for the shutdown, with the Republican National Committee invoking the hashtag #SchumerShutdown, referring to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerDemocrats will need to explain if they shut government down over illegal immigration White House: Trump remarks didn't derail shutdown talks Schumer defends Durbin after GOP senator questions account of Trump meeting MORE (D-N.Y.).

Both chambers returned to Capitol Hill on Saturday afternoon to work toward a solution.",

    "text":"\u201cThe immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,\u201d George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. \u201cThis kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it\u2019s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president\u2026 is pretty unusual.\u201d\n\nAs Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he\u2019s made his displeasure clear.\n\nObama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the protests following Trump\u2019s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump\u2019s attempts to repeal it.\n\nAt a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. \u201cI expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,\u201d Obama said Sunday.\n\nAnd on Monday, Obama\u2019s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump\u2019s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn\u2019s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn\u2019s erratic nature.\n\nGeorge W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. \u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Bush said in an interview with \u201cToday\u201d in February. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.\u201d\n\nAs for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. \u201cI am for an immigration policy that\u2019s welcoming and upholds the law,\u201d Bush said.\n\nCarter also voiced concerns after Trump\u2019s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women\u2019s movement would be \u201cinvigorated\u201d by Trump and that he didn\u2019t see \u201cany glimmer of hope\u201d from the administration on race and gender issues.\n\nBill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman\u2019s presidential campaign, didn\u2019t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know much,\u201d Clinton said in late December. \u201cOne thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.\n\nCriticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that\u2019s not really unprecedented,\u201d Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. \u201cIf it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.\u201d\n\nWhile in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.\n\n\u201cMost of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,\u201d Mack McLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, said.\n\nFor example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.\n\nOthers primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.\n\n\u201cWhat would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cIf we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.\u201d\n\nAll in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.\n\nBut Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by their first post-election meeting.\n\nTrump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS\u2019 John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.\n\n\u201cHe was very nice to me, but after that, we\u2019ve had some difficulties,\u201d Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama speaks at a community event on the Presidential Center at the South Shore Cultural Center, Wednesday, May 3, 2017, in Chicago. The Obama Foundation unveiled plans for the former president's lakefront presidential center, showcasing renderings and a model at an event where former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were expected to give more details. (AP Photo\/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nHistorically speaking, Trump\u2019s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors\u2019 had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. \u201cThat one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,\u201d she said\n\nAnd Trump hasn\u2019t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy!\u201d as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush \u201cnot nice\u201d during the campaign, said the Bush administration \u201clied\u201d about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton \u201cthe WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and Carter weren\u2019t excluded from Trump\u2019s slights. \u201cEnough is Enough- No More Bushses!\u201d Trump tweeted during the campaign. He alsocriticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.\n\nSteven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.\n\nAnd Carter hasn\u2019t always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and \u2014 while revealing that he voted for Sanders \u2014 Carter said the \u201cdownturn\u201d of human rights \u201cpreceded 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Carter, I think he hopes that he won\u2019t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cActually, I\u2019m sure he would.\u201d\n\nBoth Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush\u2019s chief of staff. He\u2019s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.\n\n\u201cThey may have personal opinions, but they\u2019re not going to express them,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cBoth 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they\u2019ve been both very cautious about what they say.\u201d\n\nMcLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today\u2019s events in Washington.\n\n\u201cI think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,\u201d he said.",

If you\u2019re looking for a safe place to place your bets, look for a sportsbook with an easy-to-navigate website and fast payout speeds. Some sportsbooks also offer a variety of bonuses to attract customers. These include first-bet insurance, reload bonuses and parlay boosts.\n\nSome of these bonuses are offered during the NFL season, while others are available throughout the year. Typically, the sportsbook will provide a bonus in the form of site credit, which you need to roll over at least once before you can keep your winnings. In some cases, the sportsbook will also refund your stake if you lose.\n\nRegardless of the sportsbook you choose, it\u2019s important to understand how odds are calculated. Most online sportsbooks display the odds of a particular event, and you can use these to determine your chances of winning. In addition, most of these websites have calculators that can help you estimate your potential winnings. These tools can save you a lot of time and hassle.\n\nThe most common way to bet on sports is at a physical bookmaker. These businesses are often licensed by state regulators and are regulated to ensure they operate ethically. However, they do have some disadvantages, such as high fees and limited market scope. Fortunately, there are many online sportsbooks that accept credit cards and other forms of payment. These options make it much easier to bet from the comfort of your home.\n\nWhen choosing a sportsbook, it\u2019s essential to find one that has a wide selection of betting markets. In addition to determining what sports you can bet on, it\u2019s also important to examine the betting limits and rules of each website. Some sportsbooks limit certain types of bets, while others have restrictions on the number of teams or players you can bet on.\n\nIn addition to offering a wide range of betting markets, an online sportsbook should have a high level of customer service. This means that it should be available round the clock, and have a secure deposit and withdrawal system. In addition, it should provide a variety of payment methods to meet the needs of different players.\n\nBecoming a sportsbook agent is an excellent choice for people who enjoy gambling and want to turn it into a full-time career. The sportsbook industry grew significantly in 2022, reeling in more than $52.7 billion in wagers. This increase in popularity has made it a more profitable and competitive business than ever before.\n\nA sportsbook that offers a deposit match promotion is a great way to get started with online betting. These offers give new bettors a chance to win real money by making their first bet. Some sites may offer this in cash, while others will give you site credit that can be used on future bets. Some even have first-touchdown insurance, which gives bettors a refund on their first wager if it loses.",

John Kasich vetoed the so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman\u2019s life or preventing the \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,\u201d Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. \u201cWomen are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cOur mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there\u2019s one very simple reason why I did it. That\u2019s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they\u2019re supposed to be closed, if she doesn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure she doesn\u2019t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we\u2019re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child \u2013 a being who\u2019s done no wrong and only exists as its mother\u2019s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you another thing \u2013 as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn\u2019t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,\u201d the governor concluded.",

    "text":"The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues.\n\nThis muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding:\n\nAnabolic Drugs Or Steroids\n\nAnabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain.\n\nThese hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein.\n\nBeta-2 Agonists\n\nThese synthetic drugs help expand the lungs\u2019 capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety.\n\nHuman Growth Hormone\n\nAlso referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH.\n\nEphedrine\n\nBodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles.\n\nMethenolone\n\nMethenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it.",

    "text":"California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day:\n\nAssembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if \u201cthe violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,\u201d the law states.\n\nAccording to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.\n\nWriter Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.\n\nAccording to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers \u201cshall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.\u201d\n\nSo as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be \u201cprovisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,\u201d the law states. \u2026\n\nThe new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses.\n\nThis new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers.\n\nEven worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions.\n\nIf the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.\n\nInstead they come up with stupid rules, designed to harm those who can least afford it.\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers' newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources.

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.\n\nSeveral children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.\n\nWhile Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201d\n\nHe said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. \u201cagainst our national interests.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who he\u2019s talking about and whether he\u2019s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.\n\nBut it obviously raises a concerning question.\n\nThere have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to believe.\n\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.\n\nThe problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can\u2019t get a straight answer.\n\nAsked about the cleric\u2019s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.\u201d Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official\u2019s allegation. \u201cThis sounds like totally made up BS,\u201d she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.\n\nThis would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.\n\nAnd in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran\u2019s elite. \u201cMany ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,\u201d Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. \u201cThe regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.\u201d Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: \u201cIranians don\u2019t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.\u201d\n\nThe protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didn\u2019t feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here.\n\nBut it could be interesting if it\u2019s the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back.",

Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn\u2019t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might\u2019ve been exposed to.\n\n(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)\n\nChemical attack or no, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn\u2019t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these \u201creal\u201d patients to confirm an attack.",

Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.\n\nA deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.\n\nThe defense team\u2019s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.\n\nWhen the defense counsel asked K.S., \u201cDid you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?\u201d she answered: \u201cNot to my knowledge. I didn\u2019t see him with it.\u201d\n\nThe question was then asked, \u201cAnd as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera \u2013 with a camera or a phone?\u201d\n\nK.S. replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nThe counsel then asked, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t say you saw it on his person, you can\u2019t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?\u201d\n\nK.S. answered, \u201cYes. I cannot say.\u201d\n\nTrying to salvage the state\u2019s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., \u201cDid you see what you believed to be a phone?\u201d\n\nHere comes the shocker. K.S. answered, \u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t talked about it because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m remembering it through a dream or I \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven\u2019t spoken about it because of that.\u201d\n\nK.S. remembered the photo incident \u201cthrough a dream\u201d? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.\n\nAs the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.\u2019s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.\n\nDefense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.",

Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.\n\nAmong many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nShe also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added. \u201cThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don\u2019t, if we let them get away with it, what\u2019s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that\u2019s happening by accident?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,\u201d she concluded.",

The school\u2019s chancellor, Malcolm Little, said that regardless of her status as a former first daughter, the rules are the rules and she won\u2019t be welcome there this fall.\n\nThe stunning announcement came after Malia was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends. Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is \u201cweed friendly,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she broke the rules.\n\nMalia\u2019s lawyer has pointed out that the school has turned the other way on the marijuana issue when their entire rowing team, made up of 14 white males, was caught selling and smoking marijuana cigarettes during the offseason. Chancellor Little remarked that the difference was that the members of the rowing team are hard-working, established students whose parents are paying cash for their education while Malia hasn\u2019t attended yet, isn\u2019t planning on playing a sport and is going to the school on a combination of a scholarship from the Clinton Foundation and taxpayer-funded grants.\n\nThe Obama family lawyer is planning on filing a discrimination suit, because isn\u2019t everything about race?",

Just like ultra left-wing Bernie Sanders supporter Caitlin Johnstone, Obama (Barry Soetoro as he was known in college while he was doing sexual favors for old men to get cocaine money) attacked a recovering John McCain viciously Wednesday night then deleted the tweet like a coward.\n\n\u201cJohn McCain is NOT a war hero,\u201d our Muslim former \u201cPresident\u201d said, adding that \u201cif there were any god in heaven\u201d the Senator would have died from his brain tumor.\n\nObama had previously tweeted out well wishings at 8:49 p.m. and apparently accidentally sent his REAL feelings (seemingly intended for a private message) which he quickly hid from the world.\n\nThe tweet was deleted within two minutes but was already shared by more than 73,000 liberals who want nothing more than to see someone who has served our country die in agony.He even brought God\u2019s name into it.\n\nObama has repeatedly attacked our servicemen for more than eight years, doing more damage to them than ISIS and al Qaeda combined according to a study done by the Freedom Coalition for Conservative Values\n\nYou have to realize that liberals like Obama pledged themselves to Satan long ago and are nothing but a bunch of idiot lowlifes.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump tweeted his thoughts and prayers to McCain because they are Christians who love everyone even if they have had their differences in the past:\n\nMelania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. pic.twitter.com\/SO4XYgnyug \u2014 President Trump (@POTUS) July 20, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to stand with our CHRISTIAN President Trump and oppose the liberal hatred, to continue fighting to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.",
