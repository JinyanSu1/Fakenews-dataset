# Adapting Fake News Detection to the Era of Large Language Models
# Fake News Detectors are Biased against Texts Generated by Large Language Models

The dataset was created based on politifact and gossipcop dataset from [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet), where we filter out the news articles that don't contain title or description. The orginial fake news and real news are used as **HF** and **HR** in our paper.

- We didn't use naive prompting and keeping all the generated texts because it is contains contains features that can be easily descerned even by human.(As shown in the following illustration)

## Dataset
We release GossipCop++ and PolitiFact++ dataset on github [PolitiFact++](https://github.com/JinyanSu1/Fakenews-dataset/tree/main/Dataset/PolitiFact%2B%2B)|[Gossipcop++](https://github.com/JinyanSu1/Fakenews-dataset/tree/main/Dataset/GossipCop%2B%2B) and on HuggingFace [PolitiFact++](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jinyan1/PolitiFact) |[GossipCop++](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jinyan1/GossipCop). 


## Dataset Statistics
These are the dataset statistics. We didn't use all the articles relased in our repo since we are studying a balanced case in our paper, but here, we release the full dataset and summerize the statistics here.
|          | **#HF** | **#MF**             | **#HR** | **#MR** |
